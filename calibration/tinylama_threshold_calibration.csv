"Mars is the fourth planet from the sun and since it is now 2016 it was about 40 years ago that a face was found on the planet. Some people think it was made by aliens and other people are logical and say it is a natral land form. I think it is just a land form because you can duscern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, we havent found anything else, and it look like some of the landforms here on earth. First of all, in paragraph 11 it says that as a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image up to 3 times its size. This helps prove it wasnt made by aliens because they cal close in on the picture and they didnt find anything else around it like other sculptures or houses or anything. therefore, it was either really old or just a land form. Also, we haven't found anything else on the planet. If aliens made that dont you think they would have made other things and if they did wouldnt they also be there. It is not likely the face is an artifact because there should be more and if it was made by aliens and they had more it is unlikely that they made them and only that one is still there. It does look a lot like what the agyptians made so if there were aliens they would probably be capable of doing that but it also looks like some of the landforms we have here on earth. Garvin even says in paragraph 12 ""It reminds me most of middle butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. hat's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated masa about the same height as the face on mars."" In conclution, It is just a natural landform that happens to look like a face. We havent found anything else on the planet and the ppicture doesnt have anything in it like a home. Also it looks like some of the landforms here on earth, we have some natural things that look wierd so why cant mars? The face was not made by aliens.",0,0.760928213596344
"Cars are the most convinient way to travel. Unlike public transport, you can go exectly where you want - without waiting, without detours.
If zou have a lot to transport, like a peace of furnature you can just put it in the trunk - given that zour car is big enough. Riding by bus would be very impractical, getting through the doors, finding enough space.
You might thing that the bus is ceaper, and maybe sometimes it is, but as soon as you aren't traveling alone the expensives for the fuel can be shared. Time is also of importance, even trains beeing very fast traveling from one citz to another, you normaly need a lot of time until you reach your final destination. You will have to get a bus or subway, which may be late, and in the end you would have been quicker using a car. 

Besides of being more practical, there is also a psychological aspect to it. Your car is something you have earned, somthing you can be proud of. And most important, it belongs to you. So you are not quit in public when you drive your car. It's like you are still on your own teritorry. And it is also a common symbol of status, and who wants to give that up? I shure do not.

Of cause there are problemes, like rising fuel prices. But I think that ways will be found to solve them. Even today there are cars which dont need fuel based on oil. So when the last oilwells dry out, the cars won't lack of fuel - because when it happens cars won't need fuel anymore.

I think the car is so convinient, and liked by so many of us, that we will find a solution to any problem that might endanger our beloved automobil.",0,0.853318452835083
"Dear Principal, I think the policy in which cell phones are allowed during free time is better than no cell phones at all. Even if you banned cell phones it wouldn't stop kids from bringing them to school. Kids like to keep in touch, which is why they have cell phones. Since they can't talk in class texting is more sneaky than writhing paper notes and throwing them around the classroom where the teachers are watching. Its also a good time to call parents in free time if they are staying after school of they are riding home with a friend's parent. It feels less tense than asking a teacher to use your cell phone or using the school's phone. If kids are allowed to have their cell phones during free time there may be a chance they won't use their cell phone in class in return. Besides, if they aren't allowed to use their cell phones in school there is a chance they would use it in class and look cool doing it. It would just get other people trying to do it too. And if you are going to let cell phones in school, you have to enforce the rules better than with the 'no cell phones' rule. Give a big consequence if they decide to go against the rules, Like a lunch or an after school detention. Or maybe get their cell phone taken away and they can only get it back after class or school. Also you could probably send it to you, the principal's office where the can get it after school or by rules have a parent pick up the phone. If you enforce this rule you could make all the students sign a contract that they will only use their cell phones during lunch or free time or else they may have to face consequences such as the ones mentioned before. Tell them that this is not a freedom but a privilege. I think you should allow cell phones to be in school but just at lunch or a free time. That way everyone gets what they want. Kids actually get the opportunity to actually use cell phones at school. If kids get more freedom, so do you. I think you will be very surprised how many students will agree and respect this rule. Kids want to use their cell phones so I'm pretty sure no one will be breaking this policy. You, the principal can be rest assured that kids are using their cell phones at a free time but not in class. And if there were anything to happen with this rule you can always have the right to remove this rule and ban cell phones in school once and for all. Thank you, STUDENT_NAME",0,0.7615571618080139
"On this essay, it will be explain how it's worthy to study the planet Venus, despite the dangers it presents for the human being and how it could be done. Venus is often categorized as Earth's ""twin"" in terms of density and size, and often times closes in distance too. But whythe scientists are willing to take the risk to study Venus even though that it is dangerous? As the following passage says "" Astronomers are facinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in out solar system. Long ago,Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet as a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters"" giving to the reader how long ago, Venus was and is the most Earth-like planet in the solar system. The risk to goto Venus, are pretty big. ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging arethe clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" On these passage it shows some of the risk of Venus, and even the planet surface is over 800 degrees Farenheit,and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater that what experience on our planet. ""Also notable,Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun."" here is explaining the temperature of the surface of the planet Venus. On the seek to learning more of Venus, the NASA is working on another approaches to studying Venus. "" For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" Here the NASA is giving the example of one project that could work to explore Venus on three weeks until it deteriorates. "" Another project is looking back to and old technology called mechanical computers. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played and important role in the 1940s during World War II... By comparison,systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces"" On these passage it's explained how the technology made on the past can be more resistant on Venus that the technology of today,even though that it is more powerful, flexible, and quick. In conclution, exploring Venus can be a big proggres to the Earth, giving the challenges that Venus can give to the humans, These would help expand and meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. And, who knows? Maybe we will be able to live in Venus one day, but not until we decide to do the first step.",0,0.819242000579834
"Dear Principal, You could not be more correct in stating that all students must maintain a grade B average to participate in athletics. All schools provide learning experiences to even the best athletes in the nation. They must learn and do well in school even if they have a future in their sport. Sports are also a privilege; students must be competent in their studies in order to be able to be allowed to play their sport. There have been people who have excelled in their sport and had a bright future ahead of them until they faced a career ending injury to disable them from playing again. Habits start in middle school. You must have a good work ethic to focus on schoolwork along with athletics. This prepares you for high school and college, where the schools are much more serious about maintaining a good grade. Players are suspended often in sports, especially college basketball, for being unsatisfactory in their work. Yet again, the students might have a bright future, but one little slip can ruin a whole sports career. You need something to back that up. For example, Greg Oden, an NBA player, is injured very badly and has only played in about five games in two seasons. The team he is on might let him go and he will not have a good job because he does not have a degree from college. He should have thought about his grades more. They are important even though he thought that he had a star career ahead of him. Sports are a privilege, not a requirement. Students are in school not only learn the raw material such as math and reading, but they learn values, qualities and sportsmanship. Failure to comply with the rules of the school must mean the player may not comply with the rules of his or her team. Disrespect and unsportsmanlike qualities can give a bad impression to other schools. Teams are the face of the school. They are what other people see. If these people see the players on their teams fooling around and causing trouble, they will think less of the school. That is not what we want our school to be looked at as. I would like our school to have quality athletic programs, but I also want our students to go pro in something other than sports too. Maintaining a grade B average will allow our students to be a level above the rest. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME",0,0.7724898457527161
"I'm a scientist at NASA and I know that the face is just a natural landform. I have plenty of reasons why that is, and why it wouldn't be an alien. Yes, the face on Mars has become a pop icon, but that doesn't mean people could just assume it's an alien. NASA has plenty information and data for why it's just a natural landform. I'll explain my thinking as me being a scientist at NASA. My first reason is that NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The picture noted a huge rock formation which seemed to be a human head that had eyes, nose, and mouth. You just have to think about it, those characteristics are obvious. I mean yes, it was found in Mars, but that doesn't mean it couldn't have been a human. People just have to think more into the possible and not the impossible, because everything is possible. My second reason is that they photographed the face. Other scientists at NASA saw that it clearly looked like a human head. My third reason is that they even snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos! When the image first appeared on a JPL web site, it clearly revealed a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. This is why I, as a scientist at NASA think it's a natural landform and not an alien. these three reasons I have should make people think about it again and decide it's officially a human head. Those who believe it's an alien, should believe more in miracles. Anything could happen in Mars or any other place around the planet. This is only my opinion, but it sure makes me feel like I'm right about my thinking.",0,0.7904085516929626
"Mr:Senator I am in favor of keeping the election by popular vote for the president of the United States. I think our country deserve the right to elect our president the person thats going to make the laws and better things for us. Some of the people yet can't vote but they watch the interviews the campains you make. What you are preparing for us for the future for our childrens parents and animals. For every single thing and we judge you the way we think is supposed to be we want our country to be better to be the best. We dont want some people we dont even know how they think to select something for us.Alright maybe sometimes we make wrong elections but we all humans and if we make the wrong decition later we can't judge you because we elect our president our ''saver''. Electoral collage is not a bad option but Im in favor of voting by popular vote for the president of the United State. Voting is a privilage we have it let us use it. Let us pick and make our mistake. Try to tell us by the campians congresist let us know you. The way you think so we can be sure in what hands our putting our futures our sons and daughters future. The electoral collage constists in 538 electors. A majoritiy of 270 electoral votes is requiered to elect the President. The presidential election is held every four years on Tusday after Monday in Novemeber. New year isn't a new life. The elections is new taxes, new laws, new benefits. Thats a new life.When you vote for a president you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. Democrats and Repunblicans they all had have ups and downs. But they still make their elections. Being in favor of election by popular vote give us the people the right to decide. The right to choose something good our bad the right to know what we need and want from the new President. If we choose by popular vote is that more people want somebody because that somebody offers something better. Because everyone or allmost everyone is confident about that man. About what his offering us. Elecitng our president by popular vote ill be a great idea. You will make the people happy. And you are giving us the place as citizens of the United States that we deserved. These is the greates country, this is the best country in the hall world everyone want to come here because of the equal rights you give us. Because the liberty of expretion. Thats a previlage. Aren't we allow to use it to the the maximun. This is a free country and we had to fight hard for that our ansesters. Electing our President of the Unirted States by popular vote is the best they could do. Im in favor of it and that's my opinion.",0,0.849553108215332
"Lukes participation in the Seagoing Cowboys program allowed him to expierence different adventures and visit many unique places. Also he can take care of hores,young cows,and mules that are shiped over sea and on there way to greece Luke turned 18 which meant he could be drafted for military school.They were on a cattle boat for a trip By the time he was discharged in 1947 Luke had made nine trips which was the most of any Seagoing Cowboy Luke had fun when the animals were releasted out of their cage the cowboys also played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed thoses games also helped time go by. Sea Cowboys were much more than a trip to Luke Bomberger it oped up the world it helped other countries and their needs and to help them survive and to stay healthy and to have a good life and good choices. That stayed with Luke Bomberger and it led him to leading a number of internalional students and exchange visitors for many years.

"I think it will be good in a couple years because some people can't really drive without help because the sensors will be more advance. It can really do wonders to peoples lives in the future such as going out easier being safe and more efficient. But you still need a driver's license if you want to drive a smart car because when there is a something major going on the car can't sense what other people are going to do. I really think it can do good in the future with the more advance sensors on the cars and we may have better technology. I think it can do real good in this world like herlping people that can be hurt or in pain. In paragraph 5 and 7 they have great detail of how it will help advance more in the future. In paragraph 7 they said,""None of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" They are not fully there yet on the selfless driving subject but they will be soon because in paragraph 5 has detail on that because it said,""Within 10 years, those sensors had become more advanced to detect amd respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. The information from thr sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a humman driver could manage alone. Further improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own."" It will be advanced in the future. I really hope one day it will happen because we are damaging the plant by using the cars we are using now. It will damage the future for our children and future generations by doing what we are doing we need stop it because we don't want to have future generation clean up what we already can clean up now. So I do hope and dream the smart car can help with this problem in a couple years. Just help save the plant and leave it clean for generatons to come.",0,0.8582857251167297
"Dear state senator I think that you should keep the Electoral Collage because it is a collage that requires a presidential canidate to have a trans-regional appeal. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recivies a majority of the votes cast. The Electoral College is a method of choosing the president of the United States and that is really importnt that we have a president. The Founding Fathers established the Electoral College because it's in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral Collage is very important to the United States we should keep the collage. In some cases people depend on the Electoral collage they chose who will be President and like state goveners that is very impornant that the founding fathers made the Electoral Collage. In 1976, tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559voters in ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had votes he other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.",0,0.7057692408561707
"Dear,Mr Senator My name is PROPER_NAME, and I am writing to you to say why we should keep the elctoral college. What do you think, should we keep the electoral college? wirte me back and tell me what you think. but any way these are my three reason on why we should keep the electoral college. My first reason is on why we should keep the electoral college is because, there is a reason on why it is there in the first place. Im not that smart but im pretty sure the founding fathers knew what they were doing when they started the electoral college. it is there because it helps pick who is president and vice president. I mean sure we do help by voting but there job is to pick the best one, by compareing statistics. My second reason for why we should keep the electoral college is because the people arent always right. Yes i said that the people arent always right, take for instance the George Bush we messed up big time by electing him, look what happened to the economy, but that is what we get by letting the peple pick. Im not saying that we dont know how to make a right descion but can we please let the professionals do what they do best. My third and final reason is that they do elect fairly the bigger thye state you have the mor represenatives you recive, states like California,texas,wyoming,ect which means the bigger the state the more people sre going to live in that stae which would also mean that you would have more represenatives. i know that your saying how is that fair if just because you a bigger state you get more represenatives? well as i said in the last sentace it is because of population. because of population to even out the votes you would have to have more represenatives. Those were my top three reasons on why we should keep the electoral college. I hop that you agree with my reasons on why we should keep the electoral college. Yours truley PROPER_NAME (ps write me back and let me know your thoughts on why or why not we shold keep the electoral college",0,0.7436314225196838
"Lukes point of view is that Luke likes the Seagoing Cowboys program. Luke could convince others to partipate in the Seagoing Cowboys program by telling others how much fun he had, and all the things that he's seen on his trip there and back, also he could tell them how long it took him to get to the Seagoing Cowboys program, and how long it took to get back. Luke was happy because he turned 18 before arriving in greece, which meant he could be drafted for military service, and what he did for his service was was draft board learned that was on cattle-boat trip,they told Luke that he should just keep doing that for his service. It took Luke about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States, and a month to get to china, and what kept look busy was caring for the animals,the animals had to be fed and watered, two or three times a day, Luke had to pull bales of hay, and bags of oats, and the stalls had to be cleaned. On Lukes second trip, Luke served as night as watchman, his job was to check on all the animals every hour,and one rainy night after Luke making his hourly report to the captain, he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside, Lukes heart raced as he shot feet first toward an opening on his side or the ship, and a strip of metal along the edge of the ship stopped his slied,keeping him from flying overboard in to the dark Atlantic, he was happy alive, but he couldn't work for a couple of days because he cracked his ribs.So Lukes trip was good and bad, but atleast Luke made it home safe and sound.",0,0.8447204828262329
"People always imagine the future with flying cars, robots as servents, and everything white. Similar to this idea, car manufactring companies are coming up with driverless cars. This is an idea where you dont have to have a driver in the car. The car drives all by itself to your destination. Most people would think that this is an amazing thing to accomplish/build. People are thinking so much about the poitives of this idea, that they are not thinking of the negatives. So many things to think about. Would if you got in an accident? would you blame the driver or the manufacturer?, not to mention that the cost of making these cars would be outrageous!, and if we had these cars, people would be so dependent on them and they would be so independent as a person. Imagine yourself just crusing along in your car and your relaxing because the car is driving itslef. All of a sudden you get in a car crash! someone id badly injured. you get out of the car to talk to the peson about your insurance an everything. Who do you think they would blame for the car crash and the accident? the driver or the manufacturer? ""Still, even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault--the driver or the manufacturer?"" This quote indicates that there are a lot of thing that would need to change if we actually made this car, including car insurance. You never know what could happen with a car like this. Its just safer to driveon your own, than to put your life in the hands of a driveless car that has the potential of hurting not only you, but other people as well. has anone even realized how the car will be built? People think that this car is just going to be made plain and simple. Thats not the case. These cars are going to be expensive to make. Its not like they are only going to make one driverless car, they are going to make hundreds of thouands of them. And they are going to be very very expensive to make.The tax money that we all pay would probably go to making these cars instead of something important like filling potholes, or making better streets. Our hard earned money would go to this instead of something that we are in dire need of. It would be a waste of our money. We as people would be so independent if we had this car because we would rely on it to take us to all the places that we need to go. We would be so independent because we wouldnt know the city of country like we did before the driverless car came out. Its almost like we wouldnt know where we live anymore. We would probably forget how to drive and everything. Overall i think that this is just a bad idea because we have a lot of problems in this world and this does not have to be one of them.",0,0.8664556741714478
"The author does not support their idea of Venus being a planet worth exploring despite the risk and dangers very well. There are examples or facts that the author provides to the reader that are sometimes insignifigant to the point. The author also provides information that is very detrimental to their claim and only makes their aruement weaker. The reason why the information is detrimental is because the author fails to give any counter arguement that would be convincing enough to to at least have the reader understand their side. To start, in the third paragraph the author list many reasons why Venus is difficult to explore and ather information on. Later in the fourth paragraph the author talks about how enthusiastic scientist are to explore the planet and how it may have been like Earth at some point. If the author were to reorganize the fourth paragraph giving the teorey that Venus was once like Earth and then going on to give the inputs of scientist it would have made more sense going into the fifth paragraph. In paragraph five the author writes about how NASA has ideas on how scientist can observe Venus without entering its toxic and dangerous enviornment. The author also explains the conditions the scientist would be under if they were to make this idea a reality and said conditions would make any who oppose this idea less open to the thought than they already are, which is not the point of the article. In paragraph six the author talks about how while scientist could observe Venus if they were to go through with the plan NASA has it would ultimatly be for nothing as scientist would have no way to gather information worth sending back. The author does have points that support the claim but said points were either useless to the overall idea or were organized in a poor manner. The author also provides arguements that counter their claim and says nothing to counter those arguements back. The author also talks about human exploratiom in the article but it essientially amounts to nothing. The reason why is because the author later goes on to talk about machines on the planet itself making most of the information provided before hand obselete. If the author left most of the article out the claim may have actually been supported well although the information provided woul have been lackluster.",0,0.7480680346488953
"Dear Principle, I think that students should have the right to have at least a C average because some of them may be having troubles at home. This could also meant that your star spiker or running back or anything could be out of the game and you do not want that. It could affect the lives of many people and their children and that would not be good at all. If students were only allowed to have B averages then this means that they would have to study a lot more and this can lead to a lack in sports efforts and or result in the loss of not being able to play the game that they like. If students are looking to get a football scholarship or even just a sports scholarship then yes they have to get good grades of course but what if they are always at practice and they never have time then to review for tests and or quizzes and the fail them then this means they cannot play. You should not take the player from the game because it is not fair. If Brett Farve, or even Eli Manning got bad grades then of course he could not play but this does not mean that he tried very hard to at least keep his grades up. This may result in smarter students but this then may mean that the sports teams may be bad because they spend all of their time on school, and trying to get better grades. Also no principle wants to have or represent a school that has a bad athletic ability and or team. it is not fair to the students who may not just be smart enough to comprehend what the are learning. If they can at least keep a C average I think things would still be good, and they could still have decent grades and still play their favorite sports. Without sports students may fail even more miserably because they know that they cannot play because of their grades. B averages of course could also help them. It just depends on the player and their ability's to learn in the classroom and on the court or the field. Without sports the school would have nothing fun to do for activities and it would just be boring for students and they may even hate the school even more than they do already, or they may switch to a school that has a C average and you could and may lose many students because of this new rule. Sports can play a big role in students lives because some of them may want to become professional. If they do become professional with all C averages then their grade does not really even matter anymore. All they are going to do is play that sport and their is no need for them to have to know anything besides what's going in the game and what to do in the game to be successful. There is also no pint in changing the grade letter for passing from B to C. Almost all schools or a majority of them have it so you at least have to have a C to pass because not all kids are smart and or have a good comprehension or learning ability. Like I said before in the top few paragraphs. America is a place that needs to be equal everywhere and I think that the letter grade should stay where it is and it should be made a state law because it has been this way for awhile and lots of students and parents and guardians may think that this is not fair. This is my view on the whole grades subject being changed. You do not want to break the heart of your students and it may affect you long term. If they come professional than they could be thankful for having all C averages and or better grades. You could be known around also it could fill your heart with happiness knowing that you helped a younger kid that is your student. Sincerely, The Editor",0,0.8393063545227051
"It has been estimated that during summer break, roughly 75 percent of students fail to retain critical information for their next year's classes. This is quite detrimental to a student's overall education, considering time will have to be spent relearning old information instead of new material. Because of this, some schools require students to complete summer projects, with the goal of keeping students learning even during their break. These summer projects should be created by teachers, enhancing the concept that authority plays a role in maintaining steady educational progress. Teachers are far more familiar with the curriculum than students. Teachers have spent years in the education system and know best how to prepare students for success in that environment. Teachers will on average spend four to five years attaining a degree in education, and will then spend the majority of their working years in the school system. Having spent so much time in and around the school system, they will have become incredibly familiar with the curriculum. This inherently generates an unparalleled level of experience with the material which teachers can effectively utilize to create projects that will better fit the education of their students. Teachers are more suited to designing projects that will relate to the next year's material. The majority of students do not know exactly what to expect heading into their next year of education. Specifically, one may know that they are taking calculus next year, but they will not know the level of importance past information holds in the upcoming class. Teachers, who have been dealing with the material surrounding their class for years, know all that which is relevant to the class, and how to design a project that will suit the necessary concepts. Because of the fact that teachers have spent so much time around the curriculum, by nature they will create projects which are far more effective in helping students retain or even learn new information during the summer break. Some believe that students should be the ones to design their summer assignments; however, this belief is faulty. Humans, and students especially, tend to live by the motto, ""Work smarter, not harder."" If given free reign or even partial credit in designing a summer project, the final product will be something so elementary that the students might as well have done nothing at all. Consider how students more often than not take advantage of late work deadlines, then think of how that might translate into the creation of a summer project. A summer project is not to be taken lightly, the whole point for its existence is to retain and potentially improve upon information learned last which will be critical for next year. Students will naturally take the easy way out on a summer project, and need an authority figure, namely a teacher, who is experienced enough in the curriculum to create a project for them. Teachers have an unrivaled level of experience in creating projects. A teacher's whole day is concerned with illustrating new concepts and ideas, and figuring out creative ways to demonstrate them. Teachers will on average create about 80-100 different lessons, tests, study guides, and projects. Through all of this they will obtain vital information on how to structure these assignments in ways that will effectively stimulate the students learning. With all the experience a teacher gains from having created so many projects before, they will be able to create an excellent summer project that will keep their students in good shape for their upcoming classes. Teachers are far better suited to creating summer assignments because of the need for authority in educational success. In all the aforementioned reasoning, one thing has remained clear, that teachers, the older and more experienced party, are unquestionably better suited to designing summer projects. Subordinate students will naturally create easy assignments that would minimize the required effort, especially since the project is to be completed over the summer break. Teachers; however, wouldn't necessarily create needlessly arduous projects, simply ones that would require the students to think on a high level. The necessity of an authority figure in education is paramount, and the importance of the teacher in designing summer projects is just an extension of that concept.",0,0.8393352031707764
"Ever since cell phones became popular in the late 1990's, in America, they have evolved from being simple mobile dialing and answering machines to basically mini computers that allow humans to now do a multitude of things like surf the internet and bank online to name a few. Unfortunately, in rent years humans have used cell phones to answer and receive calls, text and surf the Internet. As a result, cell phones have caused automobile accidents which have unfortunately led to deaths. In my opinion, drives should not be able to use cell phones if they are held in ones hand, however, they should be allowed to use cell phones in ""hands free"" mode as follows while operating a vehicle: 1. to talk and/or talk text via Bluetooth, 2. to use maps and/or a navigation system and 3. for entertainment purposes such as listening to music and the ability to watch movies, especially during cross county travel. Talking and texting while driving has become a ""hot topic"" in recent years mainly because of more and more humans using cell phones on a daily basis and the rise in traffic accidents due to talking and/or texting. I will agree that drivers can get distracted while talking on the cell phone while using their hands. I will also agree that drivers can get distracted by using their hands to text because the driver is constantly looking up and down which results in loss of concentration and attention to other drivers and to the road. However, a solution to the problem would be to mandate that all drives must use ""hands free"" mode via Bluetooth or you will be in violation of the law and can get a traffic ticket if seen using your hands. Before the cell phone, humans used actual paper maps to navigate the world. Until the early 2000's when cell phones came with satellite navigation via Goggle maps, software and apps such as MapQuest and Waze which allow the driver to get directions to their destinations via the cell phone. Navigation systems usually speak to the driver via the sound system in the vehicle which allow the driver to not use their hands. However, there are times that drivers use their hands to see the maps, therefore resulting in a traffic accidents. A solution to this issue would be to require all drivers to use the ""hands free"" mode while using navigation systems. The Internet has allowed for cell phones to have the ability to play radio stations from all over the country and not just local radio stations. The Internet has also allowed for humans to download their favorite music to their cell phones which they can then listen to the music via the phone. The Internet has also given humans the ability to watch television and movies via the cell phone by using apps such as YouTube and Netflix. Music has probably least likely to cause drivers to get distracted. However, movies have most likely caused traffic accidents because the driver looks up and down at the screen losing concentration while driving. A solution to this problem would be that the driver can only listen to music while driving and only the passengers can watch movies while the driver is driving, which are all ""hands free"" solutions. In conclusion, it is my opinion that drivers should be able to use cell phones in the capacity of ""hands free"" mode while operation a vehicle. The actual cell phone device is really not the issue that causes traffic accidents, it is basically the user lacking concentration, not paying attention and not using hands free mode that causes traffic accidents. Although humans will still get into traffic accidents while using ""hands free"" mode while operation a vehicle, it will most certainly cut down the number of accidents in the United States and around the world.",0,0.6207966804504395
"Author claim that people should study more about Venus by conduct a mission despite the risks. It may expand the very edges of imagination and innovation, and for human curiosity. However, the author makes a fabulous statements by explain the Venus, talk about the missions that scientists are seeking, and pursuade the readers. At first, in the beggining of the passage, he made a explanation of the Venus by comparing to the Earth. He first explain that Venus and Earth are similar in terms of density, size, and distance. Then he states that there are thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets in Venus, and their temperature and pressure is really high compared to Earth. This information that author gives us is great because readers can get backgroung information that can understand the missions and their risks that author will going to explain in the later passage. Second, he talks about the mission and their pros and cons. First, He says that NASA is seeking for sending humans to study Venus, but it has difficulities. However, author says that it's avoidable. For example, temperatures in Venus is very high, but their air pressure is close to that of sea level on Earth, so it's survivable for humans. This supports the idea clearly that readers can know it's possible to travel to Venus. Finally, author pursuades the readers. It's valuable to meet the challenge to send humans to Venus. Peering safely at Venus from ship can't collect anything. We need to conduct a mission to take samples of rock, gas, or anything else. As you can see, author is pursuading the readers that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. It seems it's not enough to pursuade the people and he can be more emotionally. Overall, his statement and how he supports that idea is really clear for the readers and it is settled. It own a risks, but conducting a mission to go to Venus is possible, and valuable for the humans.",0,0.8736963868141174
"Many of us are eager to become successful people. However, many successful people did not magically succeed one day. They all took a risk of being a failure or overcame the struggles. Therefore, I agree that successful people try new things and take risks. 

For example, Bill Gates, one of the most successful businessmen in the world, did not even graduate from the university. His great invention, Windows was nothing but a program with simple design at that time. His courage and plan, however, was not simple nor easy at all. As if he needed to prove that he is a talented businessman, he had to visit numerous numbers of people to pursuade them that his invention is amusing. 

Additionally, Bill Gates did not always succeed. His business went through several hard times. His business went through several trials because people were jealous of him all the time. Once, he had to leave the company for dominating the market. This is very absurd in my opinion because if running the business really well is a problematic, how come many people are trying so hard to become a successful business man? 

Gate's another great invention, XBOX, shows another example. At that time, the future of XBOX was very unclear. The market was already being dominated by SONY's Playstation II. Plus, if XBOX had failed to success in the market, that would have been another life time crisis for BIll Gates. Bill Gates took the risk of selling ungaurenteed product to the market and thanks to his idea, XBOX almost dominated the market in the North America. Now, consumers can enjoy different kinds of machines.

To conclude, successful people cannot success without taking a risk of being a failure. However, it is not the luck or fortune that makes the sucessful person. It is the courage and careful plan that creates one succesful person. Hardly anyone seems to realize this and often blame God for not having enough luck!",0,0.9127604365348816
"The driverless cars seem to be a big topic right now. They are yet another example of how our world is changing. 150 years ago we didn't even have cars, and now we have cars that almost drive themselves. This is a giant leap for us. It astonishes me to think that not that long ago people had to walk or ride a horse to get somewhere. This seems like the best invention ever, right? Like any new invention though, the driverless cars have their pros and cons. Driverless cars could change the world. There's so much having driverless cars could do for us. It would allow for a lot safer driving conditions. A majority of accidents are said to happen because of distractions, These distractions include things going on in the car, outside the car, and inside your head. Emotions tend to have a huge influence on how we drive. With driverless cars you eliminate a lot of the multitasking that goes along with attempting to drive and deal with these distractions. With driverless cars you would only have to grab the wheel and take over in complicated situations the car can't handle. The car would do most of the driving for you, which lessons the likely hood of you having an accident because of the distractions. Having driverless cars would give just about anyone the ability to drive. Driverless cars would allow for a lot easier way for transportation. You just hop in the car, program the gps, and hang on for the ride. With all these pros to having driverless cars people might not notice the cons of these cars. The driverless cars will eliminate a lot of accidents that occur everyday, but it could also give rise to a whole new set of issues. According to the article, ""safety is best achieved with alert drivers."" The article also tells us, ""traffic laws were written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times."" So when an accident occurs, who takes the blame? Is it the manufacturer who programmed the car? Or is it the driver who let the accident happen? After considering the pros and cons of this car it's easy for me to see that this car is a terrific idea. Yes, we are looking at a lot of issues with seeing who's at fault in the result of an accident. However, if we could work it out and develop some guidelines for who's at fault during an accident we'd be looking at one of the world's greatest inventions. In conclusion, I stand behind the driverless cars. I believe that the pros out weigh the cons in this situation. If we just figure out a system for deciding who's at fault in an accident, then we have a something could change the world of transportation.",0,0.7954545617103577

They also say in the differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to venus. Astronomers are facinated by venus because it may well once have been the most earth like planet in our solar system because long ago Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like the earth we live in now. also venus planets gots rocky sediment and includes familiar feature like mountains,craters and futhurmore.

"Dear TEACHER_NAME, I am a student at your school currently and I've noticed that many students do not do much community service. I myself do not do much either, but I think there are ways that you and other's in our school can help the community. I am not promoting that students have mandatory community service, I would just like it if you promote community service. What I am trying to get across is, have fundraiser's in school or allow speakers to come in to show what we can do. Many students believe that community service is a waste of their time. By forcing them to do community service, they will feel even less obliged to do so. Allowing kids to see what is going on in the world will allow them to think of how they can help. One example of promoting community service is having a public speaker come in. Someone who has worked to help the community already. Students will know that the person has done community service and knows what it's like. Students can relate to that person. Also, the person will persuade my fellow students to help the less fortunate or just the community. Another example of promoting community service would be having fundraiser's in school. Gathering can's food for those who don't have any. Go to a nearby shelter and entertain the people there whom are less fortunate. If you do these things, or things along these lines I can guarantee that more students will be participating in community activities. As I said earlier, many students believe community service is a waste of time. Most of those students spend their weekends sitting in front of a television screen. I admit that I do that to over some weekends, but showing kids that they can make a difference will give them the ability to get off the couch and go help the community. There will be a significantly larger amount of kids that help the community. Though it may not be a significant amount of help, it's better than no help. These are my views on how we should deal with students and community service. I hope you at least take them into consideration. Promoting community service will be very helpful, and it can also help students get into better schools in the future. Sincerely, Student",0,0.731370210647583
"Nowadays, a lot of businesses are growing and developing. As far as business is concerned, people who have started a new business want to succeed. In my opinion, the people who want to earn a lot of money have to try new things because of following reasons.

 First of all, if one has a new idea, it would provide people interested. The most important thing of success in business or earning a lot of money begins with people's interests. People do not interest what they already know. In contrast, upon seeing a new thing, they interest about the thing and buy it. Thus, an interesting idea or new thing which are never known to people could succeed one's business

 Second and last, the world is changing rapidly and variety. One who knows how to do well and does the same thing, he/she is never  going to be succeeded because the world is moving fast and requires new thing everyday. For example, one of the camera company 'Canon' has changed new way on digital camera. The cameras of Canon has 'CMOS' censor which is the heart of camera and in the past, 'CMOS' is the worst and cheapest chip. Canon, however, has developed this censor new way that is totally different way than before. 'Nikon', one of the rival company of Canon, was tha best of camera in the film area. In contrast, Nikon uses 'CCD' which is sharper than CMOS but expensive. The censor has given from 'Sony', hence, it is expensive and it is not their own technology. Through Canon's new trying and developing its new censor become the best camera in the digital camera. In the past, film is the only method of taking picture, however, the world photography market has changed by digital and Canon tried a new technology and finally succeed. 

 In conclusion, the world needs new things and people need new things as well. Therefore, if one wants to succeed, I would suggest two things. Be a creative to make a new idea and try a new way to succeed.",0,0.879878044128418
"People say that the face figure on mars is made by aliens. That hypothosis is not true because aliens do not excist. This figure on mars can be made by a human or it can be made by natural causes on the planet. as you can see in the pictures the face in 1976 it is full and the one in the second picture is half way gone the third picture it is almost completetly gone. if this figure is made by humans it did not last very long. If this figure is mad eby natural causes on the planet it has faded away over the years. Most people around the world think this figure is made by aliens, This figure could have been made by the astronauts on the ships and they just made a figure and took a picture of it and made people think that it was made by aliens. This figure could have been made not even on the planet they could have took some clay or some other material and made a rock like face and said that they found it on the planet. This figure is probably a fake because how often do you go to a planet and just find a random rock that looks like a face. If this figure is real then they need to take another picture and put it up. If they do take another picture it has to have the shuttle to where you can see it so the people around the world can say it is in space. If there really is a face figure on that planet that might be a sign of life on the planet. Maybe the astronauts have found another planet with life it may not be human it may be im not saying that aliens are real but if there is life on that planet this whole world will be wanting to go up there and see for themselves. If there is life on that planet then people will pay big money to go up,also if theres life maybe we will go back up there and their might be another face figure.

"Dear TEACHER_NAME, There are many pros and cons to requiring students to do community service. Some parents might not agree with it so you might want to talk to them about it first to give your opinion and to tell them a little more about what's going on. When you're talking to the parents, you should keep in mind that there are many pros and cons to requiring students to do community service. The cons of requiring students to do community work is plentiful even if there are pros to counteract it. One of the cons is that even if the students are required to do it, it might not teach them anything or help anyone in the process. For example, they might try to help people but they don't want to do it and that shows and changes how everything works out. It might be helpful but they won't be taught responsibility because if they don't care about it, they don't want to learn anything about it, I know this from my own experience. Another con is that if they don't care about it, they more than likely won't do a good job on it. They're lacking of the ability to want to do it, and to enjoy it, and to actually try. If they don't want to, like most of them don't because if they wanted to they would have volunteered by now, they won't try and they won't care how it turns out. They don't care how it's affecting things or what the consequences might be. Another con is that most of them would have to give up some sports, or there homework time, or even their free time which I know most of them wouldn't be very happy about. Another con is parents, some parents are over-protective and don't want their children doing stuff like that, some parents don't want their kids to help other kids, and other parents might not want their children doing that work. So, there is a good amount of cons we would have to pay attention to and give it some thought. Now we have the pros, which are also plentiful. One pro to having students being required to do community service is that it might teach them responsibility. If they do it and start to care about what they're doing to help people and their world (ecosystem) then it would get them to keep doing that and have other people try it. Plus if they do that, it teaches them more responsibility. For example, if they're picking up trash, they will realize all the work they have to do and that might change something in their brain and think that they shouldn't litter not only because it's bad for the environment but also because there is a certain amount of work involved to pick all of it up and keep it maintained. Another thing is that it can keep them active. If they're helping outside or working hard, it keeps them active. Obesity is a growing problem in our world and to keep kids active would be very helpful. For example, if they're outside picking up trash, they are walking around and not staying inside watching television or texting or playing video games. They're actually out and about and that not only would help our obesity problem but also help make our world green and bountiful. So, there are all the pros, and there's probably more that we can tell the parents to make them understand and maybe get them to agree with us to make our world a better place. If you can't already tell, I am mutual on this, I think it's a good idea but I know there will be some problems. I think you should suggest it to the kids and see what they think. After all, we'll be taking over soon, it's our generation's time to shine. Let's make this world a place to remember, and to remember that we helped make it this way. sincerely, STUDENT_NAME",0,0.8228291273117065
"Driving Phone usage while driving is outlawed in the United States. Using your phone while driving can be very detrimental to the driver and drivers around them. Taking your eyes off the road to use your phone can lead to severe crashes, and deaths of others. Texting your friends while behind the wheel can lead to you totaling your car or worse. In additional to voice calling, activities such as web browsing, playing video games, or phone use in general can also increase the risk of a crash."" According to national safety council, 1.2 million car crashes in 2013 involve divers talking on the and at least phone 341,000 involved in text messaging"". Divers are constantly reminded not to use their phone while driving but most people do it anyway for the matter of not caring for their safety. Driving requires a lot of focus and full attention. Distracted driving affects all drivers from time to time but can come with stiff consequences. Unfocused or distracted driving does not affect all drivers the same. Some frequently and to greater magnitudes pay less attention to the road, increasing their risk for disaster. However, it is important to note that it takes one time and perhaps the smallest of distractions to cause an accident. Although using your phone while driving can be deadly it can be useful. Using your phone to navigate can be very useful and find directions. It can also be used to play music and keep you entertained while driving. While these can be positive usage of your phone it can still be very negative.

"Cell phones or Not I think that you should let students have their cell phones to school and let them use them during free time and lunch periods. My first reason is if students are do with all their work they should be able to text because if we don't let them they are going to be talking to other people and disturbing the people that are still trying to work, so when we let them they wont disturb the their other classmates. They will also get into less trouble when they don't have anything to do. Normally they the people that get into trouble in the class room is people that have nothing to do. We can decrease that number by letting them text. Also when we do this less people in the office, more time for the secretaries to do what they need to do.

"Its true that young peole do not give much time in helping their communities.In my opinion the author's statement is true.
and there are many a reasons associated 
Now a days young people are held up with lot more responsibilities pertaining to many aspects.some need to look after their family,their elders for this reason few youngsters have to attend a job in order to receive certain payment.
While these group of youngsters are busy working with the welfare of the family few other youngsters indulge themselves in planning about their future and career.I a hurry to catch up todays world's pace young people hardly find any time to think about helping the community.
people generally think that spending their time in helping out their communities is a mere waste as they dont fetch them anything in their lives. they feel that instead of wasting their valuable time in helping out their communities they could better think about thier own future,they use their time and talent in designing their own future.
For the young people to think something about their communiuties they should need some back up or rather some amount of encouragemant through their elders or teachers or friends.in this busy world people rarely think about encouraging someone in something as every one is busy building their own future.
Man these days tend to act selfish as he doesnt recieve any correct reward for what he has done.when there is no one to recognise the part of work an individual has done in turning out his community the man lacks entusiasm in taking part in changing the shape of the community ther after.

"If you were making one of the most important choices of your life wouldnt you want to make the right one? That is why it is good to hear lots of people advice because some people could give great advice but others could give awful advice. People's opinions could make a tremendous impact on the advice that they give you. If someone has a very strong opinion it could be bias but if someone has a very weak opinion they likely dont care about that subject. Someone could have a bad history with the topic of advice or just not care so they could have a very bad opinion because they dont like talking about the topic or just dont like the topic. Lastly people could just flat out lie to you in theyre opinion and that could end up causing you to potentially make the wrong choice. A another thing that could have a huge impact on the advice that people give you is whether or not they have experience in the topic. If someone is very experienced in the topic that person would likely give you great advice but if someone isnt experienced and is just giving you random advice that could cause you to make the wrong decision. People could have had a great experience with the topic which could cause them to give you a biased answer of whether or not they likes the experience they had with the topic. The same thing goes for if someone were to have a very poor experience it could cause bias. Finally people could just flat out lie to you about theyre experience with the topic, they could call themselves and expert but in reality they could be completely clueless and giving you horrible advice. Lastly people could just be bad advice givers, they could have good things to tell you but not know how to explain it or tell you about it. You need lots of advice from lots of different people in order for you to just get some good advice from people. If someone does not like you they could purposely give you bad advice which could potentially ruin your life.

"My position on driverless cars is not approved. If the car is called ""driverless"" why would you still need a human in the car to be ready and alerted if an he/she had to take action in a serious situation. ""Designed to notify the driver wjhen the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" Since the car is a driverless car why would a driver still need to be ready and alerted when the car cant manage to handle something. As in paragraph 7 it states ""all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" Well if thats the case then why call it a driverless car if you still need to be alerted. That would also mean that the driver is not allowed to slack off and that the rules before the human got that car will still applie. Both eyes on the road at all times and both hands on the wheel at all times. It would cost so much money to build new roads for the cars because in oder for the cars to drive and move in perfect condition is to have sensors that can read the positive and the negative polarity as messages in the binary code. As said in paragrahp 3 ""they required massive upgrades to exsiting roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical."" To much constuction would be happening at one time. When the option of smarter roads was crossed of the list, a new option came metioning smarter cars. ""They needed a whole lot more sensors."" That seemslike a great idea but what if a human drvies on to many bumps and a sensor breaks off? Who knows how much it cost to fix it or where you can even find another sensor to replace the one that broke. A sensor can miscalculate a turn or and turn another way and cause a crash only because one or more sensors miscalulated. Another thing about the sensors. what about the winter time? What if the sensors freeze or just get snow on them are the sensors water proof? So that would also put the human thats behind the wheel in a huge risk of being injured. The sensors could not pick up any positive or negative messages it need to read the binary code. Think about if all electricy just cut off in a specific area. Wouldnt those sensors need the electircity to read the binary code? Wouldnt the sensors need to read the positive and negative messages also? If there was an power outage then no human would getting bakc to there destination or home. Floods can be a thing that the sensors could get a shortage from. When its constantly raining and the water is rising faster by the minute and the car is driving through all of it while its splashing uner the car the sensors could definitly messed up.",0,0.8807439804077148
"I would like to state something first, the Face was not created by aliens. I will show you and prove you wrong. It is a natural landform! One of the reasons why it is was not made by aliens is because it was a ""huge rock formation"" that was accidently discovered by Viking 1. It was accidently discovered because Viking 1 was looking for landing spots for its sister ship Viking 2. The second reason why it was not created by aliens is because its a natural landform. It's a natural landform because, ""when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Micheal Malin and his Mars Oribter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the one shot in 1976 original Viking photos. Thousands of people on the internet waited when the first picture appeared on JPL web site, revealing a natural landform."" So from this short passage you can see that it was after all not at all that aliens created the Face but a normal common rock formation that miraculously appeared to be the face of a human. In conclusion, the Face was never made by aliens but by the planet itself. So if you think that aliens made this than you are wrong because there is no martian life on Mars.

Frist the author explans how the Earth and Venus are sister plans, saconed that author shares how Venus is also much differnt than Earth, and lastedly the author tells us how Sicentests are still working on how to land on Venus. Frist the author explans how the to plants are sister to each other like how Earth and Venus are the same size and density. The aurth also shares that the two are neighbor plants. By te aurth comparing these to he is stating that do to thes thing Venus is one of the plants that is more like Earth. Do to Earth and Venus haveing their simalerates thay also have ther differectsis. Sacandly Venus is different from Earth by Venus having a thick atmosphere and it being made by carbon dioxide it not realy Earth like. There are also many other differect like how hot it is there on the surface of the plant it gets over 800 degrees and thats realy to hot for humans. By these condions its hard for Sicenatis to get to Venus. Lastedly if Sicenatis like NASA's want to get to Venus they would have to get thought these tuff problems they would hve to faces. Like NASA's would need to make ther rockiet more use to Venus's inviernment. also they would have to figer out how would there pasingers be able to serve in 800 degree weather. Do to these problems we still have alot to learn about Venus and how to get there. Even thouth it shounds difitclud we can still learn more if we can get there.

"Humans are so diverse. Some may be similar, but none are the exact same. Students are no different, even though they may be learning the same information, the way students understand and learn that information can be vastly different. Teachers help students learn materials through a variety of methods, like projects and tests. Schools that require students to complete summer projects should make the projects student designed, proving that there are many different ways of learning. Depending on the student, some methods of learning are incredibly more beneficial than others. When I learned vital concepts such as multiplication, the way my teacher taught was through constant out loud repetition of the material, which helped my classmates along, but not me. I needed to see the problem worked out and look at the numbers because I had trouble picturing all the math and numbers in my head. Not being able to understand that basic concept of multiplication was detrimental to my math abilities and led the following years of my math career to be absolutely exhausting. This same scenario could take place involving summer projects. A teacher could give a student a summer assignment to help them learn about a concept in that class, but if the design of the assignment was difficult for the student to understand, it could be more hurtful than helpful. The entire reason teachers and schools assign projects over the summer is to assure that students will continue to learn during their break, but how are the students supposed to learn if they can't understand or have trouble with the assignment? Projects are meant to provoke students to think, and having students design the project themselves is a great way for them to think more and therefore learn more. If students designed a summer project, they would have to think about what to do since they most likely won't have as many guidelines that a teacher typically would give. This allows students the opportunity to be creative and think outside the box. Students could then potentially learn a lot about themselves and not just whatever the subject of the project is. If the student creates the project themselves, it seems more likely that they would actually enjoy the project. And if they enjoyed doing the project, they will remember it more. I don't remember the material from my psychology summer assignment this year. All we had to do was research and write about a basic concept from psychology. I do, however, remember the Latin project I did in seventh grade. I think this is because I was allowed to do the project on anything related to Latin that I wanted. All my teacher asked of us was that the project was somehow Latin related. I decided to do my project on ancient roman customs, specifically the different rituals performed as a person reaches certain ages. From that project I remember things like that at six months old a young roman boy gets a round pendant called a bulla to protect them from evil spirits and when they reach age twelve the receive a new type of toga and more. I could not tell you about the five methods of observation used in psychology, which is what my summer assignment this year (11th grade) was about. Some may argue that having students design summer projects is a bad idea because the typical student is lazy and will make an easy project design so that they won't have to actually learn anything. If this is true, having a teacher designed project does not change that situation. The reality is that if a student is lazy and doesn't want to learn, they will not learn. For my psychology summer assignment, I was lazy during the summer and did not want to do it, but eventually I did it the day before they school year started and learned nothing because it was boring and I wanted to get it over with. However, if the assignment was to research anything I wanted about psychology, perhaps it could have turned out like my 7th grade Latin assignment and I would've actually learned something. From personal experience I can say that the best way to combat an apathetic student is to gain their interest somehow, which could be done by allowing them the freedom to design their own project. For example, I loved reading Frankenstein in English, but after having to write so much about it I no longer like it and don't really remember much of what happened. Even if a subject is interesting, the desire to do a project on it can be crushed by the formatting of the project. Allowing students to do whatever format they want could make students gain interest and want to learn more about a subject compared to doing something they don't want, like writing an essay, which may make them harbor resentment toward the subject instead. If a school decides to assign a summer project, the students should be the ones to design them, which shows that there are many ways people learn. By understanding that some children need to be taught in different ways, people can better educate the youth of America. Improving the way the people are educated can give society more informed citizens who are confident in their abilities and work better and smarter.",0,0.8325762748718262
"Do you think driverless are a thing of the future or just plain science fiction? I think that they are a thing of the furure. They can get great gas miles, are completely useful, and they are almost completely accadent free. Driverless cars can get way better gas miles becuse they run off of computers and can tell what way is the best course. The author says in the passage that ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis,"". As time passes we get smarter and can create a more fuel efficant car the can become the first driverless car. These cars are already being used and have features to make sure the driver is aware when condions are bad and when there is traffic it can help. In the passage it says that "" In 2013, BMW announced the development of 'Traffic Jam Assistant.' The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" This shows how close we are to having completely driverless cars. These cars will need a whole lot of sensors to be completely driverless but they all will eventualy be completely accident free. the author stats that, ""Further improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own."" In the future the cars will be completely accident free and safer to drive. Driverless cars will be a thing of the future and everyone will have one and be completely safe.

"The mans need for decrease in time for travelling has resulted in increased number of  vehicals . The most common means of transport is through public . But, with growing needs of man this is not the case . Man has started to buy his own vehicals mostly cars as they provide a convenient mode of transportation . The one of the reasons behind this is that a car provides a perfect mode of transportation for the whole family . The car is more benificial as it provides a lot of space sit  and provides a lot of space to carry things that are required to make a perfect holiday .  this is unlike public transportation were you will have to carry your own luggage where ever you go  thus , leaving your belongings to their own fate .

                             There is an increase in number of cars used now a days . As they  not only provide total satisfaction but also provide an image in the society . Today we distinguish  people  by their clothing , their social behaviour and their social status . Thus, in a race to prove their social status  men have bought cars and bikes that are real expensive . Not only that the modern day youth is obssesed by the fastest cars available thus leading to increase in motor sports like formula 1 and etc .

Have made the youth crazy them . unlike the past there are a lot of companies that offer quality products thus insearch of a good marketing stratagie these motor vehicals were made more technically equiped . Thus leading to technical advancements where one could automat his vehical to reach his destination , he could find which hotel  is nearby and can even access internet and could see where he is . This is made possible through satellite communication known as gps .  thus all these advancements in technologies would lure even a common man to buy a car rather than travelling through public transportation .

"Facial codeing is it useful? Technology is it really advanced enough to know whether or not someone is happy? Is the way we are suppose to look when angry the way to judge somebody, what if it's there natural face? would somebody take offense if they drew a drawling that was suppose to be happy but the computer said it was only 64 percent happy?i know i would now let me tell you what i think. Technology is really cool don't get me wrong i think technology is the greatest invention in this world. But i believe we all know the fact that technology can get really expensive and for really stupid reasons So, i am going against this and here's why. How this works is the computer takes a face into a 3-D model and there are suppose to be 44 muscles that move. In paragraph three there's is a part that says ""For example, your frontails pars lateralis muscle (above your eye) raises your eyebrows when you're surprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger"". Now your probably saying ok why are you against it, because not everyones eybrows move when they're surprised. Personally my eyebrows also move when im really tired, nervouse buzzed out on nicotine or simply when i have the jitter bugs becaus im scared and shaking. ""she's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disguisted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"". This is where the role play of me not aggree with this comes in, i honestly feel like the computer is throwing numbers at you we cant be accurate. and even if we were there doing this on scientifically how the muscle should look which is a lot of bull crap to me. ""Yet Dr. Huang observes that artist such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions"". So, right there we can see yeah he may be able to get pretty damn close but im sorry da Vinci just being close isn't enough for me you would have to be right on the dot. I get it's not going to be a perfect 100 pecent happy but how do we know it's 83 percent. Why cant't it be a 73 percent or a 65 yeah i get all of there percents add up to 100% but how do we not know the computer is just not being lazy and picking the easiest numbers to add. For examp they could do 75 percent happy, 12 percent disgusted, 10 percetn fearful and 3 percent that's how i see mona lisa in the picture. or it could even be something along the lines of 75 percent happy, 12 percent disgusted, 6 percent angry, and then 7 percent angry. I dont know if any of this made my point come across but here's my point. everyone will look at this picture or anyother picture and everyone will think differently of it you wont have a right or wrong answer. just like everyone will have a right or wrong answer about this form of technology. we could look at grandpa joe and say damn he looks very upset and angry he doesnt want to be here. but maybe in all reality thats just his face. Grandpa could be happier then you although you probably arn't happy grading all of these test. So, my final answer is im against this technology i think it would be a waste of money thank you.",0,0.8039690256118774
"It is more important to understand the ideas and concept than to learn facts because if one is not clear with the idea, one can not get the details of facts. 
                               Understanding ideas can be related to history or and event. Lets say you are asked to write a detail about your country, for example India. You will be able to see the present situation that it is an Independent country which is the fact but what were the consequences  it underwent at the time when British people ruled the country and how did the the freedom fighters gave up their lives for the  independence of the  country cant be achieved. so it becomes necessary to understand both facts as well as idea behind it. 
		If one is watching a painting, one wont be able to make out the idea behind that painting but as the matter of fact he will picture it according to his own point of view. It might be that for a painter it is a painting of his family and he s expressing his views in that painting but  for the viewer it might just be number of people standing. But if the student is provided with the ideas and facts together than a student will learn as well as understand the concept behind  it . 
		i once experienced that one of my frind told me that my best friend is just using me for some work to be done and i started hating her for that because that was the idea i got from the information but i could have spoke to her and understood the facts behind. Just by not being aware of the facts i almost ruined my relation. so at times it become necessary to understand the whole thing than to just go with the idea.

"The engineers who presented this more refined idea of a car that does not need a driverbecame the pioneers of this technological evolution and self-driven car laboratories sprung up around the united states of america. The most obvius benefit of having a driverless car is the fact that people do not have to drive it most of the time. Also due to the fact that it is a hands free type of thing, drivers have more freedom to do whatever they want while inside the car including reading, texting, eating, and so on. the main issue with having a progam do all of the work for us is that there is less interacttion between people. There is already a huge dilema with people being outgoingbecause of social media;now people can ignore eachother while in there cars too? The concept of a car that does not need a driver may seem futuristic to most people, but that concept has become one of Google's most popular innovations aside from their universally-known search egine. The idea of a self-driving vehicle is very appealing to many people, but in reality 'driverless is really driver optional'.

"Do you ever sit in class so confused that you don't even know what you are doing? Well now we have a technology that could read your expressions and put everything into perspective for you.

"Phones & driving Driving and texting is an effective way of communication, using cell phones while driving is a bad distraction on the road and it takes drivers attention off the road, increasing road safety is a great concern for the community. Texting and driving is very dangerous cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year and 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by driving and texting almost every accident in the world happens from texting while driving. There are three types of distractions while driving and they are manual, cognitive, and visual. Manual distractions is when the drivers hands is taken off the wheel in front of them and cause them to pay more attention to text message then the steering wheel. The next one is cognitive, cognitive redirects a driver's focus onto the conversation they are in and taking your mind off driving. After that the next one is visual this is different from the two because visual is the most important if your eyes goes off the road you automatically lose focus of the road ahead. Now the only way to prevent all of these things from happening is to make texting while driving illegal. Drivers should not have their phone in their hand while driving it should be placed on a phone holder and phone should be connected to the car bluetooth so that everybody on the road is safe and no ones lives will be in danger. Police are cracking down on texting and driving because the generation now doesn't know how to keep their phones out of their hands. Driving is a serious matter and our attention should be given 100% while driving, this is basically the same as basically the same as drinking and driving. Many consequences can occur from texting/drinking and driving. tickets, fines, accidents, and possibly death can be caused by these unreasonable actions.

"ARE WE HUMAN OR MACHINES?

Society has been developing in many different ways according to human necesseties. This human vision has gone dissapeard.
Actually we move in a very high stressed world, (obviously, in developed countries), that sometimes does not allow to people to increase their human values and their helping in their communities.

Probably, many years ago, young people did not used to do such things that young people, at this moment do. We had more relathionships each other's and also we had more dependence on the rest of the people. Industrialisation, technical developments, new discovers, independence, competition,stress... have really made changing  the world.

Firstly, parents want to give to their children all they hadn't when they were childs, and in many cases they are making a mistake, and in this way young people can't think in things' values and the cost of them.

Secondly, sometimes children schedule is like a minister schedule. I mean, it seems that they have to full all their time in the whole day, going school, learning music, learning, sports, languages, and many other things that you could imagine. After that, they arrive at home totally exhausted, so they don't have the strong enough to spend another part of their time helping their communities. At least, this is what is happening in medium class family in Spain, the place where I live .

Thirdly, they have a great adversary, TELEVISION!!! Oh my God!! I think it is the principal and horrible nowadays' enemy of our young people, they coul spend all theri time watching it.

Finally, I must say that we coul try to avoid many things and to be more creative with our children, and incentivate them to value human relathionships, only in this way they could probably help their communities.",0,0.8960612416267395
I think driverless cars are the future is amazing its like a hi-tech cruze mode the first ever driverless car mode but its so much has been added since 2004 I believed. Its so many different things now on a car like self parking when the car park for you. Camera on your blind side and in the rear etc. I like the idea of driverless cars technolgy is so amazing by 2020 technolgy will change in many ways not just with cars with everything thats run on electricity. Driverless cars will be the next big things and also will be the most expensive things to buy. I hope these cars work on solar power or plug in. lets get these cars to be the best things for humans and earth. But I also think these cars can be dangerous. There are many ways this car can be dangerous first off if you ever go on a road trip and driving somewhere with manys hours and you a person that like to go all the way threw this car might and might not be best for you if you tend to fall alseep. Will the car still drive or will it stop and leave you in the middle of no where? You would hope it keep going but I got a feelings its not cause of the sensoring. The vibarting seat is a bad idea if you in a deep sleep and some thing giving you a maasage your not going wake up they should blast the radio all the way up. But if the car do drive for you while you fall alseep then it should drive very slow i say 20 Mph. But if the car breaks will it stop and keep going or would it just leave you there. The driverless cars do have some pro's and con's to it If I was older enough to get a car and be able to drive i would buy this car who doesn't want to be apart of something so big i will invest money into somethhing like this. These cars will help so much bring down accident and deaths rate. The driverless car should know what the speed zone is an let you go 10 Mph over it.But this car is the next big thing evryone will have them and there will be some rare manual cars by the year 2075.,0,0.82763671875

Dear Principle. I think having the phone on free time is better then no phones at all because what if there is something wrong with someone in your family and you want to call your family and check on that person who is either sick or has a broken bone. Also what if there is an emergency and your parent's have called u when your phone was off and left u a voice message and u got it when u turned your phone on and said someone in your family is either hert or died and they wanted to tell you as soon as posable so they don't want u mad at then when u get home because they didn't tell you or picked u up from school. Another thing would be if u have an dentist appointment or and doctor appointment and your parents need to tell u they are going to pick you up from school early. Another reason why i think we should have phones on our free time in school is what if your parents didn't want to call the school and have like the principle or the office secretaries tell you because maybe it was something that no body needed to know about but you and your family.,0,0.8989958763122559
"If you ask a student what their favorite season is, chances are they are going to say summer. Summer to children is a time of relaxation and stress-relief from their ten hardworking months of schooling. However, schools often times leave them a project to accomplish over the summer to keep the subjects learned in their mind over the summer. It is for that goal I say that those summer projects should be teacher-designed projects, as opposed to student-designed projects, because teacher-designed projects are better organized, are time-managment friendly, and are easier on the teachers when grading. When you compare teacher-designed projects to student-designed projects, often times you find the teacher-designed ones to be the better organized. That is due to their adult sense as opposed to a child designed ones. It is pretty obvious if you think about it. Who would you expect to have a cleaner backpack, an adult or a kid? 99% of the time it's going to be the adult. Another reason to this argument is that when a teacher designs the project, It is simple, and it has a rubric, to help clear confusion and what it takes to get the best grade possible. If a child were to design that same thing, going back to when we said an adult organization skills are better than a child, that it will not be as clear and straight forward as a teachers (another reason we will get to soon) because the assortment of ideas behind the project will not be as straight forward and will be more confusing to the grader, leaving you off with a worst grade. With those ideas taken in mind, It appears pretty obvious that the student-designed are not as organized as a teacher Although adults struggle with the same issue also, I would say all have better time managment skills than a child. That is a main reason why teachers should design projects and not students. Teachers would be able to set specific marks on their project so students don't get stressed out about how to do a huge project spaced out over a very long period of time. When teachers set specific due dates on a project, students tend to get better grades due to this facts. Keeping these issues in mind, summer is a time for relaxation and stress relief, so why shouldn't the students be able to do their projects at their own pace and not be forced to do a project that makes them feel like they are back in school. For that, I say the teacher can also set the due dates to make sure you remember the topics you learned over the summer in a way that a student-designed project cannot simply because of the teachers expertise because she is a teacher that went to school to become a teacher. These reasons taken into account, it's not hard to see that teacher-designed projects are more time-managment friendly than student-designed ones. The most essential point and the whole purpose of the project is the grading, which, with a teacher-designed project, is easier on the teacher than a student-designed one. One of the key factors to this is that a teacher CAN have a set rubric to her own project, which will make grading go by easier and more accurately. Opposing this, when the project is student-designed, there will be multiple projects, forcing the teacher to spend more time grading them and not as efficiently. With this idea being kept in mind, the more efficient and faster way to grade projects is to have them be teacher-designed as opposed to student-design. All these topics being brought together, and it shows that the most beneficial way for both teacher and student on a summer project, is to have it be teacher-designed. That way, the student is still feeling stress free, from summer, going into the school year because they have done a better job on that summer project and not fearing getting a scolding from their parents for getting a bad grade for some reason they cannot control, for they are just a child.",0,0.876117467880249
"Many consider traveling to be one of the fundemantel value to develop your point of view in to the world. Traviling alone sometimes can be hard  for people. On my part, I agree that travelling with a tour guide has more benefits than travelling individually. With a tour guide, youn can safe time and recieve more information. On the other hand, traveling without a tour guide gives you freedom.

First, safing time is really important when you are on the trip. By a tour giude, you can schedule your time. For example, in  trips, there are some schedules which offer a lot of place to visit  for visitors. In this schedule with a tour guide visitors can see many places in one day. They have a chance to visit many places and see on

In addition, when people travel to somewhere, they would like to learn some information about the place. With a tour guide, receiving information is easy for visitors. For example, in foreign countries visitors have to translate some information which is about the place. people do not have a chance to translate all foreign languages. A tour guide can translate the information for visitors.

Hovewer, Depending on someone sometimes feels visitors boring.When people travel to some places, they sometimes want to feel free. Without a tour guide, they can do whatever they want. For example, they can go shoping, visiting some places, eating their launch or dinner whenever they want. 

To sum up, travelling with a tour guide offers many advantages for visitors. Saving time and getting information are really significant things to travel.",0,0.7923799157142639
using facial expresions are a good way to tell someone u are mad or happy. but sometimes u cant tell the diffrence unless people smile all the time. for instince when i walk i have a mean face that dosent mean im mad i could be happy but its just how my face is. u shouldnt need technology to tell someone if your happy ot sad all they gotta do is look at your face and they should already know if your mad or sad. if the person isnt sure they should ask and see wether if your mad or sad. mona lisa smiling is just showing that shes happy or that she was happy while taking the picture. to be honest i think u can smile and feel something other than happiness. like when someone is mad and they smile just to seem like there happy. i really dont get how u can calculate emotions like its an emoiton not a math question u either ask if the person is mad or sad or u just guess off the facial expressions. thats how i see it in my eyes itll be much easier to just ask then to do reasurch. i think the smile should be used to show happiness people can be happy for just a moment then change there face which i understand i do it all the time. mad face should show if your mad. sad face should show that your sad. it shouldnt have to involve technology to find out how the person feels. mona lisa is a wonderful painting but i think she was happy in the picture because she smiled.,0,0.7890316247940063

"I agree this statement, ""it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.
 I've been going to school for 12 years.I am a high school student.  I learn many things at school. My favorite class is English class which i think is the most important subject we have to learn. In English class, we read some books and discuss what the book tells us. When we discuss about the books, everybody has different opinion and it is stimulating to know what other people say and figure out what the author is trying to say. There are too many messages in books for a person to understand by oneself. I think we need to discuss with many people who are smarter and have different ideas. The books don't tell us facts. They tell us ideas and concepts. That's why we need to get together and find those ideas and concepts. Those ideas and concepts are only clear to the author who writes the book. The author tries to tell other people his ideas and concepts by writing books, but it is impossible for him to perfectly tell them. This is the reason we keep studying ideas and concepts, and i think it is important for us to understand them.
 I think ideas and concepts are more important than facts. Facts are like the things we learn in physics, chemistry or math. We need to know all those facts to be investors or some scientists, but i don't think learning facts is the main purpose of education. I always have a special feeling for being a human, because we can not only know the facts, but also creats ideas and concepts. Other animals can not do that. I think to understand ideas and concepts make us more cultivated and better in many ways. Facts let us know what is going in the world we see, and ideas and concepts let us know what is going on in our mind.
 I think it is more important to understand ideas and concepts because they have deeper meanings and they will make us better people. I believe that's we have to do throughout",0,0.7930809259414673
"We use them everyday, they get us to our destinations, but what would life be without them? What benefits could arise from limiting the usage of cars? According to source 1, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" source 2, ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" source 3, ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" and source 4, ""The End of Car Culture,"" limiting the usage of cars has gained advantages towards traffic, pollution, and the overall community to better benefit the environment. In source 1, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" residents of the ""upscale community"" of Vauban, Germany, have become ""suburban pioneers"" and ""have given up their cars."" Although in many cities around the world it is unimaginable to give up your cars, it has become increasingly beneficial towards the environment and community. It is said to be ""a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes,"" as cars are responsible for ""12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" Planners are now taking the concept to ""suburbs"" where ""stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highways,"" thus making the car-banning residential friendly, and environmentally helpful. Not only will the limiting usage of cars be beneficial towards the community, it will also be beneficial towards your mental health as said by Heidrun Walter who stated ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" In source 2, ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" residents of Paris are also seeing increasing advantages ""after days of near-record pollution"" when Paris ""enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" within ""five-days of intensifying smog,"" ""congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France."" If five-days can have a significant beneficial impact, imagine what a month can do, or a year, or even a decade towards the restoration of the environment. Similar to the previous cities in the sources mentioned, Bogota also participates in a ""car-free day"" as stated in source 3, ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" where ""millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work,"" ""leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" In this ""Day Without Cars"" campaign, ""the goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog,"" and its goal is being reached. By banning the usage of cars ""it's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaze. Along with many other advantages such as the ""blooming"" of ""parks and sports centers"" ""throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up,"" as stated in the article. Last but not least, in source 4, ""The End of Car Culture,"" ""recent studies"" have shown that ""Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by,"" and ""if this pattern persists... it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment."" With a decreasing amount of citizens driving, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, has ""led out a buisness plan"" that will ""create cities in which pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" The decreased usage of cars will have an everlasting positive impact on the environment. In conclusion, although living in a world free of cars is a world many of us can never dream of, it has shown to lead to significant advantages towards traffic, pollution, and the overall community, which can be seen in the cities; Vauban, Germany, Paris, France, Bogota, Columbia and the United States -- as stated in the sources ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" and ""The End of Car Culture.""

"The our social life is changing fater than ever before .
in this society we always using cars for our living.
the cars have  the mportant part of our living.

In my opinion, I disagree with the statement.
this is because the cars are the definition of the modern transportation, 
the first reason is that ,for example, in my case I usually used the car when I went to the supermarket and school. this is because the cars are the most comfortable to me,it is not for me , everybody feel these comfortable,
 
but we think about the aspect of the envirometal.
I worried about the air pollution, the air polution often can be acontroversial issue .
however we dont have to do this worry about that, 
the other resources from nature are developing in thesedays .
so we will can ride a car that derives from energy of sun.

and the final reason is that the money for the cars is the less than other transportations.
for instans ,nowadays, the price of fuel is going down. 
for in my case, my car is small, so it  need less fuel than other big cars,and than I don't need to waste my money,
we often take airplanes . the air planes fee is largly waste my money.",0,0.850220263004303
"In 1976, a Mars Global Surveyor snapped pictures of what is known as the ""Face on Mars."" It is a natural landformation and is visible becuase of the pictures shown, the internet, and the area the landform is located. First, the pictures show the ""face."" In 1976, the pixels were 43m (meters) per pixel. In 2001, the pixels were only 1.56m per pixel. The quality is worse the bigger the pixels. In 2001, the quality of the pixels were clear enough to show that the ""face"" was only a lanform. In the picture of 1976, it is visible that the picture is blurry. In the picture of 1998, the picture is less blurry, but still hard to see. In the 2001 picturer, the picture is very visible and well seen. At the bottom of the mesa, it is also visible to see the lanform has a rounded, smooth, almost non man-made surface that buried the landform into the planet side. Next, the Internet, showed what the scientists and the picters showed. A landform. In the text, it states that when the picture was taken in 1998, it was the cloudy time of theyear on the red planet. Finally, where the ""face"" is located. The face is located in a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. In the article, it states that ""The sensation was short lived. Scientists figured it was another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah."" Although the NASA researchers have concluded the ""face"" to be a natural landform, many are not satisfied with it. Many people claim that it was built by aliens, however, pictures do not lie. In conclusion, the ""Face on Mars"" is really a mystery. Many think it is a natural landform while others think that it was built for a reason by aliens.

"Children in the near future could learn in new and exciting ways! The use of the Facial Action Coding System can help children learn lessons that they may not understand in a classrom with one teaching method. This can be excellent for helping children with special needs, finding out how children learn best, and keeping certain problems at a low. I'd say that this can be a revolutionary change for the learning process. Children with special needs, such as ADHD, could be able to learn beter. The machine would be able to read their expression while learning and find a way to keep them on the track they need to go. This could help people with downs too! They could calculate their expression and change the way of teaching to make them better understand what is being taought because some aren't too good at communicating verbally. FACS could help regular chindren learn better too! They could be taought a small lesson on individual devices with FACS on it, while they learn their emotions can be calculated to test to see what way of learning best suits them. They could to this for about 10-15 minutes a day with different teaching methods. After a few weeks the computer should know what method works best for each individual student. At that poiont the time taken could teach each student indeviduallly what they need to know in the way that works best for them and can improve test scores. The system can keep ""troubble"" or problems at a low. This device could keep the attention of the ""troubble makers"" so they dont have to gain attention elsewhere by having lessons that seem to be more fun to the child. It can also tell when a student is lying about important things like bullying and harrassment. FACS can help children with drepression too! A big problem with teens and pre-teens is that the stress of school can cause depression. The article states that pecticing emotions can make u feel that emotion. Children can go to a counselor and have their emotion read then have proper exercises to improve their emotion. In conclusion, FACS can help multiple probles in the learning space. It can inprove learning for children and those with special needs. It can keep certaiain problems such as troubble making children at a low. It can also help children find a way of learning that best suits them. Overall FACS cn make the learning environment a better, more fun place.",0,0.7972617149353027
"Dear state senator, Although the Electoral College has held together for the past couple of years, i believe that it is time for a change. Myself and many others think that a direct election is the way to go. This is because of the winner takes all system. The winner takes all system is that if a presidential canidate has more votes than the other in a state,then the entire states vote goes to the winner. Because of this many canidates don't visit states that are either low points, or that they know that they cant win. This exact event happened in the 2000 campaign, causing 17 states to not see the canidates at all, including states such as Rhode island and South Carolina. Because of this, the entire election was put in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio. So please consider our offer and change the election to a more reliable and more widely agreed on style which is a direct election. -sincerily, an anxious Florida redident.",0,0.737438440322876

"Imagine when cars will be nothing but the future. This is actually kind of easy to imagine, but also very mind-blowing to what the future may hold, no? Well, driverless cars are future and it can only get better. They are a big advancement helpfully to our world, and I am definitely for the development they will bring to us and the world. First of all, driverless cars would become just like a public-transport taxi system, only better. These cars can better improve how we drive, more economically. The smart cars now only ""use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus"". This will help the environment greatly, because with all the pollution from old cars and diesel semi-trucks, our air quality will not be so good if we do not do something to make it better. These driverless cars will help the environment, and it will not add to the problems we have now. With the cars only getting better, the future driverless cars will only advance more as car manufacturers figure out ways to make travel easier. Secondly, the driverless car would include combinations of input to help the actual driving going on on the road. These inputs are needed to help ""mimic the skill of a human at the wheel"". What is the point in a driverless car if it has a driver? There are already cars in our world that can park by themselves and have rear cameras to help with views, but not entirely a car that can do every bit a human can do. The tyes of inputs and sensors the driverless car would have are: position sensors on wheels, sensors on the roof, a video camera for rearview mirrors, a GPS reciever, and a laser that can constantly show us a 3-D mdoel of the car's surroundings. Without all of these features, the car wouldn't be able to actually drive on its own. These sensors will help the driver, (who won't actually be driving) and the car do what it has to do to detect every movement around it. Lastly, these driverless cars are a big safety improvement to our world. Safety in cars is huge in our world today because we use travel more on big, open roads and highways. Many accidents happen on the road, and when accidents happen, it can be costly and harmful to the driver, their car, and their income. While one is in the car, we always want to make sure we get to our destination without any problems. Car accidents do not happen very often to people, but it is also not entirely rare. The features of the driverless car will ensure safety while driving at all times. Many people still text and drive, which is a big concern while on the road for you and for others also driving. When you have a driverless car, you can do what you need to do, and that includes sending a text. You will have a less risk of getting into an accident. Although the ""non-driving driver"" will not have to actually put their hands on the wheel because the car does all the work, the driver still has to be focused on the road. The driver must stay attentive to his or her surroudings because if there are road hazards, the driver must come into play and actually take the wheel until the road is free of hazardous conditions. The driverless car will watch you and you will remain watching the road. It is like a team effort, even though the human only comes into play when they are needed. In all, I am all for driverless cars and its development that comes with it. The cars will be more economical and useful to our public-transport system, the features and sensors that come with it will help the cars drive more smoothly and efficiently, and these cars will better help the world's safety crisis while in a car. Driverless cars are the future, and we are driving ourselves slowly, but surely, onto the road to a better time.",0,0.8673593997955322

"Do you believe that drivers should be able to use a cell phone while operating a vehicle? ""Cell phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts show that this behavior is common and dangerous for teen drivers. In 2017 according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 3,166 people were killed in 2,935 distraction-affected crashes, accounting for 9 percent of all fatal crashes in the United States. Knowing cell phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts may help families manages this dangerous risk."" Cell phone distraction rates are at an all-time high. At the same time, drivers were less likely to be seen holding a cellphone or talking on a hand-held phone than in the prior survey. The problem of distracted driving, especially cellphone use, continues to raise concerns. Texting and driving also appears to be a problem, especially among younger drivers. It is easy to understand why using a hand-held phone is a problem. In addition to having your eye on the road, with one hand on the wheel it is harder to navigate bends and respond to hazards. If the level of difficulty on the road demands a certain amount of driver concentration, but the state of the conversation also requires a depth of thought, then both activities will compete for a bounds amount of cognitive resources. The use of a cell phone should not be allowed while operating a vehicle, I say this because distractions while behind the wheel has caused so much trouble. ""True Motion tracks five levels of distraction: Non-call active usage (texting and app usage); non-call passive usage (hands-free app usage); phone call in-hand; phone call hands-free; and no distraction."" Naturalistic studies in the future may provide the means to document the patterns and circumstances of drivers' phone use and their effects on real-world driving. Currently, the best studies of crash risk used cell phone Company billing records to verify phone use by crash-involved drivers. In conclusion, cell phone use should be limited behind the wheel. Do you believe that cell phone use should be limited behind the wheel? A number of jurisdictions in the United States and around the world have made it illegal for drivers to use hand-held phones. It appears that drivers' phone use will continue to increase, despite the growing evidence of the risk it creates. More effective countermeasures are needed but are not known at this time.",0,0.7304296493530273

"you're best way to learn? well, I think the kids that are studying from their house have benefits because they can do their class work at anytime they want in the day. Like they can turn in classwork after they get off work. Because you have unlimited amount of time to do it. The student that is doing online class would have more time to sleep and, eat their breakfast and whenever they are ready to start their work, they can start working. They don't have to wake as earlier as the rest of the people going to school. Theres less work you get more time to do what you got to do and if got other class online you can will be able to finish the work because they give a lot of time to complete the units. It's good because if a student don't like going to school they have another way of doing work. another reason that online school is good because if you finish all you're work for the online class you can take a break till they give you more work and, once you finish all the work for the year your done for the year. Those are the many reasons I think online class are benefited to some students in school. But at the sometime their disadvantages of taking online class because you don't have someone to help when your having trouble on homework. Like you will be very confused about the subject,and you won't know what to do. Or if you lose internet you won't be able to turn in the work cause their's no connection. Or if you forget to do your online classwork. You also have to complete the in a specific amount of time. Like if you don't finish on time it possible ruin your chance of passing the online class. Another reason why online can't be as good as normal school is because the person doing the online class isn't getting one on one contact with other students and teachers. Also if you start having problems with the website to do your online work it would be difficult for the student to finish his work. These are the many disadvantages of taking online class. If i was to pick between these option, I would pick going to normal school because you might have problems with website,internet or you might just forget about it.

If you were to not allow students to bring their phones they would feel the need to bring them anyway and could possibly get suspended for bringing their cellular devices. If you allow cell phones in the school some students might actually not want to bring their phones because of the fact that they are allowed.

"In France  the education system seach to  bring the most of knowledge  possible. There is no specialisation until  the higth school and  even there  the specialisation  is not really clear. As a result  french students have got  plenty of knowledge  on serval subjects but  they have to do long studies to have  un precise knowledge of some thing.
   I do not think  that this way is the best way in the world in which we live, In fact, in our world we ask people to be ready to work  very soon. And the fact is that you cannot work with a broard knowledge. The only  thing you can do is speaking whith people at restaurants and amazing  them thanks to your  general culture.
 Now to have  a job you have to be  specialised because the technology of our day is very specific  and precise, you can work if you do not know precisly  your job. For instance, what do we think of a doctor who know  a little about  economy, a little about astronomy and a little about  the way the body of a man works.

He has no choice but to work but helps his community by making nice tasty hamburgers to two hundred of people a day, making them happy as they eat the best burgers in their life. Going to a fast-food doesn't seem that exciting, but some people do it on a regular basis. This wouldn't be possible without Mark.Moreover, by studying biology, Mark will one day fill the empty space left by an old and tired citizen in an hospital or in a laboratory making research for cancer.
We can say that Mark contribute twice to helping his community by feeding its inhabitants and assuring its future health as he studies.
No one can say that young people do not give enough time to helping their community because, as they make their way through life, they are assuring the survival of this community: by studying and by doing different jobs no one wants to hear about.

Another aspect of young people's actions for their community simply is their wish to travel. Lots of cultural exchanges are made in high-schools and colleges. This allows communities to know more about other cultures in the world, to be more open-minded and comprehensive toward people of other background, that may be leaving in the neibourghoods. It stengthens the links inside the community and between different communities.",0,0.8946738243103027
"Do you think aliens are real? If they are can they make landforms and make them look natural? IN 1976 NASA captured a photo on Mars that looked like a face. Some people thin that aliens made the face. I know that the face is not made by aleins and is a natural landform. The reasons I know this is because there are things like this that happen on Earth. Also NASA says that the face was only shawdos that made it look like a face and they also sent other ships with better cameras to take pictures. First is that things like this happen on Earth too. The Grand Canyon was a natural thing that happened. Landfroms are common in the west U.S. Rock formations hapen everywhere on earth. Also NASA says this is the equivalent to a mesa. People still did not belive it was natural. Another reason I know this is natural is because NASA says that the eyes, nose, and, mouth where only shawdos and where not there. People still belived that is was aleins. NASA sent another space ship up to mars to take pictures. So they sent the Mars Global Surveyor up. It can takes picture up to 10 times better than the Viking 1. Last is the Mars Globoal Surveyor. It flew over cydonia and snapped a photo that was 10 times better than the Viking 1. In the photo you can see that it is only a rock formation. Also in the photo you can see it has not dark spots that where the eyes,nose,and mouth as you can see in the Viking photo. You can still see a what appears to be a mouth in he rock though. In 2001 the MGS took a photo and it has no markings that llok like a face. In conclusion the face on Mars was proven wrong by Nasa's Mgs. The face is not real and it was only a formation with shadows.Aliens did not make the face. With better technology you can see that the face is not there and aleins did not make it.",0,0.7418162822723389
"Have you ever wondered the emotional expressions of students? Me too, which is why the Facial Action Coding System can help solve this problem. It compares everything to a ""neutral"" face, so you can see if you're one hundred percent happy, one hundred percent sad, etc. Each emotion will be distributed in the results of the test. Dr. Paul Eckman being the creator. It can be used as an emotion indicator on students in a classroom. Dr. Paul Eckman has classified the tool to only six basic emotions, which he says,""Happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadnessand then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" For example, he noticed that when people raised their eyebrows they became ""surprised."" Or if you tighten your lips, you show ""anger."" He sees signs of emotion with each expression the face makes. Video imagery is even being used to spot emotions in pictures or paintings. The pictures being able to describe the faces of the children. Dr. Huang states that,""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal."" So even though many kids have different emotional faces, each student is making the same expression. The software can even see mixed emotions, just like in ""Mona Lisa."" We make the same calculations every day. For example, if you were a teacher looking at your students, you could most likely tell how someone was feeling by the look on their face. Dr. Huang says,""Artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions."" So da Vinci used an altered version of this way back when, but was mostly mental capabilities. The value of reading the students emotions, could become very helpful in seeing if a student is having trouble in class or with friends. Muscle differences can even indicate a false emotion! The author says,""the zygomatic major (muscles that begin at your cheek bones) lift the corners of your mouth, and in a false smile the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" So if you catch one of your students smiling sideways at you, then you know they're treating you to a fake smile. Faces don't lie... if you notice a student false smiling then you may find that they are lying. Try not to use false smiles because you might get caught. This technology is useful to sensing the emotions of the students in a classroom. If someone is having trouble with classwork, then this could help to determine the problem and find a fix. The video imagery is useful in finding emotion in old pictures from the past. Also, being able to check if someone is using a fake smile is quite handy in terms of the truth. All in all, the Facial Action Coding System is a handy tool that helps sense the students emotions.",0,0.7975295186042786
"Most people think using their phone while they are driving is smart, but it really isn't. When you use a phone and drive at the same time it's called distracted driving. Other people are doing the same thing an then you both aren't paying any attention and you both end up crashing. Cell phone usage while driving isn't very safe at all. When you are using it, you aren't really paying attention to the road. It's a safety hazard with a lot of people driving and using their phone. In the united states alone, just fifteen years ago, there were only 4.3 million people that use cell phones. Today there are 224 million people that use them as of now. Your cell phone gets used everywhere you go such as the shopping and trying to find the item you need or even when you are making a list to go to the store to buy school supplies. People talk on their phones everyday while they drive or even around the house to keep in contact with others. In several cases, drivers have been in a lot of accidents and it's been, because of their cell phone and people sue either you or your insurance company depending on the accident and what happens. People also have been held liable for the accidents involving their phone, because they were the one that wasn't paying attention and was distracted. Cells are convenient for people, but they don't know how to properly use them. Begin on your phone is so dangerous and people need to understand it's not really that important to be on your phone while you're driving unless something is really wrong then you need to pull over and find out what's going on. In the united states they have a law called ""hands free"". When your being on your phone while your driving is a distraction that lead to fatal consequences. The consequences aren't normally very good, because when an accident happens and you were on your phone you can be sued very badly and you'll probably be in trouble and struggle with money. Its best if all drivers will stay off their phones while they drive. In the end of the day there are a lot of people dying in accidents, because of distracted drivers. So always pay attention to the road while you're driving and don't be on your phone. In the end its always smart to not be on your phone while you drive. Use your phone when you at a complete stop or if it's safe to. If everyone would work on this the accident percentage wouldn't be so high in the united states.",0,0.8073022365570068
"The discovery on Cydonia On May 24,2001 NASA's spacecraft named Viking 1 had spotted on Cydonia a shadowy figure that resembled a human face. Which I believe is that this shadowy figure that resembles a human face on Cydonia is just a natural landform. This discovery is a natural landform and the reason why I believe its a natural landform is beacuse that when you see the photos from 1976,1998,and 2001 they resemble a natural landform of a human face. For instance when the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived on Cydonia to take a picture of this new found discovery. The cheif scientist of NASA Jim said that ""We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it."" that gives us proof that when the (MGS) took a shot of this face it looked like it was a natural landform on Cydonia. My second supportive claim is that the (MGS) has a better camera then the Viking 1. It's camera has a digital image is better cause you can see clearly. He also said that ""As a rule thumb you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size"", he added. ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground of Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks,you could see what they were!"" Jim also said. This gives you a clear understanding that this is just a landform that was there naturally and not by aliens. Finally, to conclude that I believe that this is a natural landform and not created by aliens is that if you play real close attention to the photographs this resembles natural causes and not supernatural causes from anything. Also it can be described as a natural landform is how the features are and how it looks natural and how it looks like a rock and not an aircraft or anything made by aliens or to be described as an alien monument or artifact.",0,0.6717997789382935
"Venus also called Evening Star is the second planet on the Solar System and is more similar to earth than any other planet. the scientist believe that at some point of time Venus might have been covered in oceans just like Earth and might have supported life forms that was able to live in venus. it is also the closest in terms of size and density. Venus has hot surface on the ground that make it impossible for the life orm to exist in venus. Venus surface is so hot that it can even melt down a sub marine that is designed to be in a harsh environment undernearth the ocean. thats the reason that no human has ever touched the Venus surface before. Scientist have tried many times to research the Venus surface but all they can do is to reasearch from Earth because every atempt to land on Venus has been unmanned and for reasons since on spacecraft has survived the landing for more than few hours. that is the reason why no spaceship has touced down on Venus surface for more than three decades. Venus is covered by 97 percent of Carbondioxide blankets. there is also Sulfuric acid that cover the Venus atmosphere. Venus surface is 800 degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times more that on Earth. Thats is way too hot and dangerous for a human to live in. They also have similar features as Earth like volcanoes erruption, powerfull Earthquakes and frequent lightning. it also have Valley, Mountain and craters. Nasa came with a idea for a vehicle that can go upto 30 mph and is like a fighter jet that never touches the ground. Taking pictures of Venus from a ship that is orbiting or hovering safely above the planet is providing limited insight on ground condition because light cannot penetrate the thick atmosphere that covers the planet. Scientist are working on inventing mechanical computers like the ones they used in World War 2. Nasa is also working on equipment that they can use on Venus. they are testing those equipment or materials on harsh enivironment similar to on Venus but the longest they have survived is 3 weeks. Dangerous and challenging it is Scientist believe it is worth it because we can gain knowledge about the planet. Venus has harsh environment but if we can figure out a way to travel between planet it will open many opportunities and space travel will be posible and humans might be able to live not only on Venus but on other planets too.",0,0.7385390400886536
"The advantages of limiting car usage is that less gas is released, thus causing a steady, more healthier Earth. Limiting cars is completely world changing. Although most people arent in favor of the cause, they dont know the real effects of the gas that is produced by cars around the world. The gasses that are released from cars are very hazardous to the ozone, and can cause environmental changes if too much gas is released. For example in Paris, they had a almost near-record pollution buildup, and since diesel is popular in France because of a tax policy that favors diesel over standard gasoline, the gas released from diesel was more thicker and hazardous. After a bunch of air pollution built up, they enforced a ban that would stop cars from driving for a specific amount of time to halt the gas buildup. If you were caught driving when the ban was active,you were fined 22 euros, (or in american currency, 31 dollars) and people the declined the fine, the authorities impounded their car. Paris was generous enough to allow public transit and it would be free of charge, but it wasn't too easy for the companies to budge because they would be losing money. In Bogota, Columbia, they have already been taking action in this gas problem, by banning cars for a specific amount of time, but this is their third straight year doing this. This campaign originated in the 1990s and was said to improve Bogota. They have constructed 118 miles of bicycle paths and have promoted bicycle use. A business man named Carlos Arturo said that ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" which is entirely true. Their goal is to get people to use alternate transportation and to reduce the smog that the cars created.",0,0.7542070150375366
"The Electoral College gives certain states, based on their popularity, a number of how many of what I guess can be called ""points"" that will go to to the candidate that gets the most votes for themself out of that state. Now whether that is a good idea or not is completely based on your own opion which you can decide. But I disagree with the Electoral College, even though it did take me a while of thinking I came to the conclusion that an all out popular vote is more effecient when it comes to voting for a president than the electoral college, and there is three main reasons that swung me to side with popular vote, First of all, when you get right down to it the Electoral College just doesnt give perfect accuracy on who does actually get the exact most votes. Some people cant completely grasp this fact but imagine that there is Florida, Alaska, and Montana. The first candidate, which we shall call John and the second, Bill, are going for these three states. John beats Bill on Florida 5,000 to 4,999 and John gets all 29 electoral votes because of that, tough luck for Bill. Luckily for Bill he sweeps over John in Alaska 100 to 0 and Monatana 100 - 0 and gets 3 points from each state which gives him 6 points total. So now by popular vote Bill would win with 5,199 votes against John's 5,000. But since Bill only has 6 Electoral points because he still lost Florida, which was the state John won and got a whopping 29 points from, Bill will lose his campaign to John 29-6 because thats what the amazing ""wonders"" of the Electoral College are. Which beasically sums up how in 2000 Al Gore lost to Bill Gates even that Al Gore had more overall votes. The Electoral College also makes candidates have to strategically plan out their campaign so they can focus on big states and swing states only. If a candidate knows he will not win a certain state he wont even focus on it because it would be pointless, even if he changes maybe a couple thousand voters' minds, it wont get him a single point if he loses that state 5000 - 15000 whereas with popular vote changing the mind of people so that you get yourself from having 10% of California's overall votes for you to 30% means more votes than literally all of Alaska's eligible voting population. So that drives candidates away from states they wont win and they go to states known as ""swing states"" that dont have a specific party that they vote for every election, and they will attempt to win these states votes the most because those points will make the biggest difference. The final thing I'd like to touch on is that the Electoral College system takes so many peoples idea and erases it. We want our vote to mean something throughout the whole campaign, but it doesnt matter if you are one the few democrat supporters in an overall republican dominated state because when your state loses 5000 to 150, poof! There goes your vote floating off into oblivion because it doesnt matter now, your one vote doesnt stand a chance against 50 going against it according to the Electoral College. We want our vote to count for the candidate himself not be part of some majorly flawed point system that someone thought would help somehow when picking the right candidate to become the head honcho sitting in charge of The White House, Our Country, and be the overall leader of our military forces too. So we need our vote to be heard and for it to actually count, even if 5000 more people disagree with 2500 in the same state, those 2500 votes should actually count towards something instead of being overrun and erased by the 5000 which will earn some candidate a couple of points for their campaign. Now after all this not only has my own opinion strongly changed in favor of popular vote but I hope yours has too. Electoral College just doesnt provide that actual perfect accuracy of who wins that popular does, it forces presidents to only visit and campaign in certain states that they have a chance of winning, and it takes citizens votes and throws them down the drain if more people in the same state vote differently. It just makes you sit and wonder whos idea it was to accept this system.",0,0.7343173623085022
"Phones & Driving I say we should not be allowed to use cell-phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Because according to today's research most accidents are caused by the use of cell-phones while driving. I honestly believe if more people stop using cell-phones while driving, it wouldn't be as many accidents as there is in today's society. After doing research it says "" drivers are at a four times greater risk of a crash"" and that is because of cell-phones. Also, when you are driving and using your phone it distracts from what's going on around you. In the United States they have a law that if you are on your phone while driving you can get a ticket or furthermore get arrested. Now that they have passed that law i rarely see people use their phones while driving. Over the past couple of decades the use of phones while driving was the main cause of accidents. ""Driver distraction, a sub-category of inattention, has been estimated to be a contributing factor in 8% to 13% of all crashes"". When people get into accidents its alot that can happen like injuries, the insurance companies, and other people may be in the car with them. Before we try to stop letting people use their phones while driving they say it's a lot of other things that distract drivers as well like eating, arguing, listening to music, and yelling at other drivers. However, i believe most drivers use cell-phones may be having important calls from family, or co-workers saying they need you to fill in for them. I can personally say i've had personal experiences with someone using a cell-phone with me in the car. My grandma she was pulling in to my uncle's church and she was trying to call someone and she hit a block that was holding a stop sign and it messed up the front of her car. Another one is my mom she was driving and she was swerving in and out of lanes and she almost ran into a pickup truck. I have many more but im just praying that everyone leaves driving with phones in 2018 because i don't want any harm coming to me or anybody else i know. In conclusion, we all as a community and globally we should restrict from using cell-phones while operating a vehicle. This year i don't plan on experiencing any vehicle accidents because of someone on their phone while driving. So i iree' miller say NO to phones while driving.",0,0.7714464664459229

"Most people that drive today are reckless drivers. Speeding, road-rage, drunk driving and many more.Technology has came a long way since the twentith century. Using technology to enhance the driving experience could be a great advancement on automobiles. To begin, Some people might say that driverless cars are undependable, but I think that driverless cars would make a much more safer driving environment. Using driverless cars would help regulate people that speed, racing and many more dangerous things people do on the road. Using driverless cars could help people that are driving under the influence. Since the car has sensors on them, this could help the driver get to their destination safely. This invention would help our economy because in the passage it states that the driverless cars would use half as much gas as an average taxi. Even though people are making driverless cars, the inventors also want to make sure the driver is being responsible. In the passage it says that manufacturers are considering using cameras to watch the driver to make sure that the driver is paying attention and focusing on the road. To make the car ride more enjoyable for the rider, manufactuers are planning on making in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. This information systems' display will have alerts and blinking lights to tell the driver when it needs to take the wheel. To conclude, I think driverless are the next big thing. These cars provide safe and controlled driving. I feel that these cars are very economical and would save people a lot of money. If these cars make it to mainsteam this could change the driving world as we know it. That's why I believe that people should use driverless cars.",0,0.8055555820465088

"Cars are almost everywhere, And as they say ''Where ever theres a car, There is polution''. Well thats not what they actually say but thats what they should be said. I mean can you just imaging the gases and smoke coming out of just one car,Its a lot right well now picture a country full of cars and trucks now thats cause for damage. limliting car use can have advantages on the world and ourselfs as a person. One city in germany is making a change for the better. In VABAN, Germany population of just about 5,500 people, About 70 percentl of the people there do not own cars as said in source three of the article,It also states that 57 percent of people sold there cars to move and live there. this plays a part in the advantge of less air polution, ''Fresh air'' when people say i need some fresh air he not really breathing fresh air unless hes sniffing a tree tahts has just gone to phtosynthisis.Not to mention the gas, In VAUBAN instead of having to use the gas for cars it can be used for other day to day things. although there is less polution in VANBAN it is nothing compared to the air polution that has already been let out but to make things better we all have to start somehwere. less air polution is good but it might take years before we can implimant a law or rule to have less cars around the world. something good that you can get out of not having a car right off the bat is less stress and being calm.''When i had car i was always tense, i am much happier this way.(source 3) heidrun walker, a media trainer and a mother of two stated that.

In my opinion people don't need cars if places are two blocks away. i see it as an acsesorie, Or another toy to play with, But this toy has a cost.

"Students tend to forget the curricular over the long period of not being at school. I would understand because my middle school required everyone to be assign on either projects/assignments over summer, to assure our learning. Having the teacher design the summer project is better then having students design them for many reasons. Teachers know what to put into the summer project and know that the students would use their knowledge to complete the assignment. Teachers have the ability to acquire the knowledge that they teach to their students and assign the projects to the students' understanding. I have done a summer project in middle school just so I would not forget my studies. Plus, to maintain their knowledge it would have been school related, in order to continue their learning process. It would make the student feel at ease when coming back to school. Students would have forgotten the subjects over the summer break by the time they start school again. Knowing that they would, requiring them to complete a summer project is appropriate. From my experience, I know that in math they start to review a little of the course that I took last year to prepare me for the math that I would take this year. To be ready for the next curricular, students need to review themselves over break to know the basic understanding of what the other subject is going to build off on. Which is the reason on having the teachers to create the project base on the subjects that they learned throughout the course. Although having to work on a project over summer can be a positive outcome, there are negative outcome with it. The project that the teachers would make, can be boring and students do not want to have a summer project to ruin their summer break. I would have given up and procrastinate whenever there is a project assign to me over break. If the student design the project it would not very educational, they would not know what to do on the project. Having a teacher-designed project is important to their education and to the school. Their lack of understanding of creating a summer project that has to be important to their electives and their learning. In conclusion, having the teacher to design a summer project is purely out of knowledge within the curricular that they teach to the students themselves. Keeping up with the students' education is important to boast their confidence to the next subject. The students would understand the requirement of their project if the teacher created the project instead of the students. Acquiring the course throughout the summer break would help with their next subject and obtaining a recall on the course.",0,0.771195113658905
"In our modern time of new ways of communication via television or internet it is not difficult to make a product seem much better through advertisements than it really is. 

Lets take for example a pencil which is praised to be of very high qualitiy at tele-shopping, of course for a low price. 
The costumer will pick up the telephone and order this lovely pencil.
Two weeks later he got the small packet with the little pencil in it and he can't wate to open it. Still he thinks he made a good deal with what he bought on TV, very practical and easy buying. But what happens in the end? The colour of the pencil is blue instead of black as it was shown on TV. The writing is not that lovely as it was described in the advertisment. What now? Big disappointment. 

As we see in this little example the new medias have the power to manipulate the costumer in a way he does not even take note of it.

The composion of the light in which the product is recorded, or the frame in which it is showed can make it seem bigger, smaller, nicer etc. For the costumer it is hard to imagine how the product looks like in reality. This kind of manipulation bz making things appear better than thez really are is a profession for itself, in that way one can imagine how effective these tools must be.

Conclusona;in may opinion in many cases the original product is very different in aspect and quality so that one has to be carefull with too fast decisions about buying a product.
It is always better to put down the glasses of advertisments and look with zour own eyes",0,0.8659966588020325
"Benefits Of Attending Online Classes From Home I believe student's would benefit from attending online classes from home. From my position I believe this would help student's who speak different langauges, help students with learning disabilities, and give the student a better learning enviroment. Alot of school's don't offer the capibility of online courses, online courses should be discussed more and provided for the student's who need it. Also being at home might make the individual feel more comfortable. Learning from home with online courses would be a great idea. Student's who speak different langauges or that are from a different country might have a hard time adjusting to their new school. This is an example where being at home while taking online course's would help. This would help because the online course could provide the langauge the student need's so they could understand. Also the school would save some time and hassle with trying to find an individual teacher that could help this student every second of the day. This is a great example for the student to take online course's at home so the individual would be able to understand better and have a good atmosphere to learn in. Some people have learning disabilities, they might not learn like everyone else dose. Not everyone learns the same including myself, I find it easier to visually learn. Some students might find it hard to learn in school and they feel more comfortable at home learning on a online class. It's the little things like this you can change to make a big difference to help someone out. The key to learning is to find somthing that makes sense to you, online classes from home could help people learn better and understand more that have learning disabilities. Being at home is an awsome learning enviroment because your comfortable and you can stay focused. School's have alot of distractions with people talking and being loud. Having loud distractions makes learning hard for myself and other people. A better learning enviroment like being at home makes it easier to concentrate better and helps you to be able to get your work done in a timely manner. Cutting out distractions and being focused more with a better enviroment is a great idea to keep you on task from learning from home. I think learning from home with online classes is a great idea. This is a great idea because this helps people who speak different langauges, helps people with learning disabilities, and gives student's a better working and learning enviroment. When we make students comfortable it helps them understand and want to sucseed. Learning from home should be discussed more and should be a option to all schools. This is a great way to improve our schools and a great idea for or future generation.",0,0.7530339956283569
"Many companies are beginning to design, produce, and test driverless cars. However, many of these cars are not completely driverless and dangerous. Driverless cars should not become legal on the road because they are dangerous and unnecessary. The majority of driverless cars are not completely driverless. Most require a driver to take control over the car in more ""difficult"" or ""complicated"" road conditions as stated in the article. ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" Cars that are capable of moving themselves but still need help from a driver at times are not driverless cars. Truly driverless cars would not need assistance and would be able to move itself in any scenario which would be much more dangerous than the current cars and dirvers we have today. Funding research that will ultimately make our roads less safe is not an investment that many people would like to take part in. Instead of funding research to develop these dangerous, self driving cars, money should be going toward repairing our current roads, making our current cars safer, and helping our drivers learn to drive more safely. To sum up, driverless cars are unnecessary and dangerous and should therefore not be on our roads. We also should not continue funding the research of driverless cars and instead spend the money to bettering the current system we already have in place.",0,0.7998756766319275
"Dear Senator, i am writing this letter in regaurds to the way we citizens vote. I feel as though we should vote using the popular vote. There are many different reasons i feel so strongly about this. So i will start telling you why i feel so strongly about this. First,i think that the President and Vice President should be choose by our votes. The reason being is becasue we know what we want for our country. we look for the good and things like that in our president. I think it is only fair that we use the voting tecnique most votes because that means everyone gets a say on who runs our country. Another reason i think we should go that route is beacuse people sometimes feel left out in all the things that have to do with our country. People want a president that keeps his/her word and one that can be the right person for the job. They want someone who knows who to be a leader because the person who gets chosen has this job for 4 years. I think that people have a right to vote for who they want to vote for not who the electors pick. I have no idea if this is aking any type of sense but i am writing this the best way i understand it. That is how i feel about this whole thing i think people should have equal rights. I also think that people should be able to pick who they want to be their leader. They should be able to view thier opitions and see what is best for not only the country but aslo their familes and themselfs. That is all i have to say about this whole thing.",0,0.7395048141479492
"Process or Place? This is a question you need to ask yourself. Yes, in my opinion, Electoral College is a good idea. In the cases of having an Electoral College there are some up sides of this and some down sides. In an Electoral College it restores some of the weight in political balance. It also required a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. When an Electoral College restores th balance in some large states its a good thing. It states in this article that, "" The popular vote was very close in Flordia, nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes."" This is stating that the large states votes becomes one. Also, when this talks about how it requirs a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal is also a good thing. it says in this passage,"" No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" Again this is saying that none of our votes get uncounted for, we are all counted as one. Some might say that they dont know where their votes are going to but when you think about they are all going to the same place in one factor.",0,0.8450928330421448
"With the advancement of technology, cars are now being altered to fit human wants. Driverless cars are advancing in recent years. According to the text, car companies and manufacturers such as Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan are all in plan of the development of these cars to be sold by the year 2020. These cars may appear as eye-candy at first glance, however they can cause danger to the people in certain conditions in many ways. Driverless cars seem spectacular, however people are unaware that it is not ""driveless"" as the manufacturers say. These cars have the ability to complete the basic necessities of driving, such as steering, accelerating, and braking, but there is a problem with this. The text explains how the new cars are not able to be driven in certain conditions such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. Because of this, the human driver must stay alert throughout the entire drive when the car is in need of an extra hand. This is a problem beacuse humans could get bored of waiting or get distracted which is problematic if the car is not fast enough to warn the human. In short, actually having humans agree to the comitment of being ready to take over the task of driving in a driverless car seems to be unrealistic. With all this being said, someone might ponder on how the car could be slow to warn the human. Creating a driverless car means a person has to put all their trust into a large piece of technology. This could cause many problems, for example, the text explains how the cars are equipt with many cameras and sensors. This is problematic because if the car's technology has a defect in it in some way, the human in the car will most likely get in an accident without doing anything. According to the text, many places such as California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia have made it illegal to test computer-driven cars there. Finally, in the case of an accident actually occuring, the problem people would face is if the car manufacturer or the human would be the one to blame. In the end, driverless cars are not safe and could lead to many problems. Driverless cars are approaching into the world fast. This new technology should not be trusted due to the speed of its development. Humans could face many problems with these cars now entering today's society. To conclude, driverless cars appear to be an extravegant idea however, when acutually thought out, many issues could occur leaving problems in the end.",0,0.8350716829299927
"25 years ago something happened that made headlines for magazines and newpapers it was also talked about on the radio. There has been a picture taken and sent back to NASA and apears to be a face on mars. Working as a scientist at NASA. I truley believe that this is just another thing people freak out about and soon to realize it was nothing. Let me explain to you what it really is or what I believe it to be. In 1976 a picture was taken and people believed it was ""aliens"" that someone that is not human make a structure and make a face on mars. 1998 another picture was taken of the same face and it looked more clear. The ""face on mars"" doesn't really look like a face anymore. There are still people talking about because of one single picture to look at. In 2001 another picture was taken and this time it looks more like a hill or a platue type structure. People still want to believe it was aliens because they like the whole alien thing and want to stand out. As a working scientist in NASA I think that this is just a hill or something we have on earth. Something nature and not made by aliens. I think this because anythink can seen something it is not. Like for an example the picture that looks like a face has to do with shadow and perspective. If we were to take another picture with the sun facing a different way. The illution of the face would be not there. It's like loooking at a cloud and you see a face or a object we have seen before. It's still a cloud,but it looks that way because the shape and the position we are standing at. This is why I think it's just another hill that has some shadows and the illution of a face. In conclution this face on mars is something not to be freaking out about. It's something that seens what it is not. There are many things on this world that you can look at and say ""oh that looks like face"" and when you look at it longer you realize its nothing. You dont hear people talking about this today in 2016 becuase it is one of those things you hear and forget because it turned out to be really just a hill with illution. This is my reasons why I think that its not a face or it is not alien activity.",0,0.773542582988739
"As a country progresses, enhances its economic power, it also leads to an increase in the purchasing power of the people in the country. In twenty years time, people are expected to have higher incomes and purchasing power than at present. Having a house and a car are basic necessities and it does seem indispensable to most of us. I totally disagree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than they are at present. I will support my opinion in the following paragraphs.

The first reasoning that I would like to put forward is that as a country is moving from an under-developed to being a developing country or a developing country to a developed country, over time it will lead to increase in employment levels, which will subsequently lead to a rise in the income levels and purchasing power of the people. For instance, in my own country, India, there are a lot of individuals and families who own cars today than the last twenty years. The traffic for cars in cities like Delhi and Bombay, where the income levels are rising rapidly, there is also evidence of more number of cars in such places. The statistics show the number of persons owning cars have only been increasing over the years. 

The second reason that I would advance for my argument is, that  car is a very convenient mode of transportation. Personally, I feel, it is more convenient for most of us than air planes, bikes, buses and other modes of transportation. It offers a kind of flexibility which is incomparable. Its very practical for everyday use.

The third reasoning would be it has a lot of utility for people with families, which all of us do! A situation where most people are owning their own air planes or buses is not quite palatable to me. Cars have also become very sophisticated and user-friendly these days. There are a whole whole of models and prices to choose from.

 To conclude, cars, in my opinion, falls under the category of a 'need' and not a 'luxury' . What could possible happen twenty years down, is that the cars could get even more sophisticated. There could be even more models for cars, much more than what is present today.",0,0.8640710115432739
In this story the auther gloryfies how amazing venus is an he give a whole bunch of details such as it is very bright and also by saying it was almos eath-like long ago.he also states that venus could more and likely be our home town someday in case of an emergency. And he also made it seem like its been un expord witch it hasnt due to the harsh conditions on the planet. NASA is working on ways to explor it but they cant get to the planet for mor then 3 weeks so their data isnt enugh. they have also tired simple technology like cumputers. I think studyinng venus would be very fun becuse its si unexplored and theirs so much to learn about like why is the cinditions the way they are and why cant we visit? and why cant we make something that last more then a week. so yes i think the auther did pretty good job of explanning himself and why its fun to study venus. i like this stor in presents us with new challanges we need to face and overcome as a country and what we can do with our imagenation,0,0.8420608043670654
"Venus, Earth's ""twin"" sister is a extordinary planet that may have been the most earth like planet in our solar system according to paragraph 4. It is also stated that Venus may have probably been covered largely with oceans that could support all form of life. Due to the dense atmosphere and toasty temperatures around 170 degrees fahrenheit. It has been impossiple to let alone land on venus but even taking samples of Venus's rock, gas, or anything else from a distance. Many drones have been sent there to gather information about Venus according to paragraph 2. Each mission to land on Venus has ben unmanned due to the problem of no spacecraft not being able to survived the landing for more than a few hours. Even with all these issues with venus, stated in paragraph 7. NASA is still working on other approaches to studying Venus because again it is a extordinary planet that is said to have been suitible for all forms of life. Finding out what happend to make Venus be in the state it is right now would help the human race from stopping Earth from becoming like Venus. There has been many ideas to get a view on venus ground conditions such as peering from a orbiting ship but that would only give a limited insight due to the dense atmosphere. On paragraph 6 it is stated ""Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus"". That just goes to show you how landing on Venus or even getting the smallest bit of sample of it is a worthy pursit despite the risks and dangers of it. The curiosity of the human race is a powerful thing, Even though Venus is described as a dangerous planet. One day we will figure out the secrets Venus hold and perhaps even have a human land on the surface as well, until then we will just keep on working on more innovations that will one day allow us to get the insight of Venus.",0,0.7457286715507507
"People all over the world often discuss, wheather young peoole spend enough time helping the communities. I think that lots of young people are concernd about community and also hlep them a lot.

First of all I think this already starts in school. In every class the pupils elect one of them to be a speaker for the hole class. You have also pupils doing that for the complete school. So they learn early about being reposable for class mates and training their social skills, which is very useful for being a person who helps others and so the communities. 
But I also think that you can help community if you get yourself a good education. Because you might help better, if you have a huge knowlege in managing thinks or organisation. So I a high education standard is a big help for comunity, if the people have better jobs they will be more likely to hlep than an unemployed person who thinks that it is the communities fault that he has no job.
Moreover ther are lots of young people envolved in different organisations. They help in sport clubs for example, by organize trainig sessions or they help planning activities for the members like campings or visiting pools or cities. So they help to avoid that smaller children spend to much time by their own.
Morover I think young people also help community by doing their civil work. After finishing school the male persons will be able to do social work instead of going to the army. So lots of jobs could not be paid to be done by professional trained employers so this people help that this work is done. Lots of young people also participate in organisations as first aid or the free fireworks. So they help in their free time rescueing other people, which I think is very veluable to communities.

All in all I think there are lots of young people who care about and help communitiy, but there are also some who do not care, which is often see by more people so that they think all young people are that way.",0,0.9367655515670776
"Dear, Principal Do not take cell phone away, I think that policy 1 is the better choice for three reason and i will tell you them reasons in this letter.

The second reason is that the phone can be used for many reason, hear is one example, if u don't have or forget your calculator your phone can be used as a calculator. The third reason is that if the office or a teacher need to get a hold of a your parents or another family member, but they don't have that persons number you can give them the number from your contact list in your phone.

"I agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject, because one subject isn't enough information. With all the broad knowledge of many academic subjects we are studying, it's been experimented that we only use 1% of our brain.
	We should know about everything going on around us, if we specialize on one specific subject it will affect our future, the technologies, and we'd be missing on alot. God gave as a brain for a reason.
	For example if you choose to concentrate on Physics, you can't study phyics without taking Algebra. You could study many academic subjects but concentrate on ur favorite subject more, this way you wont be missing on anything.
	Imagine a world with no doctors, engineers or business. Disease's would spread because their wont be any cures for them. People would live in the streets, and there won't be any street except a sandy dirty place. People would fight over anything they find because it doesn't belong  to anyone, and there's no grocery store or any shops. Therefore alot of people will commite suicide, because there wont be anything to do.
	Studying many academic subjects isn't alot, you have 12 years of studying in school that is more than enough. Then you graduate and go to University, you will still study there but less hours. You would be majored in any of you're favoured topics and the rest would only help finishing you're credits and wasting time so you wouldn't get bored.
 	Me myself I'm a very lazy person and I would preffer if we don't study academic subjects, but if you think about it for a few seconds and imagine how you're life would be you will imaditely change you mind, because there won't be anything to complain on and life would be useless.",0,0.8554913401603699
"Studying Venus Planets are a very interesting, Earth, Mars, Venus, and others are all planets in the solar system. Venus is an interesting one, and one that not much is known about. This is why Venus must be explored and have discoveries made. Venus is a planet that is worhty of being studied and there are reasonable factors as to why that is. The planet Venus would save time while visiting it, it is much like Earth, and if it was researched many important discoveries about the weather could be made. Venus is worth being studied because it is one of the closer planets to Earth. It is a planetary neighbor to earth. In the article,""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" it states,"" Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel"" (Par. 4).Because Venus is a closer planet to Earth time could be saved and there would not be a worry about time being lost as if traveling to a different planet. Secondly, Venus has similarties to Earth, ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters"" (Par. 4). Just like on Earth Venus also includes the same quality land features. Going to Venus and discovering the way the land features form would be a magnificent thing to discover and being able to see how the earthquakes and natural disasters appeasr. Lastly, while exploring Venus, reasoning for the temperatures and dangers of Venus could possibly be prevented. If someone was to discover how to prevent the dangerous factors then maybe there would not be a problem to land on Venus. Making that discovery is important and would help scientists learn more about Venus. The article states,"" On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth""(Par. 3). Taking time to discover Venus could be a great thing. Although Venus is a dangerous Planet with crucial temperatures, exploring the planet could be very beneficial to scientists and multiple discoveries could be made. Venus is a planet that is worhty of being studied and there are reasonable factors as to why it is. The planet Venus would save time when visiting it, it is much like Earth, and if it was researched many important discoveries about the weather could be made. Contributing to the study of Venus may be challenging, but in the end would be quite beneficial and would make a difference.",0,0.7239057421684265
"We all are aware of the fact that  ""Knowledge of Divine"". By academic studies we gain some knowledge to prove ourselves in our concerned fields.

      I disagree with the statement ""it is better to have broad knowledge than to specialize in one specific subject"".  As we know ""Rolling stone has no moss"", similarly the man with interests in many subjects is not worthful.   

    The reason for which i disagree is that a person with specialisation in one specific subject will have more demand than a person with knowledge of many academic subjects. As we see people in our daily life, a lecturer, a draughtsman, a lawyer, etc. these are all specialists in one particular subject. 
 
    The second reason is that as we know  that this world is full of competition. Everyone faces competition in his field. If we are specialised in one particular subject, we can thrive hard and we can get rid of this competition, by having immense knowledge of one subject. 

    The third reason i would like to present, is that a person's ability of learning may be more , but it is limited to a particular filed or a particular subject. If anyone wishes to have broad knowledge of many acedemic subjects he may not be able to grasp all the stuff from the subject. Its not just the matter of possible or not , its just impossible to anyone to have such a memorising or knowledge accumulating power. 

The last and final reason is that though having broad knowledge of many academic subjects, he will work to a filed or organisation where he uses the  knowledge of one particular subject. But not all the knowledge of his all subjects. If he wants to switch over to other filed, he has to work from the begining i.e. like a beginner.

   So i prefer to have broad knowledge in one specific subject to having broad knowledge in many subjects.",0,0.8202633261680603
"Imagine being required to stay in an area for an extended period of time while doing an activity you don't enjoy. That's a large amount of students who could feel this way while engaging in an extracurricular activity. Some people would like to use their time according to their agenda. Students shouldn't have to be required to participate in after school activities because they need to decide how to spend time. Additionally, reasons could include, finishing homework, disliking activities, or wanting to go home. Finishing homework could be a major factor in why students would not like to attend after school programs. Because students often get large quantities of homework, they may want to finish it before participating in extracurricular activities so they don't have to worry about missing or unfinished assignments. Specifically, if a student wants to get their homework done, the programs would shorten the amount of time to finish their homework. This could also increase the stress put on a student from not having enough time to complete their work. Some students may not want to engage in extracurricular activities simply because they don't have the time to finish all assignments afterwards. Another reason why people may not want to participate in after school programs could be that it does not seem enjoyable to them. It is unreasonable to do something you do not like because you could end up seemingly wasting your time for a grade. Adding on, some individuals may already be enrolled in other programs, they essentially would have to do multiple activities that can easily use their precious time. A handful of kids could also prefer to engage in a non related school event. Perhaps it'd be a tradition for a culture or activities that the school does not offer. Lastly, a large amount of people just want to go home. Everyone needs to spend some time alone at some point. It is justifiable for students wanting to go home due to them not being able to relax in a school environment. People wouldn't be able to go to work and relax as if they would at home. It is also fact that kids would like to go home because they cannot stay in an area they don't want to be in. An example would consist of; someone staying at their work place for an extended period of time. Everyone wants to go home at some point for various reasons. While extracurricular activities may be beneficial for a students health, many would not want to participate for lots of reasons. Students shouldn't have to do an after school program because it reduces the amount of time they have to finish an assignment, which could cause stress. Some people may also dislike the activities the school offers, while others could already be in a program outside of school grounds. Overall, many kids just want to go home after school and not do extra work. It is inappropriate for people to relax at school like they would at home. Therefore, students shouldn't have to participate in after school events because they need to decide how they want to spend their own time.",0,0.8161465525627136
"The Effects of Driverless Cars Driveless cars are they safe, or dangerous? Are google car creaters putting us in danger by creatiing a new and improved car that does not require a driver? Some people believe that the diverless car is a danger to it's passengers. While others think that the diverless car is a wonderful idea and can't wait to have it. I believe that diverless cars are a danger to us, and that cars should not be run by technology. We should always have full control of the car just incase something goes wrong and we need to make a quick reaction to whats up ahead.Technology can run slow, we could be driving and the car technology just cut off. I think that there are to many risks in driving a driverless car. It's better for the drivers and the passengers for us to be able to have control of the car. For example google car creator say "" Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with traffic issues."" Someone could not be paying attention and then technology gives the driver control. The driver could get into an accident, because he didn't know he had control and thought the technology did. Others might think diverless cars are a great idea and think that they are safe in some ways. For example google cars creator says "" drivers can still steer, accelerate, and brake themselves."" ""and all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills."" This shows that you will always know when you need to take over the car. The car also has seats that vibrate in danger of backing into and object, the car announces when you need to prepare to take over, and cameras to make sure that you stay focused on the road ahead. ""While the driver whatches the road, the car watches the driver."" Technology is not always 100% working all the time or always right. Nobody can trust technology all the time. All of our creations no matter how much we improve, or how much work and technology we put into it, there are always flaws just waiting to happen. Technology is not perfect, so we need to stop treating it like it is. Driverless cars are they safe or dangerous, should we even risks it?",0,0.7431488633155823
"Seagoing What? Well if you think that the Seagoing Cowboys is bad well, let me tell you about it! See the Seagoing Cowboys program is that 1945, World War 2 was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more. 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA.UNRRA hired Seagoing Cowboys to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. So Luke Don signed up! In Augest 1945, they received their orders to report to New Orleans. It took about two weeks for them to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to gt to China. Caring for the animals during the crossings kept Luke busy. But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him. The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for just a small-town boy. In the Seagoing Cowboys, you can go on avdentures and visit many unique places. I know in your opinion that its a lot of work but you need work to get things and go to places that you want to go. So thats all i have to say. I hoped that you liked my essay!",0,0.5504587292671204
"The Creation of the Thing ""Hold on! Can we actually ""calculate"" emotions-- like math homework?"" do you think that using a computer to deturmane our feelings is right? To me thats cool, maybe even unbelievable. Is the use of computers,emotions,and muscles the key to feelings. Many people can't seem to find what feeling mona lisa is showing, sometimes you cant see what emotion your friend is having. Two professors have decided to invent a software which it can detect the feeling of a person or a painting. stated in paragraph 1, "" the software is the lastest innovation from prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, working in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam. Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate."" This shows that the professors are trying to invent and new and improve way to figure out emotions within the human and paintings. They are creating a software for the computers. Also stated in paragraph 3, "" The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscle."" Not only can the computer detect the feelings, it also makes a 3-D form of the human face or a 3-D image of the painting. Everyone has emotions but some you just cant tell how they are feeling, well now you might not have to worry about that i do believe that this software is going to be very valuable to the students, in very many ways. its going to help them with observing the way the looks and creses in the face is. Stated i paragraph 3, "" Eckman has classified six basic emotions-- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness."" There are many emotions but these are the most common. Also stated in paragrapgh 4, "" In a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emmotions."" No matter what the person is feeling. if they feel sad, worried and happy all at once the software can still detect the emotions of this human or painting. You know that it takes so many muscles just to frown, so why not smile it takes why less muscles. just by muscles you can tell the way someone is feeling. when someone is happy they get wrinkles by their eyes. Stated in paragraph 7, "" In the real smile, the zygomatic major (muscles that begin at your cheek bones) lift the coners of your mouth."" with just useing a couple of muscles it can add a whole different facial expression. Like if you sqint your eyebrows and then also smile and also close your eyes a little bit I know that i wouldn't be able to tell weather they were happy or angry. just by changing on muscle movement it can change the facial expression. Also stated in paragraph 8, "" But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" not only is this cool but its differentuse one other different muscle and people can tell that your smile isnt really and happy smile. This software is a great idea to help many people just understand the emotion of others with the knowledge of computers, emotions, and muscles they will be able to know how anyone is feeling just by the three main reasons.",0,0.7785536050796509
"In today's world it is a debate if knowing more is better or specializing in a subject is better. To specizlize in a subject may make you an expert about that subject but knowing little from every subject makes you only knowledgable to some degree. Therefore the decision may depend on which one you value most. 
	I would value to be an expert in my field. Knowing just a little about all subjects may give you the opportunity to talk about everything but when it comes to talking deeply, for example when somebody asks you about an important part that does not stand on surface, you may not be able to provide any answers. If you are specialized in the subject you will be able to give the answer. So having a broad knowledge of every subject may lead not knowing any subject fully. And if you have missing knowledge about that subject, I think if is better not to talk.  You may be able to talk about the subject but when it comes to academic speechs, where you should show your knowledge about the topic, you may fail to give enough information.
	In my opinion if a person talks about a specific question he must be knowledgable about all aspects of the question. To be able to give specific and not very known facts is more important than repeating the facts that are known by many people. I think repeating would be what the ones who are not specialized in a subject will do. 
	Moreover, today's society gives more credit to specialized knowledge in work environments. Firms usually prefer to hire people that completed the undergraduate level and also completed a graduate level which had given them the opportunity to specialize in their subject. The ones who successfully completed a graduate degree, who are knowledgable about all aspects of their field of study, become the ones who are most valued in the work place. They can find jobs more easily and they are paid more. For these reasons people try to specialize in a specific subject rather than having a broad knowledge of many academic skills.   
	I would like to enjoy better working environments with earning more money and I would like to be able to talk about every aspects of my subject. For these reasons I think specializing in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge about many subjects.",0,0.8520408272743225
"What is that thing on Mars? Well, some people believe that it was something made by aliens. I am here to prove that it was not. The thing on Mars first was photographed in 1976. It is a huge rock formation that resembles a human face. There are shadows that give it the illusion that it has eyes, a nose, and a mouth. Some believe that it is real evidence that there is life on Mars, well it is not. On April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over the ""Face."" The new cameras snapped a photograph that was ten times sharper than the original one. The new image revealed that it was a natural landform. Some skeptics said that maybe the alien markings were hidden by the clouds, but in 2001 a newer image was taken. This image was captured on a cloudless day, so there was nothing obstructing the view. This image also shows that the presumed face was a landform, and not the ancient work of aliens. So, in conclusion, the famous face on Mars was a natural landform. This is supported by the pictures taken in 1998 and 2001. The image captured in 2001 could also possibly see other objects if there were any. So, the face not a sign of life on Mars.",0,0.6719415783882141
"Some know think venus is not a planet. Some know venus is a planet but we all can agree that it is very intresting but why would we use resources to get to venus here are some reasons why and not allow me to show you if it,s worth it. venus is not the farthest planet it is actually not too far so it makes it a viable option. The only thing is is that we have not been able to examine venus with amount of distance between earth and venus which doesn,t give us a lot of options but here is what we do know. First of all venus is known as earths twin and it,s not called earths twin for no reason. Venus is the same size and density which would make it more acustomed to our way of liveing. sometimes venus is actually even the closest planet so if we timed it right it would make it less the journey. The only things is not a single unmanned ship has not survived for more than a few hours when sent to venus. Basically this tells us at the moment that mars is a more viable option because we have actually landed unmanned ships on it to collect data this is why many people talk about mars instead of venus. Some problems that get in our way is the air venus has a thick atmosphere 97 percent is carbon dioxide. Not only that but venus atmosphere has highly corrosive acid the eviorment is much more harsh than earth. This means that it will be a long time before we get to venus are bodies have adapted to earth over the years but it took over 2000 years for us to adapt to this level we can,t wait that long. Our savior nasa is actually coming with ideas to get us there at the moment they have been thinking of makeing blimp like vechile which will hover and fly high to avoid storms and what not. Though it would still be hot but the air pressure is close enough to sea level. What to expect from nasa in the furture a blimp that might make us be able to get more data from venus. Maybe one day we will be able to inhabit venus with the ideas they are coming up with. The fact of the matter is that it,s going to a long time until we get their. So it seems mars is the better option for now.",0,0.8425556421279907
"The new age of technology demands something refreshing and new every day,with new cellular phones coming out nearly every six months, such things are expected. However people who enjoy driving as a sport or even a pasttime are not going to be able to enjoy such things with cars that can drive themselves and the inevitability that roads will be a collective of such things. If they can make special roads; like how General Motors created a concept car that could run on track charged with an electrical cable, there should be an on/off switch for this kind of driving as well as things that are restricted to human drivers only. These things will create a kind of harmony between the two groups of people. However if this alternitive can't be met then self-driving cars should be eradicated as an idea until it is completely safe. To many dangers are posed if we mix the kinds of cars anyway,all it takes is one person to create a wreck, And such things should be avoided at any chance given. Nobody needs to danger more lives than humans do on the highway. We could always put money into better things. The joy of driving is to great for alot of people to give up driving on a daily basis.

"having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects seems more interesting than specializing in only one subject,however, we ought to determine all the advantages and inconvenients to make our mind,


I am convinced about the great importance of mastering at least several subjects in order to increase our general knowledges, It seems nowadays indispensable to be aware of a lot of subjects that belong to varied 
for example, we are to be able to talk about politics,ecology,communication and business,and this would not be possible if we did not get broad knowledge in history, biology or mathematics,If not, we will not feel concerned about very important subjects that are part of our life,
That the reason why we need to accumulate a lot of knowledge while we are still in college,

After being part of this learning process, and only after that, you will be able to choose one specific subject that corresponds truly to your personality, your skills and your motivation.Then, you might be further in the subject you have chosen to express yourself in the best way,
Whether if you were previously not interested in other general subjects, I am afraid that it would be difficult to envision things in a very mature and complete way,

to conclude, you should have a look around you to be open6minded whatever your speciality may be in order to be able to use a wide range of skills,",0,0.8021807074546814

You have spent countless hours on a plane and first thing when you land you find out that you have to stay in the airport even longer just due to the fact the the smog outside is too bad. We must limit are car usage. Therefore showing us the advantages of doing so. Source 1 - in a place called Vauban, Germany they have said there goodbyes to cars. As driveways and home garages are mostly forbidden. The outcome has familes saying 'when i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way'. Also earth is are home. Why would should we all sit back and see are selfs destroy everything we bulit. The more cars we have and use the more damage we do on the earth. Cars have a huge part in the earths greenhouse gas. In Europe greenhouse emissions are up to 12%. In the United states greenhouse gas emissions are up to a bone crushing 50%. Source 2 - Due to all the greenhouse gas after almost record breaking pollution, Paris had to do something about the smog. They set a law that only even numbered license plates were allowed to leave there home on mondays and odd numbered on the next day. That may have lead to some problems such as late to work...ect. But after five days the smog was down 60%. We all have are reason to useing a car,truck,ect. but too much use can lead to problems that we are faceing right now.

"The United States is a government that is ruled by the people through elected representatives, but do the citizens really have power? The Electoral College proccess does not give the citizens all of the power that they shoud be entitled to. ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" (p10) If a United States citizen wanted to vote for a certain candidate, they would vote for electors pledged to that candidate instead of directly voting for them. As a government who is ""run by the people"", the government surely has strict power over things that should be left up to the people to decide. The eloctoral college is unfair and quite confusing to the citizen of the United States. For example, one candidate beats another by a long shot with popular vote but the other candidate wins by electoral votes, the people still have not chosen the representative. The popular vote would bring honesty to the claim that we have a government who is run by the people. A change to the election of the president by popular vote might, in fact, cause some differences and tension across the United States but would cause more relief than it would tension. The people are tired of this out dated process and demand power. Many citizens no longer vote because they think their vote does not count, that it is all up to congress and electors in the end. If the way of popular vote were to be set in place, many people would begin to vote again and would be fullfiling their civic duty. More and more people are begining to have negative feelings towards the government and many feel like their opinions do not matter and that nothing is going to change, that it only gets worse. If enough people come togeher, we can change this old and unfair way of voting and everyone's opinions could make a difference in our nation. ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a politican prefrence..."" (p23) The electoral College is not a democratic way of voting because you are not voting for a president, you are voting for elctors who in turrn, will vote for the president they want despite the people's vote. The trust that the electors will vote for the party's nominee is rarely betrayed but is still a possibility. The winner-take-all system is in each state and candidates only focus on the ""swing states"". For example, in the 2000 campaign, seventeen states did not see candidates. Voters in 25 media markets did not see campaign ads. Popular voting will erase the unfair quality of our presidential elections and bring democratic ways back to the USA. In conclusion, ""The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" (p14) The process in which a president is elected by popular votes is much more feesable and democratic. Many more citizens will be more likely to vote under this process thus partionally bringing the nation closer to where it should be in the modern term of democracy.",0,0.7383434176445007
"Dear Principal, I think that we should be able to bring our phone to school and use them during lunch time and other free time, Because we get in trouble, Because we have them out so there for we in trouble if we get caught with our phones out at lunch, and we do not like getting our phone took up, its best that we should be able to have our phone out during lunch. I think we should be allowed to have our phone out at lunch any way. Like what of we need someone to bring some thing from home but we get caught with our phones, So there for we should be able to have our phones out during our free time. The only time we should have our phones out is during lunch time, but when time to go from lunch all phone should be turned off. Having our phone out at lunch is a privilege though. You have to be a good student to have your phone out, and your grades have to be up.

"Dear Principal, I think that Policy 1 is the best choice for our school. it seems like there is a lot of time throughout the day that there is free time. and instead of sitting around in your class doing nothing. why not be on your phone? also at lunch it seems very acceptable to be able to use your phone. lunch is your personal time to eat and socialize with your friends. it should also be aloud that you should use your phone. Now, kids still use there phones they just have to try to hide it from there teacher. and the teacher has to spend class time taking phones and giving lectures to the person that was caught with the phone. I think that if policy 1 was chosen the amount of kids using there phones in class would greatly decrease. Because if kids knew that they could get on there phones during times like passing period and lunch. then they would not have a reason to have to be on there phones during class time, and in turn, kids would focus better in class. It wouldn't be taking up class time, if kids could use there phones during there free time. there would be no harm in allowing students to use there cell phones during time that is already meant to be the students personal time. In a workplace, cellphones are not banned. and since school is basically a students workplace. then the same rules and freedoms should apply. Even most teachers check there phones throughout class. i think that if the teacher can have time to take away from teaching there students, because they need to get on there phones. the student should be able to use there phones during time that would not affect anyone else, because it is there personal time. Most students use there phones to communicate with there parents during school. if there something the parent needs to tell there kid. for example, that they need to ride the bus because the parent wont be able to pick them up. a cell phone would help a lot in a situation like that. I don't think there is any reason that kids should not be able to use there cellphones during free time. i think that if its free time it should be the kids choice what they want to do with it. there are also a lot of days throughout the school year. that they are purely fun days. well during those days where we are watching movies just to kill time. i don't see any reason why we shouldn't be able to use our phones. rather then watch a animated movie because the teacher had nothing planned.",0,0.844315230846405
"Have you ever seen something so strange that you don't know if you should belive if its real, or just normal? Well NASA has, and if you believe ""aliens"" made the rock on Cydonia you shouldn't and heres why. Twenty five years ago from May 24, 2001, one of NASA's viking spacecrafts were taking imgaes of Cydonia trying to find a spot for Viking 2 to land. While doing so it snapped an imgae of a rock that had shadows acrross it that made it look like a face and eyes stairing back at you.. Some believe ""aliens"" formed this rock, while others believe that it is natural and formed naturally. If you believe ""aliens"" formed this rock here are some reason why you shouldn't. If the rock formation was really formed by aliens, then NASA would of announced it and would of got a lot of fame and credibilty out of it for discovering life on Cydonia. NASA would also be able to see in the images with there were moving objects, or shacks and things on the gorund in the images taken. These types of rocks are common in Cydonia. If the formation was made by aliens then NASA would of proven this and gotten a lot of fame out of it to help the buiness. Proving there is life on Cydonia would give NASA a good look or name. As stated in the passage "" We photographed the Face as soon as we coud get a good shot"". Also stated in the passage NASA pulished the first picture a few days after it was taken. Here is another reason why you should believe it was not alien made. NASA would of been able to see movement or shacks in the images taken on the Face. They would of been able to see landed airplanes or shacks on the grounded. Stated in the passage ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixels size."" ""So if there were object in this picture like airplnes on the grounded or Egyptian-style pyramind or even small shacks, you could see what they were"" Next i will give you the finale reason you should believe the rock in natural formed. These types of rocks are common in Cydonia. The picture shows a rock common in Cydonia like Martian messas or butte landforms. How we know they are common here is in the passages it states"" Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual SHADOWS that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah' it also says ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian Equivalent of a bute or mesa- landforms common around the American West"" These are the top three reasons why you should believe that the rock was a natural landform.

"School is one of the most important aspects in life. It provides many opportunities for jobs and occupations. Lately, students have been asking questions about how schools should offer online learning as an option, so students wouldn't have to show up for school. Even though waking up to go to school can help train for a job-like environment, going to school can cause students to be drowsy in the morning for their first lecture. Students would benefit from being able to attend class from home because students will be able to focus more without their peers distracting them, students will be awake now that they do not have to wake up early in the morning, and students will have all their assignments and homework online. Attending class from home would benefit students because students will be able to focus more without their peers distracting them. In every classroom, there would be at least one student talking which can be distracting to others. For instance, when the teacher is covering a topic that is very crucial in the curriculum, there would be side conversation that would distract the students from learning. If this was the case in every classroom, then online courses would benefit students from these distractions. School starts early in the morning, and students are usually tired around that time and can not focus. Online school would usually start around when students wake up naturally. As a result, this solves the problem of students being tired. Many students head start to their job after school and don't come back home until late at night. This causes them to be tired in the morning at school. Students that take online learning can benefit from it because they will have all their assignments online. When students, in school, do not turn in their homework, they will always have an excuse for not turning it in. For example, students will tell their teachers that they didn't receive one, or they didn't know there was an assignment or homework. In online courses, all assignments are online, so students can not have an excuse for not turning it in. Online learning is beneficial and should be an option in every school worldwide. It benefits students because students will be able to focus more without their peers distracting them, students will be awake now that they do not have to wake up early in the morning, and students will have all their assignments and homework online. In conclusion, students would benefit from online learning instead of going to school.",0,0.81215900182724
"I believe that age doesn't matter when it comes to enjoying life, it is up to each person to make the best of it and squeeze every drop they can get. Sometimes when we are young we tend to think that old people had their time and that because they are so worried on their grandchildren, the cold weather, money problems or about their health problems they don't enjoy life the way young people do. We believe that age is everything until that a day comes when you look back and think of the great memories you have and the great ones that will still come.  

My grandmother was a great example. She always used to tell me what her life was like when she was a little girl growing up in a small town and moving to a big city, going out with her firends, her curfew and when my grandpfather proposed. I thought about how great her life was but never thought about how great her life is. Since we see the present as something common and even unrelevant sometimes I didn't see my grandmother's life as ''exciting'' let alone fun when she was 60. Now, after many other conversations, I got to know that life goes on and that every day is enjoyable, even if it's your last. My grandmother goes away on field trips with her friends while I am studying for a never ending test, cooks because she wants to and not because she HAS to, has great stories to tell and always waits for us with a great meal.   

Enjoyable gets a different meaning while you are growing up. When you're little an ice cream and your mom is everything. When you get older a toy or a new friend is very important; when you're a teenager  enjoying life is having friends around you and have something you can identify with like sports; by college the challange of living alone, traveling, going out to clubs and having a boyfriend/girlfriend is enjoying your youth. By the time you graduate hopefully you'll get a good job, marry the man of your dreams and watch your kids grow up. Every step of the way is enjoyable then. In my opinion there are no times when you enjoy things more than others, it's up to you to make every effort for every moment to be worthy and worthwhile.",0,0.8675078749656677
"The author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable because some computers can give you wrong information. you cant always rely on a software. In Paragraph 7, it says "" your PC cant handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile. but we can write down some simple instructions that ""encode"" different emotions, i really think technology is doing the work for us. We need to take time and do it ourselves and expressing our own feelings because sometimes when you actually happy you got a natural mean mug. The software is going to get the wrong information when it tries to figure out our feelings. moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. making faces cant reveal so much about the science of emotions.

"Dear Principle, I think that you should require all of the student body and your self perform community service. I think this because everybody should be willing to help our homes and town. This could help us. first we could get publicity and we will be good neighbors even make friends, Second we could all get active, Third it will help our environment, Last when were helping we could also be having fun. First, if we all get out there and help I'm sure you will meet a lot of new people. Even make friends also you can make a good reputation for yourself. If we all get together and help eventually you will have tons of friends and partners in life. Second, Every one complains about weight issues. If everyone got out there and helped work they/you will loose body fat and get muscle. So you would be helping the environment and also get a size 6 waist. Or if your a boy/man you can get the body of your dreams by getting out and helping. This will help the world and help you at getting a date. Third, Everyone at one point wants to help animals. Well if you/we do community service you/we would be picking up trash and other things. Animals eventually eat trash and choke on it and die painfully. If we got all of the trash up then animals would be not dying for that reason. Also planting trees and flowers will help the environment, animals, and you/us by giving us oxygen and by making soil easier to grow in and by giving animals food and/or places to live. Last, you could be cleaning out your favorite lake or pond that can be fun if you love the water. Or clean up your favorite place to play outside. I'm sure you at least have one. In conclusion community service is a good thing it can help you, your body, the environment, and animals. That's why (principle) you should let us do community service.",0,0.8008497357368469
"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author descrides the exploration and study of Venus as a worth while pursute and advancement in the Scientific field. Venus itself being a planet that is untouchable to humans or anything of this world most certainly holds many mysteries that would be amazing if where solved, but, besides that should we be putting any of our hard earned money, limite time, or reasources that could be used else where into the study of some uninhabitable planet. The author ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" never made a clear reason as to why we should care throughout his entire article. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author shows a clear, all out passion torwards the study of the molten planet. While having passion is important so is having a valid reason as to why others should care but instead the closest to any sort of valid reason we get is ""to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight gained on the planet itself, but also human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors,""(paragraph 8, The Challenege of Exploring Venus). Human curiosity is an amazing thing and it's an outstanding ability that we posses, not to mention some of the worlds greatests discoveries started of as just someone being curious about something but ultimately this exploration is proving to be incredibly expensive and without significant results. We have people dying everyday from things such as deseases or injuries and many of the reasources that are poured into finding out whatis on Venus, if there actually is anything at all, could be use more effectively for a different cause. In conclusion the author of the given article has done an outstanding job at not showing how this is useful or worth anything all. While, yes, the author gave us a clear description of the troubles they where facing in their task none of these struggle seem to be worth what we are paying to possible find nothing useful.

"In my personal experience, I have traveled both in a group led by a tour guide, and in a group with out a tour guide. I think that one of this experince is better and fun. Next I will comparate this two situations.

   If you travel whit a tour guide, then you don`t need to search maps, itineraires and local information, because the tour guide will have all the things that you migth need on a trip, this is a possitive sigth of traveling with a guide. But also travel with a guide means that you are not owner on you schedule, because you need to follow the itinerary of  travel agency. For example, when I went to Brasil with my class, I had to do all the things that the tour guide tell us to do, so we can`t decide wich restorant pick for lunch, or with Pub to go on  nigths.

   On the other side of the coin, if you travel by yourself, with out a tour guide, then you can do all the things that you want to do, for example, if you wish to sleep all the afternoon on the beach on Rio de Janeiro, you can do it; or if you want to spend one entierely day on just one place, you can do it too. But such as the first position (travel WITH a guide tour), travel with out a guide implies some problems, for example: where can I change money?, where can I register in?, How much should I pay for a suvenir?.

Though the author also states that some of these methods can be costly and impratical. I think that driverless cars should not be developed further. For the reason that it would be much safer with drivers and we do not need to change much then. With a driver behind the wheel, the driver would be much more effective at keeping themself safe. The driver can see the oncoming cars, traffic, or construction and avoid them. The driverless car could possibly not be aware of some of these conditions and then wreck the car. The sensors on the driverless car could also malfunction while driving and result in the same effect. The driver could just work around all of it and not have to rely on their car to keep them safe. The author even states that right now these situations require human skill rather than the car doing it all. If we were to have these driverless cars, we might have to change the roads to allow these to work. Changing all the roads to work with these cars would be very costly and take quite a while to finish. We also have to worry about putting new laws into place about safety. Like the author says, if someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer. Would the driver be at fault because they were in the car, or would the manufacturer be at fault because the car's technology failed? To conclude, the driverless cars should not be further developed. They could potentially put a person in danger, they would not be very cost effective, and a lot would need to be changed. We do not need to change if we already have a system that works well for the most part. The driverless cars would be pointless.",0,0.7314974069595337
"I believe that driverless cars could be something useful for the future. It could greatly benefit us in many ways, which is something I think we could use in our economy right now. I believe the cars will benfit us in many ways. First of all, it uses less fuel to run on which would save resources and help less money to be spent. I believe it would help keep our environment cleaner in that way. Second of all, I have a feeling there would be a lot less accidents with the driverless cars once they get all the sensors figured out. I believe there would be less accidents because nowadays people aren't paying attention when they're driving anyway. They are typically texting. With the driverless cars this would allow for the drivers to no thave to worry about taking their eyes off the road. However, there is the problem of having the texting being taken advantage of and therefore increasing the accidents; when the driverless cars need the driver to navigate the driver wouldn't be paying attention and instead would be texting. Also, as paragraph nine says, eventually when we get the law figured out and people realize that that these caras are safe then laws will be passed and driverless cars will help people in many ways. In conclusion, I do believe this will work once they get all the puzzle pieces fitting together. Driverless cars would be safer, and less detrimental to our ecosystem.",0,0.8873417973518372
"Summer projects or summer assignments are projects or assignments that are given to students over the summer to help them remember what they've done the previous year. The assignments may also prepare students for what they will learn in the upcoming year. That being said, summer projects or assignments should be teacher-designed rather than student-designed because it'll better prepare them in the upcoming class, teachers know the subject matter better than students, and because teachers will make it education a priority. The first reason on why summer assignments should be teacher-designed is that it will better prepare them in the upcoming class. As said above some assignments prepare students for the upcoming year. The assignments show the students what they might be working on at the beginning of the year. They show the students on what they might need to touch base on or review before coming to class. A student-designed summer assignment wouldn't be able to do that because the student doesn't know the specifics of what they will be learning in the upcoming class. They might know the basics because of a previous course but they will not be able to prepare themselves for new material like a teacher can. Another reason why summer assignments should be teacher-designed is because the teachers know the subject matter better than students do. Teachers have gone through high school and college, they have degrees in the subject they teach. Summer assignments should be about the subject you're learning. A student would not know more than a teacher because they haven't went through the necessary training or certifications to become a qualified teacher. Teachers know more than students so the summer assignment would be better made by the teacher who knows the subject matter better than the students. Teachers also know what to give to students over the break. It is a well thought out plan and it has to be a good one so they can use it again in future years. While some people agree with the idea of having teacher-designed summer projects, there are some people who don't. Others believe that summer projects should be student-designed because they are the students and they should dictate what they do over the summer because it's exactly that: summer. They feel as though students shouldn't be brought upon the heavy workloads teachers would give them, instead create their own assignment for each class to assure that they are still learning while not having as much work. Although that is a good argument for why summer assignments should be student-designed, there are other factors that go into it. Some teachers may give lots of work over the break but it is all for a good cause: better education. Education is the number one priority in a teachers eye. When teachers give lots of work over the break they are assuring that you are learning while still having fun over the summer. When students go back to school after a long break rather than not knowing or remembering any of the course material, students will be better prepared because of all the work given over the summer. The debate about wether or not summer projects or assignments should be teacher-designed or student-designed is wildly spread in the world. Summer assignments should be teacher-designed because it'll better prepare the students in the upcoming class, teachers know the course material better than the students, and because teachers make education a number one priority.",0,0.7457395792007446
"The number of cars on our planet is a very important problem but we are moving on the right direction and i think in the next twenty years will be fewer cars in use than there are today.
  The first point to support this opinion is that the oil is going to finish in not a long time and still now there aren't other tecnology as efficent for cars.Therefore to use cars will be more expensive and less people would pay for that.
  Another point is the air pollution caused by cars.Infact the environment is damnaged by cars and to solve this problem the solution is to reduce the number of cars on the Earth.
  Finally the pubblic tranports are becoming more efficent and there are a lot of projects to construct new metropolitan line, railways station and to increase the number of buses, so iwill be more easy and fast to use pubblic transport.Also the flights by planes are going to become more cheaper in the next twenty years and they will to cover more short distance lines, so an increasing number of people are going to use often the plane instead than cars.

"While it is true that some people prefer not to take risks and experiment new things, someother believe that only  those who dare exploring the unknown and continously improving themselves can acheive ""success"". I think that the successful people are required to try new things and take risk, because their knowledge may get outdated in a short time.
Let's take the example of fashion. Fashion is continously shifting and it is always changing according to the mass requests. If a successful stylist would persist producing the same kind of products after a fashion shift, he would bankrupt in no time as noone would be interested.
Other cases of successul people can be scientist: what would be of humanity if scientist didn't make their experiment or tried unbelievable theories? The whole science is a always-changing subjuct as modern science differs heavily from just 50 years ago science. In this very field we have great names such as Heinstein who carried out his experiment of the relativity in phisics, or Bell who could invent the phone only by trying different hypothesis in the radiowaves sector.
One of the most striking example is the technology field, especially the computer evolution: computers power doubles every 18 months, and the software is always more and more hungry of resources. Would you consider possible some of the great mathematics achievement, or, on the other hand, some befautiful 3D film, without the growing calcolus power of the computer, obtained by continued research? In this field as well we can hear very big names, like Bill Gates, Steve Jobbs or Linus Torvalds, who were enabled to provide us with their great operating systems (Microsoft Windows, Apple MacOs X and Linux) only by going against what they already knew and trying hard new solutions.
In conclusion, the key for success is obtainable only by hard work in experimenting new theories and only by will to continue renewing oneself's knowledge.",0,0.847152829170227
"I agree with the statement ""It is more important for atudents to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts""
Here are a few ponits to impress upon this statement.
First, understanding the concept of a particular idea in a subject  provides the student with a not only with clear and strong foundation in that particular subject matter but also enhances and expands their creative aptitude. 
For example understanding the concept of the physical formula v = u+at (where v=final velocity; u= initial velocity; a=acceleratoin and t=time) allows the student to apply the formula to numerous problems in linear motion.As such, the knowledge gained will allow the student to tackle the problem, however varied its presentation may be.
Secondly, in the feild of medicine, understanding the concept of the cell cycle and mechanisms of tumor spread allows doctors to apprppriately plan the best mode of treatment that they can give to their patients afflicted with cancer, such as radiotherapy, or cell-cycle specific/non-specific chemotherapy.
Also understanding of the concept is important in that knowing the concepts will in itself obviate the need to remember certain hard facts and figures.  For example, the value of ""Pi"" can be easily derived in problems ifd we remember that it is only the circumference of a circle divided by its diameter, rather than remembering all the digits.
To conclude,  though facts are important in many ways such as historical dates and events, (in such circumstances, they are unavoidable) they are more cumbersome and less useful in lerning especially in the sciences. Allowing the student to try and understand concepts and ideas will only help him expand his intellectual horizon and creativity as",0,0.7758530378341675
"Being a Seagoing Cowboy was one of the best times of Luke's life. He got to travel the world and explore. And he got to help people around the world. Paragraph 3 tells us about how in August 1945, Luke received orders to go to New Orleans. He arrived Agust 14, 1945. There Luke got my seaman's papers and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster headed for Greece. On the ship were a 335 horse cargo with hay and oats to feed them. In paragraph 4 we learn that Luke turned 18 before he made it to Greece. This meant he was able to be drafted for military service, but his draft board said that he should just keep the service he already had. Luke was discharged in 1947, but he had made nine trips by that time, the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. Not only did Luke help people, but he also got to see Europe and China. Paragraph 5 tells us how Luke got to see the Acropolis in Greece and how he take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. Being a Seagoing Cowboy was a lot more than an advemture for Luke.

"While this technology may seem like a minor addition to the classroom, the data it produces is worth a lot to ensuring that the student is having the best possible experience in the classroom. Most students in general find school to be boring. This technology is able to reverse that. With its ability to recognize what some people may not be able to see, it can severely improve the benefits of school, and what the student may get out of it. Emotional expressions can be hard to read for anybody. In fact, some of the most confusing times can stem from not being able to read emotions, whether that your own emotions or someone elses emotions. With this program, that question can be solved with ease. With the knowledge of one's emotions, we are now able to improve are actions to best fit the needs of that particular person. So maybe if one student is struggling, you can now provide the necessary plan to get that student back on track. In some cases, students that suffer from learning disabilities, such as ADD or ADHD, may not recieve the benefits others who don't suffer from these do. With this technology, we may now be able to read their emotions and make the best decsion for this student. It opens the student-teacher relationship to a brand new world, where the teacher can finally help his or her student out in the best way possible. The technology goes deeper than where human emotions can go, which is key in understanding how to help someone be the best they can be. Finally, this technology can give us a better way to help ourselves. People know themselves better than anyone else. With this technology, students are now able to figure out what is best for them, and to find a change if they are unhappy or are feeling troubled in any way. Moreover, sometimes figureing out our own emotions can sometimes be difficult. This provides us with a tool to realize what they truly may be feeling, so that they may be able to get on the right track on improving his or her emotional state. While this technology may seem unimportant, it is key in helping students be the best of themselves. It can provide things that human interaction cannot. Especially as a teenager, emotions are some of the hardest things to deal with. This is able to dampen a little bit of the pain that can come from trying to deal with these emotions, as well as exapanding the benefits of going to school. It utilized correctly, this technology can have a huge impact on the lives of students.",0,0.7818731069564819

One of them is taking care of animals, the other one is having unbelievable trips, the last one is the jobs you do and the free time. The first one were going to talk about are taking care of the animals. When you join the Seagoing Cowboys program you have to care the horses until they go to a different person. Another supporting detail is about the cows, you need the cows to get the milk from or what are the others participates going to drink. The last supporting detail is the mules that were shipped overseas. Those were all the supporting details for the reason about taking care of animals. The other reason that were going to support is the unbelievable trips they travel by. The first supporting detail is about the cattle-boat trips they get when they participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. Also, we get to tour an excavated castle in Crete. they also marveled at the Panama Canal on there way to China. That is another reason why you and the others should participate. The other reason you should join is you got to do many jobs so you won't be bored, and you also get free time. One job you get is being a night watchman you get to check on all the animals every hour. Another one is cleaning up. You have to feed and water the animals two or three times.

"Students should be able to design their own summer projects. I believe that summer projects assigned should be student designed because it would be more freeing to the students if they got to design their own project for the summer instead of a project designed by a teacher. This is a good thing because it's their summer vacation and that should give them the right to decide what project they want to do so they don't feel like the school is control of them even during their summer vacation which often represents the idea of freedom until the next school year begins. My reasoning on this is because it's the students vacation; it would be more fair to the student that they get to design what their project should be so they don't feel like the school is still in charge of them and what they do even while they're on break. I also don't think it would be fair to the teachers either if they were the ones who had to design a project for their students and eventually get bored of grading them because things could get repetitive depending on what the project would be. Some evidence I have for this reasoning is that I know some students that would be stressed out greatly from teachers designing what the students are going to work on over the summer during their vacation; it doesn't matter if the project is difficult or not because they would purely be stressed about the fact that they have a teacher designed project to do over the summer which feels more like schoolwork to do over the summer and that isn't a fun thing to be thinking about over your vacation. I also feel that parents would have complaints to make if their child was being assigned to a summer vacation project that was designed by teachers because that would give them the idea that teachers aren't giving enough freedom to their child over the summer. Though if it was their child designing their project I feel like parents would be more supportive of that because not only is their child still learning during break; but with the student being the one to design the project; that means that it gets the students' creativity flowing which I believe parents would be more supportive of then if teachers were the ones to design the project. While I do know that there would be students and parents who would prefer that teachers would design the projects so the students wouldn't have to think so much about it and just do the project like a lifeless mind slave; I would have to argue back that not only would that cause a block on the students creativity, which is very important, but it would also mean that teachers would have to design a project for all of their students, which is a lot mind you, while trying to make sure that the project would be fitting for each one of their students and I think that's a problem that comes back to the fact that it just wouldn't be fair for teachers to have to do that; especially because they would already be having to grade them; so with the teachers also designing the projects, like I said before, that has a risk of things getting repeated and that could cause the teacher annoyance, a headache, sleep deprivation, etc. I think that if summer projects were to be assigned then students should be the ones designing them. It would boost their creativity as well as their learning because they would be designing the project and doing research for it, It would make the majority of parents happier if they knew that their child wasn't using their summer vacation for completing a project that was designed by a teacher and not their child, and the teachers would be less stressed as well knowing that the outcome of letting students design their summer project would result in more diversity between what the projects were about and would more than likely contain less repetition than they would if the teachers were to design the summer project. It makes more sense to me that the student would be the one designing what project they're going to do during their summer vacation.",0,0.7735728025436401
"Research show that many students dont really like to go to schools that much. Some of them is fro the cause of bulling, dont like to see people that they dont like, which is the the cause that some of students dont really come to school. Is also effective for them and for their future to not attempt to school. Yet some students like to come to school. but sometimes its hard for them to come. But the question is "" Why is it hard?"". Well, research shows that 95% of the students in FCPS dont attempt to school for this type of reason. Some other just dont like to come to school for other many reasons, or some school issues. Having to come to school is a problem for some students, or they just drop out of school for some reason. "" But, why do they drop out of school"". Well, some of them just decide not to come to school for these reasons. They get a job, which makes them loose their focus from school. They dont like some classes, or some people that they have to deal with, in school. They think that school is not as important as how their job is. These are the reasons why some students just decide not o come to schools no more, or just drop out. But, the question is "" Should students receive classes from home using the internet or video conferencing?"". In my opinion, this could be helpful for some students. But, I dont thin k this could be the best idea that schools could have. Nor could be helpful for some. "" But why?"". Well, in this days we can see how technology is advancing in every single corner in the world, and we can also see how is effecting many students around the world. "" But how would these affect them?"". Simple. If students decide to take classes at home by computer or any electronic device aveliable at home. We can tell that they can easily get distracted by any other web. For example, is a students is receiving his classes through out any electronic device aveliable at home, and they get a message or notification from someone, or something. We know that they would want to respond to that massage, and thats going to make them loose their focus from the lesson. Making these type of learning can be helpful for some students and it can also be helpless for other. In other words, there can also be some distraction from other home activities, of other need. So, making these type of learning, In my opinion, is not the best type of learning that schools should give. For example, I cant focus in a lesson when I hear that my phone is ringing, vibrating, or watching it turning on over and over, and I have no doubts that these is one on the reasons why schools should not give these type of learning. Is just not the type of learning that we should get. In conclusion, students should always try to attempt to school, even when they're having some difficult time to stay focus. Even in those moments where there are some people that we dont like to see, and I totally understand that. Because, even I dont like some people in school. But, that does not mean that Im going to quit. "" Why?"". Because God gave every single on us a memory, and we just have to know how to use it. I also say this every time "" quitting is not in my blood. If i fall down 7 times, I would rise up 8 times."", and yeah. This is a long way to go but we dont have to give up. We also have teachers that can help us in any time we need them. We have to try at least. But, my number one rule is ""Dont give up"". We also have God in our side, and he is the only one we need to keep going forward. Schools, teachers, assistance, and students. We have to know that giving students home learning can be useful.

"Innocent and young, children grow accustomed to the utilization of cars in society. Hot Wheelz, battery-powered Barbie SUVs, Hess Semi-trucks, and other deviations of play-friendly cars introduce the car culture to Americans from nearly the first day out of the womb. Mothers, fathers, aunts, uncles, neighbors, and grandparents depend on their cars daily. This reliance on cars consequently impacted America's environment. However, limiting car usage reduces society's carbon footprint, slowly eliminating the encompassing pollution and stress of the developed car culture. All vehicles alike release carbon emissions into the atmosphere, polluting the air and smogging our cities. Suburbs, especially, rely on automobiles to provide needed transportion. Experts state that car transportation in suburbs ""is a huge impediment"" (Source 1) when discussing ""efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes"" (Source 1). In the car-intensive areas of the United States, passenger cars hold responsibility for ""up to 50 percent"" (Source 1) of greenhouse emissions. This constant car usage pollutes American skies. Elisabeth Rosenthal states that car usage reduction ""will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment"" (Source 4), especially in America ""since transportation is the second larget source [of emissions]"" (Source 4). Cutting down on cars for alternative, public, or group transportation provides a solution to the car epidemic of suburban America. In other societies where limitations of car usage occured, the majority of its denizens replied positively. In the car-depleted suburb of Vauban, Germany, ""57 percent sold a car to move [to Vauban]"" (Source 1). The influential idea of a suburb without traffic jams and long drives to stores attracted 5,500 current residents of Vauban. Futhermore, car bans in Paris reduced emissions and cleansed the air ""after days of near-record pollution"" (Source 2) and ""five-days of intensifying smog"" (Source 2). During this ban, ""congestion was down 60 percent"" (Source 2), relieving traffic and pollution. In Bogota, Colombia, a ""car-free day"" (Source 3) promotes ""alternative transportation and reduce[s] smog"" (Source 3). One Colombian businessman commented cheerfuly, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" (Source 3). The relief of traffic results in the relief of stress, which city-drivers appreciate. In America's evolving society, and the evolving global economy, limiting car usage stands benefically. Reducing smog, eliminating the stress of traffic, and preserving the environment, low car-usage societies appeal in all current circumstances. Progressively, the world may see a day where car usage is antiquated.",0,0.9034700393676758
"Whether it is better to travel in a group led by a tour guide or just by your own, has both advantages and disadvantages depending on many factors or characteristics of the trip. Three importants factors are: the amount of money the person has, for how much time he will be travelling, and the personal oppinion about flexibility.
 
	Firstly, hireing a tour guide can be very expensive and, in some cases, much more expensiver that travelling alone. For example, it is free to go through Paris walking on your own, and it can be very expensive to pay for a group tour. Nonetheless, you will probably need to buy a guide if you do not want to miss the important places. It is cheaper to walk on your own only if the guide is not as expensive as the tour.

	Secondly, a guided tour works better for someone who has not got too much time to visit a place. In this case, he will have someone to take him to the unmissable places and to give him some explanations. On the other hand, if someone has, for example, three month to visit two cities, he will probably have time to get around on his own, ask for some advise to different local people and see or visit much more different places than the number of places he would visit on a guided group tour.  

	The third factor has to do with preferences. People have different oppinion about how much flexibility they like to have when they are travelling, and there is not only one correct or a best oppinion. Some people like to have a schedule that details every place they will visit, and what they will do every day. However, other people like to feel free to do what they feel like doing on each day, depending, for example, on their mood. In spite of the fact that a person can make a detailed schedule when travelling alone, on guided tours, people are usually less free to do what they feel like doing on that day. 

	In conclusion, there is not one best way to travel. Everyone can have their own best way depending on their personal characteristics and on the trip they are planning to take. Therefore, each person has to decide whether to travel in a group with a tour guide or by their own.",0,0.6821983456611633
"Have you ever been in a situation where you needed to make a decision that will affect you for the rest of your life? Who did you go to for advice? Making decisions can prove to be very difficult sometimes. Everybody has been in at least one situation where they have to make a very important decision. Many seek advice from multiple other people in order to make the best decision possible. That is the best way to get advice. If someone has gone to multiple people for advice, then the decision they were trying to make was most likely a smart one. Going to multiple people for advice can really help somebody make a logical decision that will benefit them in the future. Seeking advice from more than one person helps people make good decisions because of the information learned from their experiences, their different perspectives on certain issues or ideas, and because it has been proven to help people make smart decisions. Firstly, seeking advice from multiple people leads to great decisions because each person that gives advice will give advice based on their own personal experiences. Assuming that they are of appropriate age, each person that gives advice will have had various work experiences and can offer advice based on those experiences. For example, when in the process of making a decision about whether or not to accept an offer to a job, those pieces of advice from those people can positively impact the decision. Additionally, the people that give advice have usually met a lot of other people and have experience with dealing with them. This is extremely important because advice can be given based on who to avoid and who to talk to. Also, the people who are giving the advice can give details about what has gone wrong at various points in their life. Multiple pieces of information about accidents happening can help keep anyone safe from those vary same situations. The first reason why getting advice from multiple other people can lead to beneficial decisions is because the advice is based on multiple experiences from those people's lives. Furthermore, getting advice from multiple others helps lead to very smart decisions because they can offer wise advice based on their different perspectives. Everyone has been or is being raised differently and has slightly different views on certain issues and topics. When seeking advice from others, it is extremely helpful to be able to learn about the various perspectives of the people giving advice that were built during childhood. Also, other people may have influenced how the people giving advice view things. This means that the advice that is being given is not merely based on the people who are giving advice, but more people who you may not be able to talk to. The people giving advice may also have had teachers, mentors, or professors who have taught them how to view things differently. For example, someone who is seeking advice about which college they should attend might seek advice from people who have been through the process before, because they can offer views on college admission that others may not. The second reason why getting advice from multiple people leads to great decisions and success is because the person seeking advice can be offered a plethora of different perspectives. Lastly, I have witnessed what incredible benefits seeking advice from multiple others has on someone. About one year ago, my brother, Generic_name was just beginning the college application process. He figured out which schools he was going to apply to and he applied to them. He got into five schools, but was torn between his top three schools. Generic_name went to our parents, his old teachers, school counselors, and even coaches for advice. He took notes every time he met with someone and kept it all in a notebook. After about four months, he ended up with a notebook full of advice, stories, opinions, and conversations from all those people that he talked to about college. After reading the notebook, he had pretty much already narrowed it down to one college. Generic_name could not have come to a smart, swift decision if it were not for the many people who gave him their advice. The advice he collected was so incredibly helpful because it was based on the very experiences and perspectives of the people who gave it to him. Had he only been offered advice from one person, he would have made a biased decision that may not have been right for him. Now my brother is attending a great school and is as happy as can be. This just goes to show that going to multiple people for advice is tremendously helpful and has a massive positive impact on the person or people trying to make a decision. Seeking advice from multiple others is one of the best ways to gather extremely helpful insight that will help you make a smart, well thought out decision that will bring great benefits in the future. Firstly, it lets you learn about real experiences that have happened in other people's lives. Next, it helps you see the issue or topic from other interesting, wise perspectives. Lastly, I and many others have witnessed the amazing benefits that it has on people. If you are ever faced with a tough decision, go to multiple people for advice. I am sure that the advice they will give you will be helpful, as it will most likely be based off of experiences and different perspectives. If someone ever comes to you for advice, give them advice that will truly help them and lead them to make a great decision. They will remember and appreciate you for how much you helped them.",0,0.694656491279602
"Teacher-Designed or Student-Designed Summer Projects Summer is a time for students to take a break and relax from school, but many classes are making students preform a summer project. Summer projects are given to students to allow them to continue learning even when not in school. The projects push students to work hard all year long. Summer projects are also easy ways for students to work hard and achieve a great score for classes. If a student does well on their summer project, then the teacher will recognize the student is committed and focused on school even when not in the classroom. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because they will keep the students on task, push the students to learn, and will prepare students for future year long jobs. A reason why summer projects should be teacher-designed is because they will keep the students on task. On the other hand if the project was to be student-designed then students could easily be sent off track. There are a lot of summer activities that students would like to do, and if a student is only focused on fun activities then the student will not focus on the assigned project. The teacher-designed projects will keep the student on task and give them a way to work on the project but still be able to have fun during their summer break. Keeping the students on task is important and not allowing them to push the project off is a great reason why the teacher-designed project is a better idea. Another reason explaining why summer projects should be teacher-designed is because it will push the student to learn. If the students are not learning anything from the project then there would be not reason why to have the project assigned to begin with. The students would learn a lot more if the project was made at a teacher standard because it would be just like a test or classwork, but made into a large project for the student. Learning from the project would be very beneficial for the student because they are given a whole summer to work on the project which allows them to learn the material at a slow and steady pace. This is a great reason why the summer project should be teacher-designed and not student-designed. The last reason why the summer projects should be teacher-designed is because they will prepare the students for future year long jobs. Most jobs are year long and by giving the students the summer projects they are learning what it is it like to work year long. The students are basically going to be working all year long once they are given their summer projects. This is going to prepare them for what it is like to work all year long once they have a job. Even though the students are given a long time to work on the project, and will still have more of a break than a real job would allow, it is still a very good experience for the students. Many teens are hit hard when they leave school and enter into the workforce because school is much easier than a job. The reason just stated is a great example of why the teacher-designed project would be more beneficial to the students. There are many of people that would agree with these statements above, but there would be opposers that would disagree. It is true that if the projects were student-designed then the students could work around their schedules to work on the project. That does seem very nice for the students, but there are many more advantages to the teacher-designed projects. Keeping the students on task, pushing the students to learn, and preparing students for future year long jobs are all reasons why summer projects should be teacher-designed. The projects that students receive now should be teacher-designed. This would make them much better for the students in so many great ways.",0,0.6900129914283752
"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System(FACS) enables computers to identify human emotions, but is it valuable because it can read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. The answer is yes, it is vauable. According to the article, process of FACS begins with the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Then, Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS. Eckman classified the six basic emotions; happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Then, he associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" observes Dr. Huang, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"". So, that mean it works on everybody not just the students in a classroom. Dr. Huang also got help from psychologists, that can classify six basic emotions, because of that, FACS can read people emotions, not just the students. In conclusion, the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in the classroom is valuable, because psychologists helped Dr. Huang create the FACS. It is also valuable, because the facial expressions for each emotion are universal.",0,0.6284478306770325
"The Facial Actione Coding System was built to read the emotions of other people through pictures, such as the Mona Lisa. Although now it is being tested for real life, and on education. In all honesty the program would be great for schools, as they can increase grade rates and help students better understand what they are learning. The FACS can calculate the feelings of students, which mean it knows how the students is feelings towards a certain subject. Dr. Huang states that, ""it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,"" meaning that the FACS can reinvent the lesson in the way the students would best learn it. In years to come, if this experiment were ever tested, it would imporve on grades and give more opprotunities to students who would expect themselves to be failiing instead. This opprotunity is none to waste. If the FACS is predicted to help students focus harder on school then why not try it, if the schools really wanted their children to get better grades why not test the FACS out. The FACS is even proven to read the emotions of Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece, The Mona Lisa, if it can do that it could surely work on a student who is failing and who could increase their grades and welcome more opprotunity got them.",0,0.768190324306488
"Exploring another planet may be fun, but how would you like to live in a different planet? Venus is the second planet from the sun, but it's hard to study this mysterious planet because of the different risk that may be on the planet. Many people have tried to visit this planet but had no success. The reason of not accomplishing this goal is because of the many dangers that are within the planet. Although it may seem fun to go study another planet, some may consider it to be a major risk due to the fact that: It's a new planet with no knowlage of knowing what might happen, high or low tempretures, and challenges that may come to getting to know this planet. Many scientist sent numerous spacecraft to Venus but unfortunetly none has maintaine to last the newly planet for more than a few hours. In the text it states, ""Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades""(The Challenge of Exploring Venus, ph.2). However, people may ask why vist this planet, we have other planets that are more closer. Well studies have shown that Venus is the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. In the text it states, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth""(The Challenge of Exploring Venus, ph.4). So, the only difference of the Earth, and Venus is the tempreture they have. In any planet, you don't happen to know the tempretures in the planet. Many plantes have high or low tempretures, and some may even have toxic air for us humans. In Venus the air is mostly made up of carbon dioxide and corrosive sulfuric acid. In the text it states, ""97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus"" and ""Clouds of highly corrosive sulfic acid in Venus's atmosphere""(The Challenge of Exploring Venus, Ph.3). Wanting to go vistit another planet is meaning having to wear special gear so you dont get sick due to the different air it has from Earth. Furthermore, the text also states, ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet""(The Challenge of Exploring Venus, Ph.3). Having high degrees is very dangerous for us humans, especially if we've never encountered this problem here on Earth. Austrounots are very brave people, they do all these studies for us so we could understan how another planet functions. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) do send humans (Austrounots) to go study Venus, but they don't particuarly land on the planet. In the text it states, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostlie condition on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray""(The Challenge of Exploring Venus). This motion is leting the humans hover over the planet and it helps protect the people from any harmful ground conditions by not touching the planets surface. In conclusion, it is fun to study another planet, yes it may seem harmful but in reality the NASA people do know what they are doing and yes they will watch over you and protect you.

"In our technologicall world, advertisement is the key for the success and development of an old or new product.
You cannot escape the constant presence of advertisement if you live in an average totaly or developped country. You read about it in news, magazines. You hear about it on the radio, on TV, or at the movies. Companies pay fortunes to advertise for their product in such a competitive way that they may override the truth about describing it or their use. I recently saw on TV a program about the president of  a famous soda company whose policy was to keep changing the advertisement of that same product very often to keep the public interested. Part of what is true for each and every add, seem poor when you think about the real benefits of a soda. Caffeine beeing the main incredient, it can keep you energized but does not have the same positive effect  on each one.  My son is one example, if he drinks one of those sodas, he gets really hyperactive, in a negative way.  
Companies in an other hand are practiccally obligated to give information on the product that is not always right, because it becomes competitive with another product. When you think about all the different products offered for your hair, shampoos and such, for which I am very interrested, it becomes impossible to see which one you really want to buy, because they all promise to make your hair beautifull. Where is the truth, once you've tried, you know!

"Dear State Senator, I think that we should not keep the Electoral College and change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. One main reason why i think we shouldnt keep the Electoral College is because the congress men that vote are in replace of us as citizens and our votes. The Electoral College is what we might call the diaster factor. It is unfair to many citizens because democratic electors can easily oppose their vote and vote for a different president. For example, new electors opposed for John F. Kennedy but in reality the vote didnt go to him. Another issue with Electoral College is that voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If we change the system to electing by popular vote everybody will have the right to vote for whom they desire too without having to worry about that their vote may change.

"Should Drivers Use Cellphones While Driving? Cell Phones have become a prominent part of most peoples lives in this contemporary era. Smartphone ownership is growing rapidly around the world. In addition, the worlds population is 7.6 billion with an estimated 1.4 billion cars on the road. That is a vast eighteen percent of the population. This leads to the question, should drivers be able to use cellphones in any capacity while operating a vehicle? I feel as though you should not touch your phone while operating a vehicle. A person is twenty-three times more likely to have a motor vehicle crash while texting and driving. It maybe argued that people need their phones in dire emergencies. This is where the campaign ""It can wait"" comes in and other programs to promote wireless usage (ex. Bluetooth). Thus, ceasing any hands-on phone activity while operating the vehicle. Bluetooth wireless makes things more convenient for vehicle users. Calls, music listening, and more can be accessed using Bluetooth. When texting and driving, your focus is mostly on your phone. Your focus is supposed to be fully on the road. Not only is there traffic, but you also must look out for pedestrians. You must be aware so that you can be able to react quickly to pedestrians that aren't aware and potential accidents (due to poor judgement of other drivers). Knowing and keeping track of your speed and the speed limit is also crucial. You cannot do as listed above when fully submerged in your phone. Additionally, laws are being passed to stop driving and using a cellphone in any capacity of a vehicle. If seen doing so, you will get a ticket. As of July 1st, 2019, this law was put in place in Georgia. You would also receive a moving violation. Moving violations affect auto insurance. While cellphones are very convenient, we must be able to articulate when and where to use them. We are aware of places where they are prohibited (e. g.: court rooms, airplanes, movies) therefore it will take some getting used to not being on your phone at all while driving. It is not impossible, though. We can still receive phone calls, especially those very important ones, of course. As mentioned before, the Bluetooth may be hooked up to your car, therefore one may talk wirelessly whilst driving. The conversation may be heard via speakers in the car. In conclusion, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. It can always wait. Works Cited 1.)

"Should students have to participate in extracurricular activities? I believe extra curricular activies should be required in schools. Extracurricular activities have been proven to benefit students in many different ways. I believe students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students will meet new people, discover new interest, and participate in some friendly competition. First, students can meet new people if they were to do extracurricular activites. If students were in an extracurricular activity then students could see things from other student's perspectives. Seeing things from other student's perspectives might influence students to think differently about something or might let students see something in a way they never had before. Also, if students were to partcipate in extrcurricular activites students could make new friends which improves their social skills. Heightened social skills could help students later in life with things like job interviews, applying for college, and maybe even finding that ""special someone"". Maybe, if students were to meet new people, students could find things that they enjoy about someone else and try to apply that to themselves. For example, maybe someone is filled with charm and they love that about them, so they try to be more charming. Next, students could discover new interest. It is possible that students could find something that they had no idea intrested them. Finding new things about yourself is very beneficial when trying to look for something new. The world would be a very dull place if everyone always did the same thing over and over again. Therefore, students should step out of their comfort zone and try something new every once and a while. Trying out new things might even help students see people and the world differently. Students could learn things about the world that they never thought possible. Lastly, extracurricular activies could promote students to paricipate in friendly competition. A little friendly competition can strive students to do their best. When students give it their all, they usually feel proud about how much effort they put in. For instance, if students do their best, students will feel motivated to work harder and push their limits. Students may set new goals to be the best that they could possibly be. Also, everyone wants to win but friendly competition can teach students that it is okay not to win everytime, which can improve sportmanship. In conclusion, students should participate in extracurricular activities because students will improve multiple skills, they can learn more about themsleves, and students can learn to work well with others. Another point is that, many students do not participate in extra curricular activities. I believe there are multiple reasons why students do not participate, but I think because they take time out of the day and students believe they will not be interesting and that they will not enjoy them are the biggest factors. Therefore, if students are obligated to participate they might change their mind and join more activities as the years go on.",0,0.7714078426361084

"My position on driverless cars is that im against the developing of these car because of what they bring. Things like this would probably cause chaos. More than likely to have accidents and whos fault would it be. Some situations with these driverless cars can also be crutial. Im against it because the laws, what wil happen after a accident, and how these things would actually work. If the law focuses on how safety works and keeping everyone in the car safe, what if theres a malfunction and theres a accident? Then who will get the blame for it? The way it will work is if a human driver is in control right, but then the driverless car looses control or has a breakdown who will be affected? The developer or the ones in the driverless car. The traffic laws are for someone to be in control of the car so therefore it is safe. Maybe a change in laws can solve this problem and conflict that may possibly happen. Accidents happen daily, so will the driverless decrease the chances of that happening? In my opinion is that technology goes wrong here and there not always but it happens. If these cars arent deveoped the proper way where theres accidents daily, who gets the blame. I personally think that the developer and the one who had the idea to make this should take a part in it. Why? Simply because if you took the time to make something so cool and fun, it should also reach state safety laws. When accidents happen and if its the drivers fault they get blamed for it right? So if this driverless car where there is no driver who get the blame for a injury, the driver or manufacturer. How will this driverless car even work or be developed. The car is gonna have a sensor input system to take over when in traffic. Sensors arent really the best thing to have because something can cause it to stpo it from working then what happens there. If you still need to be in the driver seat and paying attention to the road what is the purpose of this developement? It has its own brakes but you can take turns, but cant you do that in a normal car just takes alittle bit more time. This driverless car isnt a bright idea just because of the way it works and the problems it can cause. Im against it because the laws, accidents and what can possibly happen, and the way this technology might take place. States are gonna have to change safety laws which in some the car needs to be proven to be safe. The accidents and the way things will be faced and who will be blamed is gonna be insane in most peoples opinion. The way technology might take place is also gonna be a factor because it can go wrong if not built right.

"Dear Principle, I agree that you should change the school policy so that students should have a B average in order to participate in school activities. I think that it would be a nice change to help students get better grades. It would also help our school to be a better, smarter school. Students would also push themselves so they won't have to face being kicked off their team. If students do not already have a B average then how can they keep up their grades when they are participating in activities? Students need to learn to organize their time between activities and schoolwork. So not only will they learn to organize their time better but they would also be getting better grades. If you change the policy then many students will be willing to push themselves for better grades so they can participate in school activities. The students who are very dedicated to the sport or activity that they love would definitely push themselves for better grades. I believe that some of the students who participate in the activities at our school do not have a B average. Most likely because they are so dedicated to their sport that they forget about the schoolwork. If one of these students found out that you are changing the rule then they would change their attitude towards school so that they will not get kicked off their team. Our school would be a smarted school if all the students participating in school activities all had B averages. There are a lot of students in our school's activities so if all of them had at least a B average that would be very impressive. We would not only be smart but look smart to other schools. Parent would want to send their children to out school. That would be pretty awesome. I think it would be best if you changed the school policy to where all students need a B average in order to participate in sports. It could really help out our school and out students. Most kids will be doing better in school and would be better at organization. We could also change out schools image to other parents, kids, and schools. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME",0,0.730118989944458
"Extra curricular activities can be fun, and exciting for some students to enjoy, and participate in. But others may find the activities time inducing, and pointless. Other students could also have things they do out of school, like for example, sports. Making it impossible to do these activities. But Some of the students who have an interest for the activities will use it as ways to meet new people, and create hobbies. Participating in extra curricular activities can be can be good for people who are interested, but the students should have a choice if they dont even want to be apart of something they aren't interested in. The reason is that some students may have out of school activities, preventing them the ability to do these extracurricular activities, or the student may have a medical issue, like for example, asthma. In which, they wont be able to do certain activities, or any at all for that matter. Transportation can also be and issue for some students, not all students have a ride home if the school bus isnt there. And sometimes their parent wont be able to get them after school, due to work, or traffic. Which will prevent students from being able to participate in these activities if they dont have a ride home. On the other hand, extracurricular activities can have positive outcomes. Some students will be able to find new ways of expressing themselves and become friends with people that share the same hobbies as themselves. But thats only if they're interested and WANT to join these sports, clubs, etc. The school should not make extracurricular activities a ""must"" and assume that the students will be able to do these activities, without knowing about the things preventing the students from being able to do these activities. And some may not even want to be apart of it, because not everyone is interested in sports, or yearbook club. My conclusion is that students should always have a choice, and not be forced into being apart of extracurricular activities they dont want to be apart of. also due to things they do outside of school, medical issues, and having no way to get home after, prevents them from being able to participate.",0,0.7904191613197327
I'm strongly against because most of the student wouldn't be able to play because most of them have and average of a grade level C and its not that good. In our school you can't play a sport if you have an F or two D' s. Also there's a very few amount of student who have an average of B and that's not going to help if you make a sport were there's have to more then 15 students to play if most of them don't even have an average grade level of a B. If you made the average grade level to be a C there will be a ve lots of student available to play sports. I think that you should make the students not get and F or D if they want to play a sport. Also the majority of the schools don't let students play any sport if they have a F or D because they need to focus on there school homework. If you had the students vote most of them will be against it because they want to play a sport no matter what. I think that the students who want to play a sport and they have a very low grade you should make them go to programs after school. In our school if you have a bad grade and you want to play a sport you could go to programs after school like afters. I think that your making a bad choice if you choose to make that policy because then you wouldn't have enough students to play sports but you could make programs to help them out after school which most of the students wouldn't want to go because they might think its a waste of time. Imagine you were one of those students you wouldn't be happy about it because you do want to play that sport really bad because its your passion.,0,0.7256380319595337
"Dear principal, Have you ever thought of a time when you were not sure if you should help the community or not. To me, that has happened multiple of times. I think that the students should be required to perform in the community because it would help them in many ways. Helping the community learn how to be unselfish, be better people in their lives ahead, and it would benefit everybody in that community. In the first place, by the students being required to perform in the community they will learn how to be unselfish and to help other people. While the students do this task of helping in the community, they will see how helping and thinking about others would do them much good. Not only that but that would also help them to learn to put other peoples needs in front of their wants. They can want a fancy sports car while another person may NEED food to put on the table and feed their children. Pursuing this further, it would help them be better people in their lives ahead. By helping people now and planting trees so on so forth, they will learn that by helping other people would make them feel good inside. That would make them feel that helping others is a fantastic thing that they should carrying on through out their whole life. Lastly, it would benefit every person and every thing in that community. Something as simple as helping a senior citizen cross the street would make a HUGE difference. Planting a tree would give more oxygen to the air and fertilize the soil with its nutrients. doing any little good deed would help the environment and the community around it. In retrospect, this is what a good deed would look like if the students were to perform in the environment. It would be a good idea because it would teach the students not to be selfish, be better people, and it would benefit the whole community at that. I personally think it's a great idea to have the students be required to perform in the community. How about you? what do you think we should do?",0,0.7717528343200684
"The difference between studying at home and school Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Let us going back in time to see how did get here. During revolutionary war in United State of American. Some british had education, but there was not school at the time. Being able to give education for students it was home. And this was for colonies teaching them in group how they can introduce by themeselves and understand command they are given. Late in 1800s to 1900s system changed by government of the time because it began to underatand how education was imporatant to the people. It began to build some classes, so people will not struggle for taking class at home or under the trees. The challenge was not is because the main points was money and people need to do this governement used one idea to increase tax for everything in able to finish the plan. That is how classes have been found. Time of technologies a rise was in middle of 1950s were people began to use new material like box computer and other stuff. Today we do have many choice as for school we may take classes onlline, pay tutor at home, or taking classes at school. What i have discoved is when you are taking classes at school your diverse yourself better that at home, or online. Yes i do think that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because the challenge of studying at school wil not be similarity to the challenge of taking classes at home. School does many things can reguard a students to stay focus. While, he or she is taking classes. Take a look some examples: First your will be able to increase knowledge of communication all the time to anyone. Second you will have a chance to create a beautiful profile even you never think that you will have it. What i meant is when you are student you are a mirrow to other especially in our community becase school contain many difference cultures. Third is you will have extra help than home or online. The specific idea of attending classes is to learn new things you never knew before. You know the way you may understood in front of the teacher it will not same the way you are watching video or reading online. Another thing you may see is some student the have many activities they attend like physical education, musical instruments, and some they are in clubs. Which meenas you have benefit everywhere. Moreover, taking clesses at school is still better options because the environment by itself is enjoyable. Making friends that you can have fun with, or they could help you when you are in diffuclt stuation. they are many things you will benefit from. As you taking classes at school. Some people may argue that is not fair whether you taking classes at school,home,or online you still have same education and academies in excellectual way. Because you do have a schedule. They do have schedule. Your taking different subjects. They do taking different subjects. You do have many different options and other they do. And they think that the way student whose taking classes at home or online may have same view to the student whose taking classes at school. One of the highest point of this people who supporting the students are taking classes at home is. The student will have enough time to do many work than students who are taking classes at school because. You may choose to work other things and return to do your activity for school. And you may choose different options that none has choosed, but that how they think i do not. Meanwhile, the idea of this part is very complicated because the way this people think about this is very consiousness. you may ask me how but the answer is. The way students who are taking classes at school it will never become similar to the students who arevtaking classes at home. You know that descreptions of many empires became emphisizable because the way peolpe attended to school the time brought many idea than the student who used to do their own without having many different thought. Based on me it seems to understand idea of how people argue that the milk may test like water really! Another thing is to review the important stuation of student who are taking classes at school. Given point to this topic is to analyzing the main result from students who are taking classes at home and the ones are taking classes at school. Because the students classes at school always seems right than other. The way student behave, the way student handle task, and how much effort that he is using. But at home student may cheat not body knows, whether he complited task or not. No one have to care. That the bid different you may see. Because is said the meaangless of student who work by himself he will never feel couragoues like other it is hard. Even to trust what he is doing sometimes nor always. ON my cocnlusion i will adrress the creason that igiven on seoncd paragraph and i will adreress the description of difference i have given on paragraph four. And i will conclude the paragraph three as the last. One i given the reason of how stdent who are taking classes at school thay do have many benefit. Two i have given the description on paragraph four of how student who are taking classes at home, and student who are taking classes at school is not same classes at home have few benefit. Because the situation it may not be serious and this paragraph it is kind reason that i have given, but not necessary. Last and not least i was focus on paragraph three where i did not have things to saybecause is not strong argument, and ihave given one reason on it and few examples.",0,0.8142734169960022
"I really agree with this statement. 
I am sure that one day there will have fewer cars than today or that these cars will be different than today.
Cars produce so much pollution and cause dammages to our environment.the problem is that everyone use his own car to go working, go to school,or other activities. it could be so much better if people use one car for four persons. At firts the pollution will be reduce and also that is cheaper to share the costs of transport between four persons.
An other way to reduce the number of cars is to not use it too often and use it only for long travel, if it is possible use a little moto or bycicle for short travel.
Take the bus or the train can be an other good alternative to the cars, but in this case the govrnment must give more money to these public transports for allow them to reduce the price of a ticket.
Futhermore, having more taxes on the oil, tax of circulation, and give a reduction to workers who use public transports can influence behaviours.
There will be fewer cars, but I think also that they will be differents than today. We must look for others oil,more respectfull of nature.As an exemple we can not the sun ( but the problem is that in every country the sun is not shining all the day and more, not every days), the wind but it is the same problem, it`s depend too much of the climatics conditions. Today there are some hybride cars, that`s show the a beginning of a changement  but  not the end.
If we want to save our world, everyone must do something, it is a socitie problem. More cars, will reduce the problem of pollution and heathl.",0,0.9053680300712585
"Throughout the whole elementary, middle and high school, I have learned both ideas and facts from the school. I have come to realize that whenever I understand the ideas and concepts, I can do so well in the test. However, it doesn't mean that I agree on the statement. Instead, in my opinion, facts certainly obtain more valuable life experiences for students from their ancestor. 
        In the chinese culture, we have a dialogue: ""reading million books can not be compared to walking million miles"". I think about this statement everytime when I am traveling in somewhere. Some might think that this dialogue doesn't apply to the statement. However, what I mean with the dialogue is that, the ideas from the book is dead, but experience is something that has once live on world. Although understanding the idea may help me to obtain a high math or science score, it is however, not much helpful instead of it. This is my conclusion based upon my three years in United States. 
          I am living in the school domitary. It is a house with eight girls living inside, supervised by a houseparent. The first day of my second year in America, I arrived the house, and it was the beginning of hell. My new houseparent, is, in most of the girls' opinion, the worst human being we have met on earth. It is not the matter of her weird English after more than twenty years in United States, it is not the matter that she cooks bad or enforces rule strictly. As an adult and an counsellor, who should be well-feeded by different ideas and knowledges, she however has favorism on certain girls. Out of no reason, she treated me meanly ever since the first day I got there. For instance, she went into my room without knocking on my door, yelled at me for not doing the chrous, which in fact, in not my work. Moreover, she absuptly refused my request for leaving my room so that I can get change. In addition, she isolated the house into two groups, and talks behind the back of the group she doesn't like. I have learnt since then, that ideas and concepts doesn't change a person personality, Just as my devil like houseparent, who has been a consellor in publich school, who knows thousand of theories. Whenever I  was trying to express my idea, she never understand, nor does she ever care about me. I learned fact that talking concepts to her do not help anything. According to my experience, the only way to live happily is to keep my mouth shut. Hopefully, this is going to end in two mouthe,.",0,0.9229928851127625
"The concept of aliens is a topic that some of us believe and some of us do not. Whether it has to do with how aliens may have affected how Earth was created or that there are other living organisms on planets other than Earth. Most scientists have used reasonable research to discover that aliens are not real, but yet there are still some scientists that believe they are in fact real. Based on the photos taken of the Face, aliens did not create this structure, it is simply just a natural landform. In 1976, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft visited Mars and discovered the Face while snatching photos for landing areas for the Viking 2 ship. It looked as though it was the shape of a head, which is why it is known as the Face. This formation was gigantic, measuring almost two miles across. Something so giant couldn't have been formed from aliens, especially if it resembles a head, symbolizing that it may be an imprint of an actual alien. As they studied the photos of the Face, they began to realize how similar its features were to those of a human's face, or this case, what could be an alien. These facial features were then recognized to be just shadows, which adds to the fact that the imprint of a human, or alien face, could not have been formed. A formation this large cannot resemble that of a human, nethertheless an alien. For twenty-five years, ""The Face of Mars"" was a famous attraction, attracting many people to be interested and cause an even broader range of thoughts about how this landform was created. As more people become engaged in this unusual formation, NASA continued to snap photos of the Face to uncover more information about what it really was and how it was really created. Later on, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took one more picture that had ten times the resolution that the orginal Viking images had. When this picture was viewed by many on a web site, it then revealed that it was, indeed, a natural landform and there was no evidence of aliens, as many people thought. Information from the several images that were taken establish that this structure is a natural landform, and not a creation from aliens. Even though images proved that the Face was a natural landform and not something created by aliens, there still remained people who didn't believe this concept. At the time the most recent photo was taken, it was winter on the planet, and the Face on Mars was located in an area that consisted of a cloudy region. Those who still believed that aliens created the Face also believed that this area of clouds could have affected the picture that was taken during that time. The scientists claimed that it isn't an easy task to find the Face and capture a decent picture of it when possible, but still yearned to capture another shot to prove that aliens had not created it. So, on a summer day that consisted of no clouds, the team captured another photo with the maximum resolution. Because of the outstanding resoluation of the photo, it then again proved that it was simply anatural landform and that aliens did not play a part in it's creation. Throughout the journey of discovering whether this creation was formed by aliens or that it was a natural landform the scientists and photos taken proved that there were no aliens. Although somemay still believe that there were aliens, these photos demonstrate real evidence that there was not. Like the scientists said, it was very similar to a landform on Earth, that is created naturally. Because of this discovery of the Face, scientists have been given the chance to explore the realmsof creations on other planets and prove that they cannot be formed by aliens, but simply by the natural occurences that take place on that planet.",0,0.7733644843101501
"Its that time of year where students have to complete a summer project. These projects are a way of making sure that the students are learning and being productive throughout their summer vacation. Students best know their own interests, so, summer projects should be student-designed because it ensures that students will be engaged, leads to completion of the project, and promotes the continuation of their interests. Although, some people may think that student-designed summer projects are not the best way to have students continue their education. For the reasons of it leads to researching non-important topics or results in students not taking the project seriously. This point of view makes sense because if the projects are teacher-designed it would ensure that all students are learning about something important and valuable to their education. However, this point of view is wrong because the definition of an important topic is different to everyone. Students will do the summer project on something of importance or value to them because they have the option to make it something or their own and make it unique. Students will always become engaged in a topic if the have the freedom to choose it. While students are getting ready to choose what they want to do during the summer they will become interested about the topic they choose. This will make sure that students are kept interested throughout the summer to produce something that they are proud of. For example, a students favorite animal is a panda and he or she wants to research, visit museums, visit libraries, and visit the zoo to learn more about them and be able to come up with a good project. This student is eager to learn about something he or she loves and is passionate about. This project will keep this student fully engaged through the summer learning about the panda. All students have something that they are interested in and if they choose a topic and create a project it may even open and door to a passion they were not aware of. In addition, the completion of the student-designed summer project is critical to their learning because without the completion of it students will not get the full experience of learning what they picked on their project. If students are allowed to design their own projects the teachers will not have to worry about a students not completing the project because they became uninterested or bored. Students will be eager to complete their projects and that is all a teacher could want is to have a student eager about a project and then complete it because they wanted to not because they were forced to. For example a student is given the topic of rocks and the student has never had an interest in this. The student will struggle because they have no interest in researching rocks. This student will most likely not complete the project or will do it in the last week of summer. This prevents students of having a valuable learning experience with something that they like. As well as students having a variety of interests, if the summer projects are student-designed they could explore an area of interest that they are already familiar with and dive in deep to what they like. This could help a student find out more information on a topic they think they may like or already know that they have a passion for. For example, if a student is interested in medicine and they want to become a doctor why would they need to research rocks? This student will have the time to research what she wants to do with her future while also completing her schools requirement. It is a great thing for a young student to already be setting their mind into what they will like to do in their future and researching it. Summer learning projects should be student-designed because it help ensure that students will be engaged, leads to project completion, and allows for the continuation of personal interests. Students need to have a time to be able to research and make a project on a topic that they enjoy learning about and what better time than the summer to do that. Young students are the future, so, the schools should permit student-designed summer projects to have the students better understand the topic of their choice. The next time students have to do summer project they should be allowed to design it and stride for their best educational experience.",0,0.8190920948982239
"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author did suggest that studying Venus is a wotrthy of pursuit despite the dangers it presents. He stated example of the circumstances and problems that can possibly happen when trying to explore other planets such as Venus and he did not just state the problem but also put in the benefits on when we keep trying and not give up, we could actually get evidence and answers on what we are looking for. The author supports the idea on the fact that ""exploring Venus might be dangerous but worth it,"" very well when looking back at the passage. One evidence in the article that supports his claim is, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" It says in the article that Venus was like Earth once and it had the source of water in it and had in fact supported various forms of life, so I think that this is very importat because we don't know what might happen to our planet Earth, it is not in our ability to control changes on Earth and that is why it is good to know that even though it might change, we have a second option to know that we can always go to a different planet to survive. Another evidence that the author had said in the passage was,""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" Once again, it might take us forver to get answers for our questions and get what we are looking for but throughout the process everyone learns and somehow it will lead us into many more things more than exploring Venus, it might help us with other things that we do not have evidence for yet. In conclusion, the author did a great job on expressing his thoughts on his idea. He was very specific with it and had evidence that I also explained earlier to show people that it is going to be dangerous, some people might just give up because they see no point in doing it, they have been searching for too long and have not found anything but I know that it will be worth it, it might not be today but sooner or later it will be.",0,0.8206430077552795
"The limiting of cars in the world and commuinities sounds terrible but in a way its not all that bad for one reason it helps reduce smog in the area, people get more physical activity by walking and by cleaning up the city new business will come to the twon/city you live in people drive there cars everywhere they go, to the store, the mall, out to eat even if its in walkinng distance people relay on there car to get them where they need to go and this is a big problum because its creating unheathy smog in the environment that people and animals live in and by relaying on cars to get them where they need to go the people are only making the situation even worse then its becoming. Smog is like a poison fog created by cars and things of that nature and is put into the atmosphere for people to breath into there lungs and is but into there body just beacuse they ""need"" to drive where they ""have""to go in such a hurry. when you remove cars for an extended period of time or just the day people are forced into physical activity to relay on when they have to go places like the store, the mall, out to eat ect. its good for people just to get out and exercise instead of someone saying im going to the drug store that is a 5 min walk down the road. now its alot more reasonable if the place your going in like 5 miles from where you live then yes drive but if is 5 min walk just walk its not going to kill you. even if its just biking up the road to get the mail it still beats driving for no reason on somthing you could walk/bike to get. If you remove cars once a week, evan once a year you could clean up the town/city you live in to bring new business to the town you live in and new busnisses means new jobs so that an econome increases in the town because it been cleaned up and new busniess has be created in your town. in these three paraghaphs ive given three great reasons why imiting cars is a great advantage and help the small towns to big cities around the world.",0,0.6505503058433533
"Are you the kind of person that is really interested in political stuff? Politics can be a subject that will start fights, but not everyone is so interested. You must know what the electoral college is. It is a system where when you vote for your president you are actually voting for a group of electors that will then vote for the president(Source 1). This means that even if there is a majority in the popularity vote from the people. The electoral college can over rule that and vote for the other. Some say the electoral college is good because it prevents ties or because it will make sure there is a winner. But if they can over rule your vote are you really voting for your president? I say the electoral college is a bad system and it needs to be extinguished. There is no doubt that you should get to decide who your leader will be. And if the electoral college can over rule your vote do you really feel like it's your decision? In the 2000 presidential race, Al Gore lost because he recieved the most popularity votes from the people but the electoral college voted for Bush instead(Source 2). This means that the people thought Al Gore should be the president but instead they didn't get what they wanted because the electoral college thought otherwise. Do you think this is in anyway fair? The majority of the country ended up unhappy with the election because of ther electoral college. I say that alone is enough reason to abolish the electoral college. If it happens once it can happen again. Do you want to feel cheated and betrayed again? Let's get rid of the electoral college! Some others may say that they support the electoral college because it can't have a tie. ""Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality ina state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state.""(Source 3). It is still possible to have a tie though because there are 538 total votes and since that is an even number then it can happen. And if there is just a stlight difference and instead the electoral college creates a landslide then that isn't representing the actuall number of the votes by the people. Once again you are being cheated out of your sya it the election. The hardest thing to understand is why people would still support something that doesn't support them. The electoral college basically throws away your votes and replaces them with theirs. And once again, it is possible for ties in the electoral college due to the even number of votes. ""Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much to say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters.""(Source 2). This alone shows that your votes are being represented equally. It is saying that 500,000 votes are equal to 35 million votes. Isn't it obvious that those two numbers are very different and they could have a very large effect on the popularity of each canidate that they are voting for? but instead they have they same effect and the 34.5 million voters that don't get their fair say could very possibly be unhappy with the turnout of the president. The people are supposed to be the ones that vote for their leader, not a group of 538 ""qualified"" polititians that can over rule the entire country's vote. It's ridiculous how the system works and you are crazy if you support it. I know i want my fair share of input and the electoral college won't allow that. There are supporters who say that they support the electoral college because it avoids run-off elections. Because even if there is a tie in the majority votes from the people it is unlikey for there to be a tie in the votes from the electoral college. ""For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the electoral College...""(Source 3). In my opinion if there is a tie in the popularity votes then they should revote, it may take longer but it will still be a decision by the people. Just because it makes the procces faster doesnt mean it makes the procces better. They can create a better system in the event of a tie instead of electors over ruling the people and picking whoever they think is best. That isnt government for the people, by the people. In conclusion, the electoral college needs to be extinguished for many reasons. those reasons are because it doesn't let the people vote for who they want and it over rules a notions votes. And because it doesnt show the number of votes as equall. Some may say that it is good because it prevents a tie but if there is a tie then I'm sure htere are better ways to revote. we need government for the people, by the people and that isn't what the electoral college is.",0,0.787564754486084

"Missing school is every student's worst nightmare. It is extremely difficult to makeup work on time and not fall behind. Students don't have a way to effectively get and complete their work on time from home. Many students will try to email their teachers for the missing work and get no response, only to be ridiculed the next day about not completing their work on time. Students would benefit exponentially from being able to attend classes from home because they would be able to make up the work they missed, If a student was hurt or ill they wouldn't have to worry about coming to school when they aren't well, and in case of an emergency situation where schools had to be shut down, students could still receive an education. Many students, especially in high school, take a very heavy course load with lots of homework. This amount of work makes it extremely difficult when a student misses school. In many cases the student will have to wait until they are back in school to see what they missed, but by that time the class has moved on to something new. Students that miss school will have to do the work they missed on top of their regular classwork; This is very stressful for students. If a student could do their class work online they would eliminate all the stress of missing school. They could complete the work that they missed in class at home, while keeping their grades up and their mental health well. They could then come back to school and continue with their work like they were never even gone. They would continue on their curriculum as planned with no extra work from the students or teachers. This would benefit the student's incredibly. Getting sick or injured is one of the worst things that can happen to a student. In many cases, students will have to miss days of classwork and wait until they come back to school to retrieve it. They can get behind in their classwork and their grades can fall. This anxiety causes students to come back to school sick or injured in order to avoid falling behind in their classes. If a class was available to be taken online, the students would be able to take their time to properly recover before coming back to school. This way, the overall health of the student body would be better because students wouldn't be coming to school sick. Also, students would not have to struggle getting from class to class with an injury. If there were an emergency where schools had to be shut down, students would still be able to learn. Emergency shutdowns are never something that people want, but schools must be prepared. In some cases of bad weather conditions or quarantines, schools have to be shut down for long periods of time. This causes a lot of stress for students and faculty because they both will have to struggle to make up for the time they lost. If there was a way to take classes online, students would not have to struggle with trying to understand expedited lessons with no support from their teachers because they don't have enough time. In some extreme cases, schools could be shut down for weeks due to a quarantine or bad weather like earthquakes or tornadoes. In these cases schools have to run into summer break to make up for lost time. If there were a way to take classes online, the school wouldn't have to do that. Students and staff would be able to complete classes on time and well. A class that could be taken online for a period of time while a student is absent would benefit them exponentially. Students would not have to worry about falling behind in their classes and getting a bad grade because of it. They wouldn't have to come in sick or injured to prevent getting a grade that they don't like. The spread of illness from student to student would significantly lower due to this change. In case of emergency, students could be taught the curriculum at home and on time without having to deal with any rushed makeup lessons. Finally, the mental health of the student body would be significantly better because of the effort that the school has taken to better their education system.",0,0.8014084696769714
"first of all I'm going to argue about changing election by popular vote for the president of the United States. the Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting the a president that out to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense. Second off, but each party, selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed)...[;however,] it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet it happens rarely. Also there are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree; all are practical reasons, not liberal or coservative reasons. Thirdly, a dispute over the outcomes of an Electoral College vote is possible it happened in 2000 but it's less likely than a dipute over the popular vote. The reason is the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. in [ 2012's] election, for example obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral votes compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney... because almost all staes award electoral votes on a winner-take-all-basis, even a slight plurality in a state creates a landslide of electoral-vote victory in theat state. Finally, the Electoral College avoids the problem of election in which no candidates recives a majority of votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoal votes, respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presendential elections process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner.",0,0.8192020058631897
"In this article the author tells us about Venus. He tells us that it is called the ¨Evening Star¨, that it is known as Earths ¨twin¨, and then he explains the attempts made to study and learn more about the planet. He also explains how those attempts were unsucsessful and that the planet is dangerous. But, despite the dangers he has presented to us, he explains that it is worth the danger. I dont personaly believe he did the best job explaining why he believed so and he definitly did not convince me to think the same. The author never truely explained his claim that he thought exploring Venus was worth the risks and complications. For most of the artical he rambles on telling us about and explaining what was already found out about the planet. He never gave reasoning for believing we sould follow threw with trying to learn more about the planet. He only breifly told us his claim in the last paragraph, paragraph 8. It reads, ¨Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.¨ He tells us that all we will get from risking our lifes is insite on a dangerous planet that we may not even have use for, and he states that we will be faced with more and or equally intimidating endeavors. It may just be my opinion but that does not seem like very convincing or valid reasons for putting lifes in danger. I truely believe that the author of the artical, ¨The challenge of Exploring Venus¨ did not support his claim and what he believed very well let alone at all. All he gives us is two reasons that are not very valid and did not back them up or tell us why those reasons make a good point and sould make us think the same way. He did not tell us why we needed the information so badly that we should risk our lifes or even make the effort. I do not belive the author supported the idea or really stated his claim or what he belived. He needs more reasoning and explaining of what we would gain from this and how it would benifit us. He also would need more supporting details of what we need the information for and why.",0,0.8432790637016296
"A claim that evaluates the author idea is... No matter how hard they try and study about the Venus and learn how to land there safetly, its still going to be a dangrous. like every time u send some one there to study, the spacecraft cant land for a hours and they get in danger. The author kinda want people to just give it up. no matter what you do, Venus will be Venus. In the article it says ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"". Venus is a earth twin but u should never dream to go there. There is no spacecraft that survive landing in Venus. In the article it says ""No spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours"". The spacecraft cant survive it because the Venus is so hot. NASA is working on other approaches to studing Venus. They be sending people to Venus just to study Venus. They are trying harder and harder. They are now using some old technology called mechanical computers to study Venus. The mechanical computers were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War ll. NASA wont give up on studying Venus. People didnt know what Venus is before. Back then, Venus was coverd by tree and and mountains just like the earth. Now you can see it at the night time. Venus is called the "" Evening Star,"". It is one of the brightest light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot. The Venus is the dangrous planet that u should never go. No spacecraft servived the landing for more than a few hours. NASA is working very hard to study about the Venus and maybe wanna map everything on it.

"The aim of the modern education is not making the students learn or memorize the facts. Instead, it is introducing them ideas and concepts. Teaching ideas and concepts will make the students understand the underlying reasons behind the facts. They will gain a broad vision which is based on ideas and concepts. Through this vision they can understand and eveluate facts in a more comprehensive manner. It is more important for the students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn the facts because it is more meaningful and more practical. 
	First of all, without ideas and concepts facts are not meaningful. The ideas and and concepts make the facts meaningful. For example without knowing the ideas and concepts of early twentieth century it is not possible to understand First World War. The dominant political idea was nationalism which resulted in the deep hostilities amng the nations. There are concepts such as imperialism, struggle for market expansion etc. Without understanding these ideas and learning these concepts one can only memorize the chronolgy of the war but can not understand it properly. 
	Secondly, it is much more practical to make students learn concepts and ideas rather than facts. It is impossible to make a student to learn all the facts. But if he or she is given a theoratical perspective based on ideas and concepts, he would be able to evoluate facts that he faces. Ideas and concepts would turn out to be useful tools in h's hands to interprit the facts. The facts are written in the books. If one needs to use them he can open a book and read it. It is very easy. For this reason it is not practical to learn them by heart. 	
	In conclusion, It is more important for the students to learn ideas and concepts than to learn facts. It is better first to forge a theoratical framework with ideas and concepts then evoluate events in this framework. It is both more meaningful and more practical.",0,0.8475765585899353
"i agree that all students should at least participate in one extracurricular activity Because you can try something new and you can pick what you want to do and meet new people and make more friends. You can learn new skills and learn how to cooperate with people. The best choice are sports because they let you push yourself also there fun. If you get super good at the sports you can do it as a job and get a lot of money. The other best one is helping the school out like work on the yearbook or help clean up. Or you can do art,soccer,football,golf and many more.

"In my opinion in some cases it's better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects, instead, in another cases, it's better to specialize in only one or two specific subjects.
I think that at the primary, secondary and high school it's better to have a generical knowledge, like what is actually in use in the majour states of the world (I belive and I hope it is truth), than to specialize in only one specific subject. Here we have a thirteen generical years  knowledge and I think it is not bad!
I think that when we arrive at university it is right to specialize in only one or two specific subjects because actually we live in a world where everyone think to be able to do everythihg but this is not the truth!

"A new technology called the Facial Action Coding System, is a system used to read facial expressions and identify human emotions. By recognising muscles in your face, it can determine if your happy, sad, disgusted, angry, or fearful. This new software has promising applications in a variety of fields and industries. With the Facial Action Coding System, you could simply look at a friend or anyone else and determine their emotional state of mind. This new software has the ability to change lives and help make decisons in a better school and work enviornment. This product has already been put to use and is proven to work. The question is, how could this benfefit the students if used in the classroom. The answer is yes, this could have a majior impact on students if done correctly. The emotions of students in the classroom is based on their surroundings and work enviornment. Using this technology, staff members could use the data collected aswell as, student information and preferances to make changes, benefiting the school. The results would not only help students but, staff members aswell. They would have a better understanding of how the school flows and even the emotions of students based on teachers. This would do nothing but bring a positive impact to students and should be strongly concidered. Based on info from the article, the Facial Action Coding System, has huge possibilties to make changes not only in the classroom but, could be used to make better decions throughout the whole world. This Software is a great use of technology and should be concidered and eventially used by everyone.

Or we could send out ten people to go to every school in the county and read books to people in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd grade. Some of us can work in a soup kitchen whenever they are free. Maybe sometime we can have an assembly at our school and we can hire a public speaker to tell us about how helping the community can help us and everyone else! This could be a great idea.

"Dear state senator, i argue you that we keep the electoral collage because of its many pros. Taking away the electoral college would be like taking away an important part of our U.S history, the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. With the electoral college there would be more discussion on the topic of making smart descions to electing a president. Keeping the electoal college will keep a professional way of electing a president. The electoral college selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the partys nominee (and the trust given is rarely betrayed). With that said, it will be a fair and most likely a cheat free zone. The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate receives a majority of the votes cast. When a run off happens this creates pressure of the voters, until the help of the electoral college comes in, which in this case helps break everything up and claim a true winner. For example, in 1968 nixon and clinton in 1992 both had only 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the electoral college, 301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively.

"Phones & Cars: The Dream (Nightmare) Team Considering that these essays are graded by staff workers who aren't paid enough, I'd think it's fair to say that the reader of this is a driver. Whether you go buy car, bike, bus, etc. it's still driving, and driving should never be combined with texting or phone calling. Using the phone while driving is never safe, neither to yourself nor others. One key point is that you become distracted. Becoming distracted can cause danger to yourself or others, as you are piloting a giant steel box. Going offroad could hurt yourself. You could also accidentally smash into other cars. You could also use your phone's bluetooth to stream music to your car's radio. However, since you're only listening to music that you already like, there's a good chance that you might get too into the music and get distracted. This could also cause you to run off the road and potentially hurt yourself and others. In conclusion, phones can be a dangerous and evil device that can cause harm to you or other drivers while you are on the road. Because of this, you should always put away your phone once you begin driving. Throw it into the back seat or put it in the glove box.",0,0.7357293963432312
"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", the technology that the author describes called Facial Action Coding System, that lets you make up and show human emotions in pictures. I am for this new use of technology, Only because when taking a picture in the old times alot of people really didn't smile they just looked at the artist, while the artist painted them. I feel as though this is a good thing, not because it creates emotion in the picture, it gives the person looking more understanding of how maybe the person in the picture is feeling. I find it very cool that they can use a 3D scale model of the face and maintiain the muscles in the face that move just like our muscles in or face move today. ""The facial expression for each emotion are universal, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression."" Also I find it cool how the famous painter ""Da VInci could study human anatomy enoough to help him pain the facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions"" When I look at the new Mona Lisa painting I do smile and think that maybe she was happy to have taken this picture, I mean we'll never know what she really felt in the painting.

"In my opoion I think it would be kind of cool if a computer were to read students facial expressions. If a computer were to actually do this, it would be to detect how a person is feeling and that would make everyone else curious of how the computer can real people's emotion and make them want to see hoow it works. This would be very valuable to many students because it can detect how their feeling and if they're feeling down they can maybe talk to a teacher about it, or may just want to be left alone. This computer may also put people on the spot as to how their feeling, and may not to express themselves. This piece of technology might make people feel desprite of need to talk to someone anbout why they are feeling the way they are feeling. There are limits to how far this technology can go to reading someone's facial expressions and emotion because there are some people that don't want a computer to read how there feeling out loud to anyone but there self. But I also think that this kind of technology could not be useful because it would make people feel like they are being put on the spot for feeling a certain kind of way instead od feeling a way everyone wants them to feel. It would put almost everyone at risk because they might just want to be left alone and not want a computer to know how they are feeling. This kind of technology would be useful in some ways, but that also depends on how you present this kind of technology to people and how you deminstrate this to poeple who don't have any idea on what this is used for or how it would be helpful to everyone else if a computer were read out loud how you are feeling.

"There are much more things that students must know than the students used to must know. Especially after industrial revolution, in the area of engineering science there have been lots of development. Some are not used anymore, some are still being used. If it is used, students have to have knowlegde about that. However there are so many thing which students have to know that it cannot be given into a single person. So learning ideas and concepts is more important than to learn ideas for two reasons.
   First, it is the idea that create facts. All the facts come from a inventor or from a group of inventor. They have got first the idea, then try it and see whether it works or not. If students know the concepts, they can know where inventor made things wrong. Actually, this is the way of development. For example, for all people know that if apple falls from a tree, it hits the earth, but newton asked why. From this point of view, he got another idea from a fact and created another fact. As in this example it is beneficial students to learn ideas in order to increase their creativity.
   Secondly, as mentioned above, there are lots of things to learn. In a limited time period students learn either some facts and its applications very well or ideas and concepts of many thing. Second one sounds better. The reason why second one sounds better is because of globolization. If a person has some ideas about a issue, he or she can many available information about that issue on the library or on the internet.

"The build up of greenhouse gases and carbon emissions over the past hundred years since the car was first invented have started a decline in the usage of a private car. People are moving back into cities and are suing their cars signifigantly less with places such as Bogota Columbia having a day dedicated to no driving. Bikes and other forms of public transportation have become much more appealing than using a car and this trend looks like it will continue In source one, in Vauban, Germany they are no longer using cars and instead are using alternative forms of transportation in this suburb. Heidrun walter a resident of this city talked about how he was ""always tense"" when owning a car which is true. It can be very stressful having to drive around and in the case of crowded areas have to sit in traffic for two hours a day. Another reason to get rid of your cars is the effects on the environment with 50% of carbon emissions in some parts of the US being blamed on cars. New laws in the US are also promoting the use of public transportation in the United States own suburbs giving suburban residents more of a reason to rid themselves of a car. In cities public transportation has been already implemented and can be much more efficent than driving around yourself. The pollution in many cities such as Bejing is very intense and makes living conditions awful. Paris, one of the more polluted cites in Europe experienced a partial driving ban after a build up of smog in the city. This shows that if you rid yourself of a car you wont have to worry as much about contributing to this costly pollution to our environment. During the driving ban congestion was down 60% shwoing how this contribute to less traffic as well. In source 3 it discusses the no car day in Bogota Columbia showing how worldside people are starting to avoid overusing their cars and want to promote a healthy planet for us all. Parks and biking paths have emerged in this emerging latin american city and its shifting towards the right direction, of no cars. The car culture in America has begun to die down a bit in the United States with car usage peaking 2005(Source 4). Car ownership rates are going down and more people are begining to just not get their lisences at all, and this trend will continue showing that you too should hop on this trend of lower to no car usage at all.

On the contrary we will see that most of them seem to get involved in their society.

"In the passage "" The Challange of Exploring Venus,"" the author gives his opinion on the topic saying that it would be a worthy pursuit to study and explore Venus despoite the dangers it presents. Venus is the second planet to the sun and it is often reffered to as Earth's ""Twin"". This would be because of their like size shape, size, and density. Still Venus is not safe for many reasons, altough many scientist believe that it would be great to keep on trying to explore Venus. I will evaluate some of the points that are made that show why exploring Venus is something that we should pursuit and how some of dangers may not allow it. We will first start of with some of the dangers that Venus holds for any explorer. Venus is very close to Earth and very similar so many would think it would be little more simple to explore, but you would be wrong if you think like this. Venus' temperatures can average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, 10 times more than some temperatures here on Earth. Venus also has clouds of high corrosive sulfuric acid. Now I'm not a scientist but I'm for sure that mean that it can burn our faces off very excessevily fast. In Venus there is also geographic and weather problems like here on Earth, except these arent anything like small rain showers or high winds. These are erupting volcanoes at every corner, powerful earthquakes,and lighting strikes very often. In paragraph 3 the author puts all thuis into perspective by saying "" sunch an enviornment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquify many metals."" Now with all these dangers being said there are still many people who want to explore Venus. One of them being the author of this passage. The author gives very good points on why Venus would still be a great pursuit. One of the points that author brings up is that Venus could have once been something similar to Earth, maybe even habitable for us humans. To go along with this in paragraph 4 the athor states ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely in oceans and could aave supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" This shows that Venus could have been as good as Earth many many years ago and that maybe their still is a chance that it is. This is a great point that really supports exploring Venus because for many years now NASA has been looking for a planet similar to Earth. Another great point the author bring up to supports his ideology of pursuing to explore Venus altough many dangers is that we have found many new ways to explore it. The authors states some ways to explore Venus without sending a human to Venus with the technology we have now and still be safe. In paragraph 5, the author says "" Imagine a blimp-like vechicle hovering thrity or so miles abovethe roiling Venusian landscape.' This shows that we have an idea to send a vechicle to Venus but not touch the ground to get information about Venus without the vechicle being destroyed. This helps the authors point a lot because now it shows we do have the innovations to explore Venus a bit better. There would be a little problem with this and that would be that we wouldn't have much samples of rocks, gas, or anything else. In conclusion I do believe that the author makes very good statements about why it would be good to keep pursuing the exploration of Venus. Venus does withold many dangers but everyday we are coming up with new techonology to make our lives easier maybe we could do the same for Venus. Also, Venus is could hold some very important information to us about how other plantes could be habitable by us and how this could be possible. The author got my attention from the start and never lost it, he used good facts and stats to backup his points, and thought us ways that Venus could be important to more than just astronamers and scientist.",0,0.8085227012634277
"In todays world of technology, not everything made can be trusted. There have been many flaws in the sources of technology that we use today. One reason why this stands true is the ""Driverless Car"" was first discovered in movies and television. Taking something from an animated commercial, tv show, or movie and making it into something that we can use in real life could in some situations, be very complicated to do so. How would the car know when and where to come get you? Will they always be reliable? Often, some of todays people can't even trust that their cell phone is going to keep all of their information private. Making it hard to trust developing technology. In addition, some of the ways that creators have come up with to make this happen is way out of our budget. As said in the section, instead of building ""smarter cars"" we could invest in building ""smarter roads"". This means that instead of putting all of the technology just in the car, it would also be included in the road system. This would cost millions, billions, maybe even trillions which is way out of our price range. The nation has too many things to take care of just to put all of our money towards something that we don't absolutely need. Lastly, how would we know that the sensors built into the vehicle are going to work all the time? How would we trust them? Failed sensors could result in many incidents such as car accidents, fires, or car pile-ups. Even if we do develop the vehicle, we can't always trust it because accidents do happen. Using this car in todays society could risk many lives, even if we're not in the vehicle. Yes, it would be a success for our world of technology to make this happen. But is it really a success for everyone? There's no problem with today system of people driving on their own so why change it. Ask yourself, do we really need this ""Driverless Car"" added to todays technology? Will it really benefit us that much? Can we trust every piece of technology handed to us?",0,0.8223844170570374
"Dear Principal, I think they shouldn't be required to do community service because, it might take up their time to hang out with friends, to do their homework, or to do extra circular activities in school. If they are forced to do community service they might be mean to the people they are helping or they could do a lousy job. If they were walking around town picking up litter they could not pick some up or they could be eating or drinking something and throw it on the ground and be making it worse than making it better. They could be toutering elementary children and be mean to them or they could be giving them the wrong answers because they don't know what it is that they are doing. If they are doing community service that they are forced to do they might not have enough time to finish their homework and fail the paper. If that happened they wouldn't be able to participate in any extra circular activities.

"I fervently agree with this futuristic statement that in twenty years, fewer cars will be in use than there are today.

Firstly, I believe that in the absence of effective and economic solutions to the problem of fuel today, with pollution and traffic on the rise, there is a pressing need to revitalise our public tranport system and  take appropraite measures to discourage private transport. Cars, that are the symbol of private conveyance not only heavily contribute heavily to the increasing pollution in every major city of the world,  but is also unnecessarily cluttering up the scarce space that we have left on the earth and its roads. This also is leading to a disastrous number of road accidents that are the cause of more deaths today than any epidemic or war. Twenty years from now, I do not see the severity of these problems alleviated unless we take some effective steps as reducing private transport , which I think is inevitable. In countries of Europe, the private transport even today is minimally used. 

Secondly, with globalization all around us, with boundaries of distances, cultures and languages rapidly dissolving, I see the car getting obsolete simply because our needs would be larger. With technology, I believe that local distances would become inconsequential and cars would give way to more advanced form of travel. Already, the first space tourist has made a successful trip and is back! 

With an Orwellian outlook of the world, I  have a dystopic vision of the world;  a world where for stability and efficiency, the state would assume power, where perhaps personal expression is rendered unimporant and the society or the community is primary. In such a society, the car which is basically a symbol of prestige and status has absolutely no space. 

Today, where we stand, with the all pervasive Internet growing beyond limits, in twenty years the world would be more of a virtual community. You and I would have a more predominant virtual existence than a real one. Our basic needs to survive everyday, chores that require us to move around on a daily basis would be conveniently done away with with the virtual world. Believe me, we'd be thriving on our virtual entity a lot more, depending on it for our daily needs without moving an inch! What does a car have to do in such a scenario?   

With the above points, I have made a cogent and strong statement asserting that cars have no place in our world twenty years from now.",0,0.8467072248458862
"Human emotion can be expressed by many things such as body language, tone, and language. Emotion allows us to understand others and empathize easier. A software known as Facial Action Coding System has been developed to improve accuracy of calculating the emotions of others. Using this technology to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is invaluable because humans already can ""calculate"" emotions, the classroom is not taught by a computer, and human emotions are very complex. The first reason that the FACS is invaluable to the classroom is because there is no need to use technology to ""calculate"" emotions of a student. A classroom consists of a teacher and several students which are humans. The author stated within the article, ""humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day,"" He further on states that we can probably tell how a friend feels just by the look on their face. Since humans can already perceive and understand emotions of others, there is no need for a mode of technology to figure out when someone is bored or confused about certain subjects in a classroom. When a student is bored or confused about a certain subject, he or she could simply ask for help from a teacher or a peer. Using the FACS technology would be redundant in reading emotional expressions of students; Therefore, it is invaluable technology. Computers are not what teach students in a classroom. The author tells the reader to imagine a classroom computer that could recognize your emotions, so it could ""modify the lesson like an effective human instructor."" There is always a human instrcutor( the teacher) in a classroom, so there should not be a need for a modification of a lesson by a computer when the teacher can modify the lesson. Students do not need to be dependent on a computer to learn what they need to learn in a classroom, and a computer that can calculate emotion is obsolete by its uselessness in the manner of learning. The final reason why emotion calculating technology is invaluable in a classroom is that emotion is too complex for just a classroom computer to calculate. First of all, emotion differs from person to person. In the aritcle Dr. Huang, a professor of the University of Amsterdam, said, ""The facial expression for each emotion are universal,"" but he also stated, ""individuals often show varying degrees of expression."" If emotional expressions are all unique, it would be very difficult for computers to calculate the exact feeling a students is feeling just by their facial expression. Also, in the seventh paragraph, the author stated, ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" This means that the classroom computer would not be able to calculate like how it was used in the article. In conclusion, the FACS is too redundant and under developed to be of any use for a classroom enviorment. It is invaluable and there are mulitple substitutes that can read emotional expressions of students in a school. In the future, with further innovations, there will be a time where classrooms use this type of technology to enhance education; but as of right now, the system is not useful for helping classrooms teach students.",0,0.8202319741249084
"People think that it is smart that you know everything. However, human' s ability is limited. Sometimes you need to be concerned about what you are really capable of. Some people do well on one specific subject some people on another, so i think that it is very good to have broad knowledge but not all the time. When you really think about it, if we specialize in one specific subject we would have more time to do it, and also we're more expert in it. 
  When we focus on one thing, we could spend more time on it than when with the other thing so interrupting. It's like that. People do not have two seperate spirit. Once we were interrupted, we might lose the important parts that we had been focused on. It would be too hard for normal people.
  Secondly when we specialize in a specific subject, we have more attention on it. We wouldn't be confused with two things. That way we remember more informations from that things we studied. 
  Lastly there is always something that we're good with and not food with. For example maybe i'm really good at playing tenis but once it goes on the table like ping-pong i totally messed up, because it is natrual. I were born this way. People can't forced me to do it, because that doesn't do any good either.
  Being an expert on one specific thing makes life less confusing. However, I'm not saying those smart guys who knows everything isn't smart enough to make lifeeasier. it's just i like it",0,0.9540441036224365
"Should summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? It's best that students should design the summer projects; they would have more opportunity to the projects than teachers would. Students have mindsets that would surprise some teachers at a stage of age. On the other hand people think that teachers should design the summer projects. The teachers would get many things out of the way for many students, and be prepared to present the project. I believe that students should design summer projects because the students would get a easy one-hundred, the kids would have more creative ideas, and there would be less stress on the teachers. Students recieving an easy one-hundred would be great for them. Since the students are kids, they can make the project become very fun in a physical and mentally way. The people would have fun trying to accomplish the projects in enjoyful ways and matter. They can make the themes better and easier to read or comprehensive for others. Plus it wouldn't be so stressful for the people to figure out. On the other hand, people think that teachers would make things happen faster than what the teachers are doing. The teachers work on the project would be way more planned out for the summer. Designs would be figured out for the teacher, and they would have things printed out. The project would be ready to be shown to people that are ready to complete it over the summer. Students would be better designers for the summer project. During this fun summer project, students would have more creative ideas than teachers would. The student-designed project can be created from a very strong imagination by the students. They believe that they can gather more people around the project. Some unique ideas can come up for the summer project and make it less boring to read, or to do have a whole. On the other hand, people believe that students would be in the way of trying to create a summer project. Teachers know how to take their time when it is necessary, and when to take their time on the summer project. They believe that the students would just pick anything to pick as a summer project without thinking about it. The teachers would be ready in time to have a summer project in mind. That's why summer projects should be student-designed. Completing a summer project or creating a summer project as a student would be less stress on teachers. The summer project is going to be well handled by the students. Nobody would have to worry about anybody else opinions on the summer project, since it's being handled by students. The teachers can come and watch the summer project be created by their students. On the other hand, people think that it should be done by teachers so it can be understood more. Adults would make the summer project more comprehensive to read and understand on what to do. They would know how to make the project more interesting on the topic or lesson of the summer project and not the students. It's best to trust the students at there best of work. I believe that students should design summer projects because the students would get a easy one-hundred, the kids would have more creative ideas, and there would be less stress on the teachers. On the other hand, people believe that teachers should design the summer project because they will get the project done faster, students would be in the way, and the people would understand more from teachers.",0,0.7994301915168762
"Many things today can be accomplished online without having to leave the comfort of your own home, including earning an education. Some schools currently offer distance learning to students, which is essentially attending classes from home through online classes or video conferencing. This method of learning has not yet been implemented into all schools, but it would benefit many students if it was. Offering students the option to partake in distance learning allows them to make the personal choice of what is most beneficial for them. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because distance learning may be the most covenant option for their circumstances, it would allow them to choose the learning environment that is most effective for them, and it would urge students to take on the responsibility of completing more independent work at their own pace. Being able to attend classes from home would be beneficial to students because distance learning may be the most covenant option for their circumstances. Students have different conflicts they deal with when it comes to school, and distance learning is a solution that would make attending classes more flexible for students. It would be very beneficial to some specific students if they could choose to take classes at home. Specific examples of this are a student who has a long commute to school, a student who has young siblings that they need to watch over at home, or a student who is too injured to comfortably leave their home. In all of these scenarios it would be a covenant option for the students to take classes from home. Students should have the option to attend classes from home because it would provide them with an alternative choice that could be more covenant for them, therefore benefit them greatly. Another benefit of students having the ability to choose distance learning, is it would allow them to choose the learning environment that is most effective for them. Not every student does well learning in a classroom setting, many happen to do their best work outside of school. The busy commotion of some classrooms produce a variety of learning difficulties for certain students. Some classrooms are filled with talkative students that may disrupt the well behaved students who are trying to learn. Other times, the problem may be a sociable student who is having a difficult time being productive in a classroom filled with social distractions, or a student who faces social anxiety that causes them to have issues learning in class. Some students that face difficulties like these in a classroom setting may prefer to learn in a different environment. Such as a student choosing to learn quietly at home with less social distractions, or a student choosing to work outdoors to calm their anxiety. If students were given the option of distance learning they could make the choice to attend classes from home, or anywhere else that would be most beneficial to their learning needs. Some may argue that if students were able to attend classes from home it would not benefit them since they would not be receiving the constant guidance and help that they would from a teacher in a classroom. With less frequent guidance from a teacher in a classroom, students would have to work independently more often. However, having to work independently would ultimately benefit students because it would cause them to become more responsible. Students would have to be responsible for completing their classes at home on their own time. Although students would be more independent with distance learning, they would still have a teacher for their online class that they could contact about questions they have from home. While not being in a classroom with a teacher may be a change that would take time for some students to get used to, it would not be an issue for some. Not every student needs as much assistance as others, some are quick learners that would rather learn at their own pace without a teacher helping them along every step. If students were able to choose distance learning, it would benefit them by influencing them to take on responsibility through more independent learning and working at their own pace. In conclusion, being a covenant option for some students' circumstances, allowing students to choose the learning environment that is most effective for them, and causing students to take on responsibility through more independent learning are the reasons why students would benefit from distance learning and why it is a beneficial option to provide. Whether or not distance learning would be beneficial for an individual student depends entirely on the student's circumstances, preferences, and needs. Every student learns differently and works better in different scenarios or environments, therefore attending classes from home would not affect every student the same. What may be the best option for one student, may not be the best for another. Every student should be given the opportunity to partake in distance learning if they decide it is the most beneficial option for them and improving their education.",0,0.7872492671012878
"I totally agree with the statement that ""Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well"". In our life, we have a lots of chances to face to the delimma situations. Sometime we will follow the indicatation by people who have the same experience and know the best answer. However, sometime we just take a chance even we know it might have some risks.
 
    In my opinion, I support that we should take chance in trying new thinds.First and foremost, everyday we will meet numerous of new things. If we always just fellowed the rules that were given by others,we would miss a lots of chance to learn things by ourselves.
For example, when I was child, i always copy the essay from my sister, because I know she always get high grade than me. But after I grew up, I try to write by myself, to my astonished, I found that writting is a such interesting thing. Moreover, I can learn new vocabulary and skills from writting. If I did not do it by myself , I would never find the fun of writting.

   Second, we will never know the result , it might be good or be bad.
It is life, is not it?It is more impressed if the results is came from ourselves .We can learn from the bad result and never do it again. Also remember the good results in mind, next time when we meet the same situation, we know the answer.

   Futhermore, after trying new things and getting good result, the feeling of satisfy is the most wonderful feeling in the world, Everytime I make a right dicision, I will very proud by myself and talk to everybody to share my joy. Even some of my friends wil be encouraged.

    In conclusion, I think take chance when trying new things carry more weight  than doing what they already know how to do.",0,0.7166585326194763
"Dear, TEACHER_NAME While being a student at SCHOOL_NAME, I feel that only the students who are getting into trouble should be the ones who are doing community service because I STUDENT_NAME, think it is unfair to punish the students who are doing there work and are not being childish and are acting like educated students who don't deserve this punishment. There are many discussion's with the teachers and principals, but there are many students who are doing there best and are prepared to learn. So when talking to the teachers at meetings I feel that some of the teachers should pull some students aside and ask them how they feel. With my opinion I feel that this is the best way so that all the teachers could understand us as students feel. I think it is very important for all the students who are bad to do the community service so that the next time they will know not do be bad again. This is a very hard decision being a student but i feel that it is unfair to punish the students who always do good and give no trouble. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME",0,0.6252228021621704
"The author suggest that venus is a worthy study to study because of the goods and bad things that happens on that planet.

Then it tells us that even though Mars,Earth and Venus all move at different speeds around the sun. Now the Bads things it says about venus is that in the paragraph ""Venus clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere.

"Changing the election by popular votes for the presidents of the United States is fair right? We'll it says according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency over 60 percent of the voter would prefer a direct election to the kind that we have now. Next, There are problems with the electoral college system voters vote not for a slate of electors, who inturn electthe president. Imagine if we had electoral votes it would be much easier and fair for all the people, than just rather have senate or House of Representatives have to pick, or Congress. At the most basic level,the electoral college is unfair to voters. Then, Some of the problems that we have, Because of the winner take all syste, in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning and that's a big problem focusing only on the tight races inthe ""swing"" states. It is informing us that During the 2000 there was a campaign that seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all,including states Rhode Island and South Carolina. and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't even get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voter, they have yetto make it. Last, It almost obvious the electoral college is unfair, outdatedand irrational. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It's hard to say this butBob Dole was right he said to Abolish the electoral college. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. In 1968 a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election then, In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe In conclusion, we voters have to stand up for our rights achieve our goal making this a better country and society to live in. Electoral votes should be made it is a much easier system. Changing the election by popular votes for the presidents for the United States is fair right? It is fair because it makes our country muche easier and better place to live. Some of the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. It is clearly unfair Electoral College votes should be madefor everyone to have popular votes, to vote in this country.",0,0.7111324667930603
"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", the author describes a new technology that allows computers to identify human emotions. The author also describes how this new technology can read the expressions of students in a classroom. This seems like an extremely valuable peice of technology. There are many ways that this can help students with there education. This technology can help students understand what they are learning better, which can result in a better education. For example, this technology can help a student that is having difficulty on a lesson they are learning just by identifying there emotions. In paragraph six of the article it states, that a class computer can identify when a student is becoming bored or if the student is having trouble understanding the material, then the technology can change up the lesson so that the student does not get bored or confused. This results in a better education for students. With this type of technology students will be more educated and that will help future generations to come. In the article, the author describes to us, this new technology, Facial Action Coding System, which can identify human emotions. This is indeed valuable to students in classrooms. This tech can read students emotions and modify the lesson, so that the student understands the material. the Facial Action Cosing System will soon be essential for learning in the future so that students can be more educated for when they are out in the real world. With this tech students will soon have an education that is right for them.",0,0.7551919221878052
"""Innovation is mother of Success""
I strongly support the prompt that successful people try new things rather than only doing what already know how to do well.Surely,success comes to those who try new things.

""Risk is another name of success.""If one takes risk to invest in a new bussiness then two conditions take birth.First one is that he will earn profit for himself which is positive aspect of the risk taken.But on the other hand there is equal probability of his failure which is a negative aspect.In my opinion,both of them can't  be stated as success.Because what real success is to learn from failure and then again hit your target,but this time with full preparation and timing.Then I am sure that the person will not loose again.This implies that  a person learns from his failure.

Yes, I agree that,success comes to those who try new things and with a proper planning.But its not only trying new things without even pondering over it.If a person takes risk to gamble then its his luck that will win one time or two but its not that he will win always.Its just wasting maoney and above all time.So risk should be taken in a right direction. It should not in vague direction.

Let's have an example of the great industrialist  of India Late DhiruBhai Ambani, founder of Reliance Group.In his early career he only tried his hand in textiles and he succeeded which encouraged him to try in other fields too.He tried and got a victory over all the fields he invested in. This can't be stated as luck rather it was the risk taken by him and the planning which gave him the crown of victory.

To conclude.I would state that its not trying new things which gains you victory but the planning and hardwork along with risk.Blend othis could make anybody a ""winner"".   ""Success is taking risk at proper time with proper planning and hardwork.""",0,0.8996519446372986
"Dear TEACHER_NAME, I think that community service would be a good idea. It would help people out that are less fortunate then us. It would help elderly people or people that can't do much. It would also maybe help us learn about how lucky we actually are to have a house, and clothes, and food to eat everyday. It would be a good idea but a lot of people wouldn't wanna do it. So if you made it small things or things that didn't take a lot of time to do then it would probably work. And maybe like each month if you got a certain amount of hours or did a certain amount of things then you could get a prize. I think more people would do that if they knew they could get a prize. Plus you shouldn't tell the kids when they have to do it, you should let them pick because a lot of kids have sports like me. And when i get out of practice I'm tired so I would not wanna have to do community service. And a lot of kids are busy so letting them decide when to do it would be a good idea. And that would encourage more people to do it. We could do such things as rake leaves, shovel snow, help out elderly people with needs, or even pick up trash on the road. We could even do things here in our school like help stack books in the library, help pick up trash in the hall ways, or even help clean up the lunch room on Fridays like some people do. In conclusion I think it would be a good idea and many people would benefit from this. I think that it would also change our lives as well as many people that we would be helping. We would also be making our community a better place to live in and many people would be thankful for our help.",0,0.7251424789428711
"It is good to ask for advice from multiple people instead of one person because if you are in a such a horrible situation that could end up with you and a loved one saying nasty things at each other that you dont really mean. You would need advice from multiple people to prevent that happening because if you go to you one of your closest friends asking for their advice, but they might accidentally give you the wrong advice with out meaning too. Asking for multiple different people's advice can give you different opinions, and backup advice. If you receive several different opinions it could help you make a good decision based on your situation. For example if you only ask one person for advice on how to study for a big test, but instead of giving you good advice on how to study that person accidentally gave you bad advice and you end up failing that test. But if you asked 3 different people for advice and two people recommend one similar way to study, and the other person recommended a completely different way to study then chose the most recommended way to study for the test because most likely those to people used the same strategies and did really well. Having backup advice will help if the advice you took in the first place doesnt work. Then you have other advice to fall back on. Here is an example: If you are starting a new business for the first time and you go to a two different people who have already started a business and person number one said ""Work on getting a facility to work in"", and person number two said ""make as much money as possible first"". You go with person number one's advice which is to get a facility to work in. The advice that you went with didn't work very well, so you go to advice number two which is to make as much money as possible and that advice worked wonderfully. Its always good to have backup advice that you can use if the original fails. Seeking diferenent people's advice can help you in multiple ways like having different opinions, and backup advice to use if the original advice fails. Asking for advice is a great thing but sometimes people get bad advice so receiving multiple people's advice is better then just one person's advice.",0,0.8608033061027527
"I hear you are reconsidering the school's cell phone policy. I know you are considering two possible policies: Policy 1: Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free time, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. Policy 2: Do not allow students to have phones at school at all. I think that you should possibly consider policy 1. There are three reasons why I think you should consider policy 1. The students will not be disturbing anyone, they could communicate with their friends and they could communicate with their parents. First, they would not be disturbing any one. Most of the time if they are in class, and their phones go off then it would disturb other students around them. If they are in lunch they would not disturb anyone. No one in lunch would be testing or studying. Even in a free period, students would not be disturb. Second, they could communicate with their friends. If one friend is in lunch and another friend is in a free period, then they could text each other. They wouldn't bother anyone as I said before. They could just text among each other. Lastly, they could communicate with their parents. If a student forgot a project at home, then in lunch they could just ask their parents to bring it to them. Some teachers might not allow the students to use the school phone. Even if the parent want to inform their child of something. It would be easier to just text them or call them in lunch. In conclusion, reconsidering policy one might be a good idea. They can communicate with friends, families, and they would not disturb anyone. I believe this policy is better. I hope you can understand my point of view. I also hope you could just at least reconsider.",0,0.7429938316345215
"your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. for example, students could participate in sports, work on the yearbook, or serve on the student council. do you agree or disagree with this decision? use specific details and examples to convince others support your position. i agree because students who do not like to do sports or anything at all its good for them to do something to keep them busy and occupied. And someone should at least convince them to try something new in sports. when i was younger my mom always told me that i should do basketball. Because i wasn't doing a after school sport at all and i didnt like sports at the time. So we talked about doing it and i tried it i kind of liked it it was fun because of the basketball drills and got to meet new friends on the team. after that i started doing flag football, and tackle football and i enjoyed it and i was always busy and occupied. i think students who don't do any sports should try it. because it will keep you busy and you would enjoy it because you meet new friends and its very competitive. other than that it will keep you from being on your phone and staying home all day bored when you can be out having fun playing sports. And also sports would make you think about what you wanna do in the future if you really like sports and good at it. It would also make your family proud of you because of all the hard work you did to get this opportunity. But it also takes time to be good at something only if you try. because thats the only way to get somewhere.",0,0.7281553149223328
