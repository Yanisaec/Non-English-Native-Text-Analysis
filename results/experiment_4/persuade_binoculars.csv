15772,0,"Dear Principal, If you played on a team wouldn't you want to have good, honest citizens? Why would you want to play with the people who get bad grades and invariably get in trouble? I know I wouldn't want to. To play on a team there should have to be only the people who get good grades. I believe that if you are on a team that you should have to have good grades and a spectacular record. One reason why I think people should have to get good grades to be on a team is because that way you only get the dedicated students. I say that because if they have to get a B- average you better they probably have to work hard to be on the team. That is a good thing because then they will be dedicated to their team and their school. Also I think it is like that in college, all the super good athletes in college have to get good grades to play. If they don't get good grades then they can't play. It should be like that in middle and high school. If the athletes want to be on the team they have to get good grades. A recent study said that if a school has this policy the school's grade point average is 24 percent higher than school without. That is quite a significant jump up and I think it shouldn't be ignored. Another reason I think that we should do that is because then you get good all- around citizens. If they have to get good grades then they are dedicated to their school. Also if the athletes play then they are dedicated to their team. When or if the school changes that policy, I think we should also add that the athletes have to have a good behavior record. That way they have to get good grades, be an athlete, and good behavior. Add that up and you get an all-around good person. I believe that our school should change that policy to a B- average. That way they have to be dedicated to their school and their team. Other people might say that you will get a smaller turnout. Yeah, but that is a good thing because then you"
15742,0,I agree with the principal that students must have a B average if they want to play a sport. They should have a B average because if students get like a C and there in a sport they wouldn't bother to do there homework. They would mostly be focus on the sport there in then focusing on there own learning at school. It would be better do have students wit B average for then they could know if they get a C or something they wouldn't be able to be in the sport that they want to be in. If the students don't have a B average i think that's good that they wouldn't get to play a sport because then if they know they cant play a sport then they would know that they need to bring up there grades for they could play the sport that they want to play. Also that the principal should just tell them if you want to be in a sport you need to bring up your grades or else you cant play the sport that you want to play in. If the students decide to not bring there grades up then that's there choice. The principal should like convince the students to get there grades up for they could play the sport that they want to play. I know that some students would bring there grades up because they do want to play the sport that they want to play. Its good that the principal wants to change the school policy. So yes i agree with the principal that he should change the school policy for the students could know that they need to get there grades up. The students should listen to the school policy rule if they change it. The policy would help the students because the students would have good grades and they would like the sport that there in. the principal should change it and
23698,0,"Almost a 30% of high school students have more responsibilities than others, such as pay bills, and start saving money for college. Some schools are offering distance learning as an option for students, which means that they could attend classes from home by online or by video conferencing. Students think that they would get benefits by being able to attend this program. The truth is that students will not get benefits by attending this program because they will have more responsibilities, less social life, and more access to social media. By attending this program students will have more responsibilities than they usually do, since they will have more time to spend working or doing other things, they will easily forget about if they have homework or projects to do. Even though, some students will get what they actually want, it will not be the same for them, because if they do not understand something, it will not going to be the same to ask a teacher than to ask an online teacher. However, students that want to attend this program will always have to be thoughtful about what things they need to be doing, and what things are more important than others. Also students will have less social life, doing this program they will not have many friends as they could have attending regular school, and if they have there is a huge possibility that they will not have the same age and they will not be always on the same path or alike. Thus, they will not have many friends to do enjoyable things, or someone to share great things with, and it will be hard for them to get used to this program. Last, students will have more access to social media, during the time that they are taking online classes or video conferencing they have to be using a laptop or a desk computer, and also internet. Using a computer and internet will lead them to have access to social media during classes, and it will be a distraction for them, because they will not be putting complete effort to their classes. Although, students will have more time to be doing exactly want, such as work, and hobbies. It will not going to be the same because they will not have many friends as they would like to have to do and share amazing things. In conclusion, taking online classes or by video conferencing, it will never going to be the same that attend a regular school, because students will have more responsibilities than they used to, at one point they will feel lonely, and they will not be putting complete effort because they will have more access to social media during classes."
19576,0,"Dear Senator, While it is unfair, the Electoral College should still be used. There are some problems with the way it works, but it would still be easier than having presidential elections by popular vote. One of the reasons why the Electoral College should still be used is the certainty of the outcome. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible - it happened in 2000 - but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes - 538 - is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. Secondly, the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by the virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. The Electoral College also avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. At the most basic level, however, the Electoral College is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. Aside from it being a little unfair, the Electoral College does its best to elect a President, which is why it should still be kept."
14431,0,"Dear Principal, Community service. It sounds really nice to do, right? Wrong! I have done community service before and it is torture. If you do one act of kindness then you will find yourself doing 70 acts of kindness in six seconds. I am talking from experience. There are a billion reasons I could give you why community service is a bad idea, but I'll stick with just one. First, it takes away from your own activities. After school I go to hockey practice. Three years ago when I had community service, I couldn't do that. Community service started out as a five minute thing about once a day. After a few months I was up to my head and then some with community service. I helped my community for seven hours every single day! School is six hours. I did community service more than I went to school. I barely had time to eat. Or breath! I cleaned up so many beaches that I thought that I had solved the world's pollution problem! Helping your community is great. But it gets out of control. So Principal, don't force us to do community service and make us lose our lives. Let us just do little things and all pitch in every now and then. I have learned that you try harder at things when you do it as your choice, rather than being forced to do it."
12596,0,"It makes sense that people think this is evidence of an ancient civilization, but according to NASA they wish it was. Nowadays, with science fiction rapidly advancing it's hard to not imagine or want aliens and any sort of other life to exist because of how extraordinary it would be. Up until today NASA hasn't found any life out there, but they want to and all the other science enthusiasts do aswell. If this was a clue to other life out there, just stumbling upon this was way too easy. Obviously, others like this have been found, meaning this isn't anything more special than a natural landform. If aliens really did exist there is a small chance NASA would just easily stumble upon evidence like this one because if this was real it's too good to be true. Realistically, there's so much reasoning from the experts themselves proving that this isn't anything unusual. First of all there's a thing called shadows and they can easily turn a natural figure into looking like some human-like structure. NASA will literally use technology we don't have access to such as more high-tech cameras to find out things no one ever knew existed. Obviously there are landforms like a butte or mesa meaning this isn't something never found. In fact there's one in Idaho called the,""Snake River Plain of Idaho"". When just ordinary people just make an inference it doesn't mean it's true. When thinking about who finds out all the things and goes up to see the things that occur in space it's NASA. Honestly they are the smarter ones, so there's nothing some regular people with opinions can prove. When the picture was shown it shows the landform started to change or deform, meaning if the structure is able to do such a thing looking like a face had no purpose. If it these are signs of an ancient civilization wouldn't there be more evidence discovered by now or wouldn't there be more of these near?"
3736,0,"Every summer break, students are given projects in certain classes to make sure they continue to improve over the break. These projects handed out to the students are always made by the teachers, but what if we change that? Students should one hundred percent be the ones who plan out and create their own summer projects. One reason students should be allowed to create their own summer break projects is because, they know exactly what they need to improve on to be ready for the following year. Students know what they struggled with and what they were good at during the school year. Teachers can not always grasp what a student may need in order to keep improving. In order for students to recieve any sort of benefit from the summer project, is if they make it themselves. If I was able to make my own summer project with my classmate I would know what needed to be included in order for me to succeed. Another reason students would make the summer projects more productive is that, teachers tend to make assignments very long, hard, time consuming, and usually very boring. Teachers can overstep because it may not seem like a lot of work to them, but to the students, it is. They can put in too much information which can make it less benificial to the students. Doing a project over summer break that is not productive, is a huge waste of time. Students might be more willing and excited to do their summer projects if they create it themselves because it will be something they all enjoy doing. Most people I know, including me dont start even looking at the projects that the teachers give to us until the night before schools starts, but if we as students create our own we already know what we have to accomplish. Due to the amount of excitment for their projects, there will be a large increase in the number of students who complete the task and get a good grade, which starts the school year off on a good note. I always tend to work best and work harder on the subjects and or topics I enjoy the most. I would also complete my work in full if it was intresting to me. Students deserve a long, stressless summer, but with the teacher's stressful assignments, that might not always happen for them. All students deserve a say in what they do with their time over their own break. It is fair to them and the teachers. The summer break projects created by the students will be more productive, less time consuming and more fun for everyone."
23145,0,"Education is a driving force which motivates individuals around the world to work for their goals. Most people receive education in a classroom setting, whether that is in a school, university, etc. However many people around the world do not have the ability to travel to a school everyday in order to pursue an education. As a result, some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home via online or video conferencing. Students would benefit from having the ability to take classes from their home because it allows them to pursue an education if they cannot find transportation to school, limits distraction, and provides students with a more flexible schedule. Many individuals who wish to pursue an education are unable to because of their lack of transportation, however, through the option of distance learning an education is within reach for most people. For example, kids who cannot find transportation to and from school everyday can now take classes within the comfort of their own home. Transportation is no longer an issue for those who desire an education. Students can also avoid distractions,such as appearance and large numbers of peers, by taking classes in their own home. This allows students to truly prioritize learning if they wish to do so. In addition, students are not bothered with the stress of fitting in. By removing these pressures and distractions the productivity of a student will increase. The schedule of the average high school student is very hectic, but when distance learning is implemented the chaos that they experience can be avoided. For example, the average high school student spends about six hours in school, two hours participating in extracurricular activities, and two hours doing homework. All of this work must be crammed into an extremely tight window of time in order to allow time for a sufficient amount of sleep. However, when distance learning is utilized students can take classes and complete the designated work at their convenience. This allows for more time to focus on personal growth, participate in hobbies, and sleep. All of these are very important to the development of an individual outside of an academic setting, and distance learning makes it possible for students to dedicate more time to these activities rather than strictly academics. Although the benefits of distance learning outweigh the negatives some still argue that distance learning isn't effective. While some say that distance learning will lead to a decrease in productivity and effort in an academic setting they are not entirely correct. Distance learning may not confine students to an academic setting for ten hours a day, but it does ensure that the student learns the material and is able to apply it to real-life situations. Productivity should also increase because students have more time to focus on personal health and other activities which they enjoy. In conclusion, distance learning is a great opportunity which holds many benefits for students. Through the use of distance learning students have the ability to pursue an education no matter where they live. They can also dedicate more of their day to personal growth in a non-academic context while still working towards obtaining an education. Students are also able to eliminate any distractions which they may find in a general classroom setting. All in all, distance learning provides students with the chance to pursue an education while also focusing on themselves as people."

When asking for advice asking multiple people is good for more ideas, better opinions, and a better approach. When asking for advice you can find out more ideas. More ideas can help business wise. With more ideas businesses can find out more ways to expand. More ideas are good for planning. If you're planning a family trip you can more ideas on where to go. More ideas can help with handling situations. You can ask people on how to better handle a situation. With more ideas you can better form opinions. Asking for advice is like asking for better opinions. With better opinions you can help someones love life. When a friend is dealing with a heart break you can give them opinions on what they should do. With better opinions you can help run a business. If you're a worker you can give your opinions on why you should get a raise. When at school you might want the school rules to change. You can tell the principle your opinions and what should change and, he might take what you said into consideration. With better opinions you can have a better approach. With more ideas and, better opinions your approach can be better. You can ask your teacher for advice. When asking your teacher for advice you can better your schooling. You can ask your family members for advice. Asking your family for advice can help you in many ways like your personal problems, schooling, or bullying. Asking your friends for advice is great help too. Asking your friends for advice is goof for when your sad or need help in general. When asking for advice you get a better approach from a lot of people. Advice can come from anyone and the more people you ask the better. Asking for advice is a great way to get more ideas, better opinions, and a better approach. When asking for opinions who might you ask to help?"
20531,0,"Dear Mr. Senator, I believe that the way our elections are run are not what is best for the United States. The Electoral College is changing the way that we originally set out to vote and is making things unfair for the citizens who vote. I propose that the Electoral College is taken away all together in order for elections to be more fair, and more like the original intention of the U.S. With most states following the winner takes all idea, the winner of the general public may not be the candidate that wins the elections. These times are rare, but they happened before there is nothing that is stopping them from happening again. A lot of voters who are not very well educated may not even understand what the electoral college is or what they are actually voting for when they vote. Instead of voting for the candidate that they want as the next president, they are voting for a group of electors that decide who will win. Sometimes, the electors that are assigned to that candiadate will not vote for them. This process also seems to disriciminate against the less populated states because they don't have as much a say in the college and are often forgoten in the rush of propaganda and aren't really aware of who they should pick and why they should pick them. In The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradfor Plumer, Plumer explains that one of the best arguments against the Electoral College is that the rate of disaster is so high. In 2000, there was a elctoral crisis based upoun the Electoral College, because Al Gore recieved more individual votes, but George W. Bush still won the election. Another reason that this process is so unstable is the way that it makes voters feel about voting. In large states, where this a majority of either republican or democrats, voters may think that if they are in the minority, and the other party will surely win the election, what's the point of voting. If there was no Electoral College, the votes that they put in could contribute to the greater pool of that parties voters, while with Electoral College the votes are pointless and basically disapear. That, to me, is robbing the citizens of the U.S. of thir right to vote. According to Richard A. Posner, the Electoral College restores some of the weight that the large states hold in a presidental election. However, the large states may not have all of one party and those other votes can really make a difference. Some argue that a few votes can not do a lot and that the Electoral College is a far more organized way to conduct the voting. But every vote counts, and if every voter understood why they were voting for who they were voting for then the president may be a majority favorite. It seems unfair that the president of the United States, the most important man in the country, is not truely picked by the voters, but by the Elctoral College. The Office of the Federal Register says that the electors that are selected are chosen by the candidates political party but that stae laws differ on how they are specifically selected. This way does not seem like the best way of performing the task and I can see how it results in issues. Trusting the weight of the United Stated on the the backs iof only 538 electors is not the most stable way to perform an election. Why trust a select group with this descion if the whole United States can contribute to it? I think that it is criticall that we change the idea of an Electoral College to the idea that all of the people in the United States are able to contribute equally to who should be the next president based on what they believe is right. Bradford Plummer believes that one of the most worrying thoughts is that there will be a tie with the electors. If that were to occur the elction would fall into the hands of the House of Representitives, resulting in all the states, no matter what their population is, having the same amount of votes, casuing a president that may be very far away than what the majority of the United States actually wants. This may seem unlikely but in fact there have already been many close calls. In 1968, only 41,971 votes would have deadlockes the election. In 1976 a tie would have happened if 5,559 voters in Hawaii, and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way (The Indefensibel Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong, by Bradofrd Plummer.) A tie may occur and if it does, A lot of citizens would be very upset that the president did not win by popularity, but by the Electoral College. There are many reasons that the Elctoral College is unfair to the voters of the U.S. State inequality, diaster, ties, and people loosing the urge to vote. The list goes on and on and if this doesn't make you see what is wrong with this system than I don't know what will. I hope you take this information to good use and use it to tear down this unfair system once and for all. If we really want to be a democracy, than we have to do away with this system. Many of Americans believe that this is the best way and several have published interesting papers on that topic that may chaneg the minds of people who are still for it. I hope this dream to get rid of the unfair and terrible system that is the Electoral College is accomplished soon. Sincerely, A Concerned Citizen"

Youre not just going to want to just sit there akwardly and do nothing while your car does all the work. Many people are going to think that this is a great idea till they start to understand the actually danger it puts you in. Driveless cars need to be put to a stop before many people become injured. This is a horrible idea. Why would someone start to put many lives in danger? All they are doing is basically saying you just have to sit there and let the car do the work. What happens to the people if they accidently fall asleep because they're not doing anything? They're going to die or get seriously hurt. Then the company is the people who are going to end up in a bunch of trouble because they are leading people to these when they're just hurting them. The driveless cars aren't so driveless. You have to be alert at all times because the car cant make it through a traffic jam or any other roadblocks. in conclusion, the driveless care wouldnt be a smart idea. It could end badly for both the person who buys it and the company who sold it. The driveless car seems to have more harm than good when you could easily just drive the car yourself. Driving the car yourself would lead to making this easiser onyourself. You dont have to worry about falling asleep by just sitting there. Driveless cars aren't so driveless!"

Its all stupid they saying things to make eachother look bad but that the end of the day no one is perfect. So what he did in his passed and in high school is just pointless to bring up. As teens and kids we do stuoid stuff but we do grow up so why bring it back up to make you feel better about your self. this is what i really dont get we the people are suppost to vote to see who will be leading us for the next four years but we really are not. We all vote but then if the electoral college chocies some one else that who it is so what is the point in us votin. If even when we the people vote for this person and he wins with us and yall want the other guy he wins thats not fair to him or us. It should be popular votes take all. did you know that when you vote for your canidate you are actally voting for your candidates electors. Then our governor prepares a certificate of ascertainment they all so decllare the winning presidential candidate. I think its all just not worth it all that work for what if we could just vote on who we want and the person that gets the most votes wins. I dont understnd why this have to have all that other stuff that is not needed. They say the electoral college restpres some of the weight in the political balance. They have 538 electors whats the point if we the people could just vote why i really dont understand whats the need for them the person with most votes wins i dont see why all that other stuff is nesseasy. I know you people probley think im crazy but i dont care it just dont seem to me like there is apoint for all of that this is just how i see it in y point of veiw
1575,0,"There are many advantages of limiting your car usage and it too can help the Earth. Limiting car usage can be very helpful towards your health and your environment around you. Elisabeth Rosenthal, Robert duffer and Andrew selsky has all written down thier opnions down suggesting for more people to use bikes, buses or even walking to help people use less cars. Why, would anyone walk but have easier transport by driving a car? because by walking you being saving money and lowering down pollution that is in the air. In In German Suburb, Life goes on without cars written by Elisabeth Rosenthal; she is explaining how in Vauban,Germany is a ""car-free"" city and if you own a car owership you would have to pay a lot of money just for a space in your home for you car. Elisabeth has eclaimed that "" Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park-large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home"". This quote is showing how by owning your own car can cause too much money in a place that doen'st allow cars but when they do allow cars, you have to pay double of the price of a normal car. There is also something else that is interesing that Elisabeth has also stated: ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car- intensive areas in the United States"". This quote is showing us that cars waste too much gas and it goes up into our greenhouse and it is destroying our planet. If the percent number keeps going up, our earth can be harmful. Also, by not using your car, it can lower down rush-hours and traffice. As stated in this quote by Andrew Selsky written in Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in bogota: "" Rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffice; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"". That is very good for the people because they would getting plenty of exerices while walking and they would not have to deal with beeping cars behind them or being stuck in the same place for couples of hours. If more people people come into walking or riding bikes to their homes,schools,or jobs; the bike places would get a lot of money for their bikes and that is good because the car dealership places would get less money and would close down. This quote from The end of car culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal reflects how the bike shops would get new priorities: ""New York's new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation"". This is showing how paying for a bike would benefit you and the planet by not buying a car that is polluting the air. Finally, Paris has been noticing smog going everywhere in france and needs to do something about it so they enforced a partial driving ban to clear up the air. As stated in this quote by Robert Duffer who has written Paris bans driving due to smog, ""Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has... [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline"". This quote is explaining how using up too much gasoline can lead to serious problems like having heavy smog everywhere in the country. That only does France have heavy smog but Paris does have the most smog, other European countries as well as stated in this quote: ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals...[Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic metere compared with 144 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found""(Duffer). Having so much smog that you aren't able to see toward can be very dangrous. In concluson, Being able to save your money, and help out the Earth can always be a good thing. Polluting the air can lead to many problems in the future and that could damage many lives and places. Always know how to respect your planet by always using less gas or no gas at all. Biking and walking can lead to a better future and it would turn out better than using a car."
24675,0,"When people ask for advice, there is a possibility that they will go to more than one person for advice. We all have given and gotten advice. Opinions have a big impact on people, with the advice given to us we can make the right choice. I think that people seek advice from multiple people because the person being asked could have experienced it already or the person asking doesn't know what to do in their situation so they ask multiple people so they can make the right choice. One reason I think people go seek advice from multiple people because the person being asked could have experienced it already. There are some people in this world that have done much experiencing in their lives. For example I like to have fun, be adventurous, and try new things but my sister is not like that. My sister likes to stay indoors and not do anything fun, so she hasn't really experienced much. Therefore, when it comes to asking for advice she goes to people that she knows has experienced things around that topic so she can make the best choice. I think people go seek advice from multiple people because the person being asked could have experienced it already. My last reason I think people go seek advice from multiple people because they might be stuck in a sticky situation and not know what's the best choice. Someone could have their own personal problem and need advice to make the best choice. If I was stuck in a situation like that I would've asked my friends, family, and acquaintances to give me advice and help me figure out the best choice. Depending on a persons problem or situation I would give them advice on how to make the best choice or how I made my choice if I went through the same thing. I think people go seek advice from multiple people because they might be stuck in a sticky situation and not know what's the best choice. In conclusion, I think that people seek advice from multiple people because the person being asked could have experienced it already or the person asking doesn't know what to do in their situation so they ask people so they can make the right choice. I think getting advice from people is pretty important. If I never asked for advice, I would be so lost in the world because I would be making both bad and good decisions. Everyone has there own advice and opinion so by getting only one persons advice you could make the wrong choice. I think that getting multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice."

People could argue that the effort of studying Venus is useless and ineffective. However, scientists have little to no knowledge of how the planets in our solar system were made. Scientists could have more knowledge of Venus if they found a way to study the planet. The author of the article is right about the exploration of Venus being a worthy pursuit. The author of the article does mention how difficult it is to study Venus by bringing up the planet's harsh atmosphere in Paragraph 3. Which further proves his point how valuable it is to study Venus. He also points out that Venus may have been a lot like Earth a long time ago in Paragraph 4. This doesn't just further our understanding of Venus, but it may also give us more information about Earth as well. In Paragraph 5, the author mentions NASA's plans on how to study Venus. He does mention that those plans may have challenges fo their own in Paragraph 6. The author pushes to try those plans out in a realistic manner. The author being realistic with the reader, makes the reader want agree with him more. The author backs up his suggestion with great evidence, but does it in a realistic way. He realizes how dangerous it is to study, but pushes for it by bringing up how little we know about Venus. The author's suggestion is correct and scientists need to find a way to study Venus."

What's it going to hurt if you have it on silent or if you could use it when the teacher is not giving incrustation to the class. Because cell is another way to communicate with you friends instead for calling them you could just text them. Also at lunch you could just text your friends with out going over to them and talking it's much easy to do that. If the teachers don't let you have your phone in class that's dumb because people love there cell phones and use them all the time and teachers take them away because your not supposed to have them out but if you could have them when she/he is not talking or doing a lesson so we should be allowed to use them in those reasons and if them give homework do the homework first and then use your phone as long as you have permission to use them. So really both of them are not the greatest policy's in the world I don't agree with either one of the policy's I agree with the one I just wrote, just not having phones in school is dumb and only having them your at lunch and other free time that's boring. Come on if the teachers have them out why cant we? Are there just better than us and can do what they want. So for that i think we have them out when teachers and not giving incrustations or giving out homework thank you for taking the time to read this Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME"
21138,0,dear TEACHER_NAME i think the you should let students use their cell phones during free times like lunch time and in class when their teacher give them free time in class or during the morning because i think it's not fair because only teacher can use their phones and not us because what if we get an emergency call like the teacher and we have to go home because that's what the teachers do when they get and emergency call they get sub and go home what if something like that happens to us what if someone has and a emergency like get hurt in p-e time or something else because that's why we get phones for an emergency so that's why i believe is better to let student's use their cell phones on free time or lunch time or an emergency call because something might happen on time or they want to talk to their friends on my space or internet to talk to their cousins or family or want to call their family to know what are they doing or if they are ok or if they need enything or if their parents are going to pick them up after school or have an appointment with the doctor and i think their phones need to turn off when they need to when the teacher tells them to turn them off because other students are going to get distracted and might not pay attention on what there doing and they are not are going to do
20832,0,"Dear TEACHER_NAME, I believe that if you decide to change our school's cell phone policy, then you should choose to allow students to have phones at school but only use them outside of class. I think that not allowing students to have their phones at all is an awful idea. We need phones at school in case something goes wrong. What if I get hurt in an area of the building where nobody is? I need a way to contact someone to let them know where I am and what has happened so I can get help. Also, having a phone at school is necessary because my parents might try to contact me and tell me something important such as schedule changes, family emergencies, and so on. If I do not have a phone, then I cannot know something that is very important until it might be too late. I know that you think students will use their phones in class when they should be learning and paying attention to the teacher. All you need to solve this problem are stricter teachers who will not allow this to happen and will catch it if it does, and your students to have a sense of honor. Most of us know what the right thing to do is, we just do not always do it because of peer pressure, desire for popularity, a good laugh, etc. We have enough time to use our phones when it is allowed, so why would we need to risk getting in trouble when we could just wait until class is over? I believe that if you give us the privilege to have our cell phones with us at school, we will obey your guidelines very strictly and will not let you down. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME"
7147,0,"Have you ever done an extracurricular activity? Did you like it? My principal has decided that everyone must take part in an extracurricular activity. I disagree with his decision because some students may not have time, no one to take them, or not enough money. Students may not have enough time to do everything they need to do and go somewhere. Sometimes they have to finish their studying, homework, and go to a game or practice. They could also have a job or have to help out on a farm. For example, I had so much homework and studying to do, but I could not get it all done and go to practice. As a result I stayed home and did my homework and studying instead of going to practice. Because I did not have enough time, I could not do an extracurricular activity. Some students do not have someone to take them to games and practices. Their parents may not be able to take them because they work late or they have to go somewhere after work. One time my mom had to work late but, I also had cheer practice. Because I had no one to take me to practice, I had to stay home and miss a practice. Some times students can not participate because their families do not have enough money. Their parents need money so they can take them to and from places; also, they have to pay to get in games and for insurance. One time I wanted to do dance, but I could not do it because we did not have enough money. Because we did not have enough money to pay for it, I was not able to do an extracurricular activity. My principal recently decided that every student must do an activity. I do not agree with this because students may not have time, no one to take them, or enough money. I think his decision is not completely thought out."
15336,0,"Dear, principal I was just reading your paper on how students have to have a B average to play sports and be in activities around school. I understand how you want your students to be smart and to participate in school activities and i some what agree with you. If you want the sports players to have good grades then you should set up, a study hall type thing for the sports players so that they could work their way up to good grades and even for regular students, but if u just have people that have good grades chances are that you won't have a very good sports team in any sport, unless you get lucky and get someone with good grades that is a athlete. Also, i agree with the one where you have to have a B average to participate in the activities only if you have good grades, because a lot of kids would start doing better if they got a reward every week that they turned in their work and had straight A' s or B' s. I, also believe that everyone in the world should do their work and get straight B' s or even straight A' s, because it not hard as long as you apply yourself to get good grades. Sincerely, A Student from School P.S You should set up a activity for the student that do good."
13680,0,"Dear TEACHER_NAME, I think community service is a very good thing to do whether your in school or not. But I really think that community service should only be for students that want to help out. Others may not want to help at all. But that's not on the teacher or principal to tell you to do community service because as a student you have the right to voice your opinion on what you want or don't want to do. So its really up to you to do the right thing. if you may not want to then fine its a choice not a demand. Other examples are like if you do community service you get extra points on your report cards. Or on grades. There many ways to do community service but the topic of choice I choose is on school. This is how i feel about community service and how it should be handled"
14424,0,Community Service Dear Principal I am requesting that all the kids in the school should only do community service if optional. I am requesting this because not all kids want to help others or they are too busy to do anything else in there schedule. The kids in the school shouldn't be forced to do something they don't want to do. However if community service is something a kid wants to do it should be their own choice to decide. I believe that community service should be optional because some kids are lazy or they just don't have a lot of time. The kids who are lazy and don't want too do community service are usually at home doing homework or hanging out friends. They believe that helping others is not something that they want to do. A lot of these kids probably don't want to help out other people because they are not getting paid. A lot of kids these days only help out others or there parents because of a salary or allowance. The kids who are too busy on the other hand have no time to do community service. These kids focus on certain actives that take up there entire day. Some activities can be playing a instrument or having gymnastics or dance lessons. These kids focus and devote a lot of time to these activities because they want it to be their career when they grow up. The kids who want to become musicians probably would want to get into a music school such as LaGuardia or Juliard to further there musical career. Anyways Mr. Principal I believe that if a kid wants to do community service they can do a lot of things. They can help clean up wildlife or plant more trees which is good for the environment. They can also work in nursery homes or help out fellow teachers at there school. When someone wants to do community service they can do a lot of things. It can be simple things like helping out neighbor which brings joy to the person. Mr. Principal I believe that Community service should be optional not mandatory. People have different reasons not to help out others. Some may be just lazy or some don't have time. Anyways Mr. Principal I hope you can take my suggestions into consideration and not make Community service mandatory.

Being abble to hide emotions from onthers is not that hard, you van put on a smile and act happy around others and be different be yourself happenes all the time with teens and young adults. Will the machine be able to detect that? Or will it show the outer emotions rather than inner. This may help a lot of schools witth kids who dont like sharing their feelings, but at what cost will it take fot them to make kids go out and do this? Will it be something thats mandatory or will it be a choice? Thats the question we need to be asking, will it help teens and kids overcome feelings they dont like sharing or will it hurt them even more knowing they felt something that they have been denying all along. Also how do we know if thats correct? In the article it only used an example thats not even a person who is breathing, they used a painting so why spend an upwards of 5,000 dollars on something that may or may not work depending on the situation. Students get told all the time by teachers, parents, and a lot of other people that expressing their feelings is very important and to do it to someone they trust. Will this take that away the connection between two people sharing feelings, will we turn intoa society that relies on a machine to tell us our emotions? In mu opinion schools shouldnt make or even give this option to students it is giving them an ""escape"" to talking about their feelings, will it be worth it in the end? To turn our next generation that its okay not to tell how we feel. isnt that the same as being sort of ""robotic"". My parents stress the improtance of showing and talking about emotions and how it makes people closer, now they want to trow that away for a machine. I also see it being sort of like an alternative counsilier because you go see your counsilier about how your feeling and isnt that technically what this machine is doing? We need to stick with human interactions, having that is what makes us a society of poeple who care about one another. Once you introduce something with more machinerey yo introduce more kids who are antiscoical and dont want to go outside or play sports. There is a time when technology gets to be too muchand this is one of those times. Lets stop it before we even begin."
3920,0,"Teacher-Designed or Student-Designed Summer Projects Summer is a time for students to take a break and relax from school, but many classes are making students preform a summer project. Summer projects are given to students to allow them to continue learning even when not in school. The projects push students to work hard all year long. Summer projects are also easy ways for students to work hard and achieve a great score for classes. If a student does well on their summer project, then the teacher will recognize the student is committed and focused on school even when not in the classroom. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because they will keep the students on task, push the students to learn, and will prepare students for future year long jobs. A reason why summer projects should be teacher-designed is because they will keep the students on task. On the other hand if the project was to be student-designed then students could easily be sent off track. There are a lot of summer activities that students would like to do, and if a student is only focused on fun activities then the student will not focus on the assigned project. The teacher-designed projects will keep the student on task and give them a way to work on the project but still be able to have fun during their summer break. Keeping the students on task is important and not allowing them to push the project off is a great reason why the teacher-designed project is a better idea. Another reason explaining why summer projects should be teacher-designed is because it will push the student to learn. If the students are not learning anything from the project then there would be not reason why to have the project assigned to begin with. The students would learn a lot more if the project was made at a teacher standard because it would be just like a test or classwork, but made into a large project for the student. Learning from the project would be very beneficial for the student because they are given a whole summer to work on the project which allows them to learn the material at a slow and steady pace. This is a great reason why the summer project should be teacher-designed and not student-designed. The last reason why the summer projects should be teacher-designed is because they will prepare the students for future year long jobs. Most jobs are year long and by giving the students the summer projects they are learning what it is it like to work year long. The students are basically going to be working all year long once they are given their summer projects. This is going to prepare them for what it is like to work all year long once they have a job. Even though the students are given a long time to work on the project, and will still have more of a break than a real job would allow, it is still a very good experience for the students. Many teens are hit hard when they leave school and enter into the workforce because school is much easier than a job. The reason just stated is a great example of why the teacher-designed project would be more beneficial to the students. There are many of people that would agree with these statements above, but there would be opposers that would disagree. It is true that if the projects were student-designed then the students could work around their schedules to work on the project. That does seem very nice for the students, but there are many more advantages to the teacher-designed projects. Keeping the students on task, pushing the students to learn, and preparing students for future year long jobs are all reasons why summer projects should be teacher-designed. The projects that students receive now should be teacher-designed. This would make them much better for the students in so many great ways."

The article state that, "" The process beings when the computer contructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles"". Dr. Paul Eckman was the creater of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). What methods do they use to make this happen and possbile? Dr. Eckman classified the six basics motions-happiness,surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness but he associated each characteristics with the movements of the facial muscles. For example, "" your frontails pairs lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're surprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger"". According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions,but also may even help to produce them.

681,0,"Over the last two decades, cell phones have become very popular. Today, almost everyone has a cell phone, especially if they are old enough to drive. Cell phone use while driving has become a big controversy over the last few years and many people have faced the consequences of texting, calling, or searching their cell phones while operating a vehicle. With that being said, there are several reasons why people should not use their phones while driving. These reasons can be classified into a couple of different categories, including safety and legal reasons. The first reason to not use a cell phone while driving is that it can result in injury or death for the driver or someone else. This could pose a safety hazard and would therefore fall under the safety category. Statistically, there are 1.6 million car crashes that are caused by texting and driving each year. Almost 390,000 injuries each year from accidents involve a cell phone or other device. Also, 1 out of every 4 car accidents are caused by texting and driving in the U.S. Therefore, there is always a risk that an accident will happen as a result of cell phone use and could harm anyone involved in the accident. The second reason to not use a cell phone while driving is that it can result in property damage for the driver or someone else, which could pose a safety hazard but could also result in someone pressing charges. Therefore, this could be classified under the safety category and the legal category. As mentioned above, crashes due to cell phone use while driving are very common in the United States. It can cause damage to other vehicles, houses, and or company buildings. Whatever your insurance doesn't cover you have to pay out of pocket and these damages can get really expensive. Any insurance claim could also cause your monthly payments to go up. The last reason to not use a cell phone while driving is that it is against the law in many states such as Georgia, which would fall under the legal category. On July 1, 2018, Georgia passed a Hands-Free law that basically says that anyone driving a motor vehicle on a highway in Georgia is not allowed to hold a phone with any part of their bodies. A first-time offense for using a cell phone and driving is $50, the second is $100, and the third is $150. Each offense after the third one is also $150 each. Every offense is a misdemeanor that would go on your permanent record. There are multiple reasons why you should not use your phone while driving. This distracted driving can lead to car wrecks that could cause harm to you, to someone in your car, or to anyone else involved in the accident. An accident could also cause damage to your car, to someone else's car, or to homes, buildings, and other property damage. It is also illegal in many other states so if you are caught you could be fined up to $150 and it would go on your permanent record. Because of these potential safety hazards and legal issues, it is best to not use a cell phone while driving a vehicle."
3292,0,"Schools give many projects and homework assignments to assure the student knows the information, and it also gives them a chance to learn something new. Schools give projects during spring break, winter break, and even our longest break during the summer. Many of these projects are made or designed by a teacher, while some have a basic outline and are mostly designed by the students. Projects should be designed mostly by the students, and many agree with this statement as well. Summer break projects should be mostly designed by the student because this makes the students strengths and weaknesses easier to indicate. This allows the teacher to understand what his/her students need help with. They can guide the student on how to perfect their strengths and improve on their weaknesses. An example of this would be if a student is bad at giving examples in essays. If the student is given an essay on ""What was the most impactful battle of WWII"", they have many examples to choose from and many reasons those examples would be chosen. But if the student is given an essay on ""Why should video cameras be used"", their mediocre examples will be easier to notice as not as many facts back up the opinions on if cameras should be used or not. Some may say since student-designed essays show the students flaws, their flaws could cause them to get a poor grade. While this is true in some cases, it is better the student's teacher see his/her mistakes now and help them improve on them, rather than before the big test. Although this is indeed one, there are many more examples of why summer projects should be student-designed. Summer break projects should be mostly designed by the student because this allows more creative freedom and ideas on the essay/project. A student has free range to think of new ideas if they are not put on a metaphorical leash by the teacher. They can explore new ideas which in turn could make their essay much better and even teach the teacher something they never knew before. A satisfactory example of this would be if the teacher assigned an essay where the student could write about whatever they want, but they had to relate it to racism. The student could write about slavery, the Civil Rights Movement, Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, and they could even write about hip hop. But if the teacher tells the student to write an essay about "" Why we read books"" or "" Why we eat food"" the students will all have similar responses. They will say something along the lines of "" We read books for the knowledge and information they give us"" or "" We eat food because food is a necessity our body needs to function properly"". These essays/projects are very linear and do not bring anything creative to the table. A few may say that allowing full creative freedom on essays will cause students to drift away from the central idea of the essay and dive into personal opinion. Of course it is inevitable this will happen to some, good writers will know to not do this and will stay on the topic of their essay, while the writers who went astray will get some help from their teachers on how to improve that. Summer break projects should be mostly designed by students because this will encourage the student to do better on their essays/projects. Allowing freedom on a project allows the students to try as hard as they possibly can, while if they were given a project on something that disinterests them, they will only do what is required. If a student that is a fan of Lil Uzi Vert(rapper) is given a project on "" The Evolution of Classical Music"", they are only going to do the minimum requirements of that project, while if they are given a project on Effect of Old Rap on New Hip Hop"", they will be more interested as it relates to something they hold dear. Some people may say that the students should already be encouraged to do the project since it is an important grade at the beginning of your school year, which is true, but some students need to be motivated in order to want to go the extra mile, and doing a project on one of your favorite artists is the right motivation. Summer break projects seem to have a negative vibe around them. Not many want to do them, and some think we shouldn't have them, but if we are going to have to do a project over the summer it should be about something e like or something we hold dear. Our families, our friends, our hobbies, our music taste, etc. Doing summer break projects on things that relates to us encourages us to do better, shows our flaws, and gives us freedom to run wild."

In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars and these cars are going to change the world with positivities. Google had cars ""driven more than half a million miles without a crash,"" according to pragraph 2. With Driverless Cars, people could multitask, relax, and there will be more safety. First of all, people could be multitasking when use atonomous cars. For example, a new employee was late to work. He didn't have time to get dressed. He took his clothing and went toward the car. That is when driverless cars come in handy. He could dressed up in the car and the car would just be driving itself. He could also read, take a nap, and eat. Secondly, there will be more safety. According to paragraph 5, these driverless cars ""apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone."" In paragraph 7, it talked about how they can also handle the speeds up to 25 mph. The car will notify the driver when it is required by flashing lights and other heads-up displays. Also, many people around the world are using cars nowadays. By using driverless cars, humans could save money. Who wouldn't want that? In paragraph 1, Sergey Brin, Google cofounder, says that these cars would use lesser fuel than today's taxis and offer more flexibility than a bus. This is what everyone has been waiting for. The people who use this kind of car wouldn't regret this. In conclusion, driverless cars will be bringing benefits to the people. These cars will change the world and the daily lives of humans. The reason is that, there will be less accidents and people wouldn't be injured very often. These cars could control the car than a human driver could. It could also saves money.

20403,0,"Dear Senator, I agree with Bob Dole about abolishing the Electoral College. The Electoral College is unfair to the voters. It's called the diaster factor for a reason. The American people should be able to vote for who they want. It states that when a person votes you are clearly voting for a slate of electors not the president himself. The Winner-take-all system in each state, candidiates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning,focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. It is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. Residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised- to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president. Should residents of another region feel like their votes do not count? No, they shouldn't each vote should be counted in order for the president to get into The White House. The president is their president as well as mine and yours and they shouldn't have to feel as if he wasn't and wouldn't want to know what their interest were. They should be treated equally. In the big states the Electoral College it restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. Other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campain than a small one does.. Every state should have the same amount of attention, not be treated differently."
3172,0,"Most students try their best to avoid learning over the summer. As a result, they forget the knowledge they learned in the prior school year and aren't prepared for the upcoming school year. To get used to learning again, student's brains need to be refreshed and stimulated in the beginning of every school year. As an attempt to solve this problem, teachers assign summer projects. Students, often times, despise these projects because they are boring and stressful. However, these projects are neccessary because they ensure students don't forget about school. To make the projects more enjoyable for students, they should design the projects instead of teachers. Student-designed projects would be better because they focus on their interests, have higher quality, and be less stressful. In most cases, students don't find school work interesting because the topics aren't based around things students care about. Students get tired of learning about the same meaningless things that have no value in their lives. The things they are taught in school can't be applied to the real world and are based around a broken system that focuses on grades and memorization, not learing. Student-designed projects would focus on their interests. Students would actually want to learn compared to falling asleep in their history class listening to something that happened 900 years ago. Students could assign themselves a project based on a book they enjoy or a phenonom they find mysterious. Students would work and have fun doing it. The projects would still be educational and purposeful, but students wouldn't feel forced to do it. It is a known fact that if people love what they do, they will put more effort into it. When people don't enjoy their work, they don't care as much and don't try as hard. This concept can be applied to student-designed projects. For once, students would be excited to work and learn because they get the chance to do something their passionate about. Students would put more effort into their projects. As a result, their quality of work and overall project would be much better compared to if they had to work on a teacher-designed project. They would get higher grades and teachers would be impressed with their work. School is extremely stressful for students throughout the school year. The workload is intense and hard to manage. Teachers give difficult test and assign massive piles of homework that students have to complete for typically seven classes. Students feel pressure to attain good grades. This can lead to terrible sleep patterns, mental breakdowns, and anxiety attacks. Outside factors can also add to their stress. Students have to deal with their social and family problems, which can be emotionally traumatizing. Students also partake in clubs and sports or have jobs that just add to their workload. Summer is a much needed break for students because they can escape from the stress that the school year brings. On their break, the last thing students want is another stressful project. Student-designed projects would reduce their stress significantly. They wouldn't feel as much pressure to meet their teachers standards and would wouldn't procrastinate as much. Student-designed projects would encourage learning for students without incorporating the factor of stress that comes along with school work. Some might say that student-designed projects wouldn't focus on real topics or be taken seriously by the students. However, teachers could approve the designs to make sure they are educational. Teachers can also grade the projects like teacher-designed projects to make sure students don't blow the project off. Students will enjoy these projects much more because they can have fun with it. These projects will also help them learn over the summer break and prepare them for the school year. Student-designed projects are much better than teacher-designed projects because they focus on the students interests, increase their quality of work, and take away stress. Student-designed summer break projects should be implemented into more school systems around America."
17280,0,"- In the passage ""Driverless Cars are Coming,"" explains how Google cofounder Sergey Brin invented driverless cars for the future. I feel like the safest way to get around is cars with drivers in control. I say that because the passege says 'the car will send an alert to the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents,' but what roadblocks lie ahead for the autonomous car? - Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe and I understand that but would we all be safe with a driverless car? I say no because if there's no driver there's no control and if this world didn't have contol it would be nothing but madness and we don't need that. These ""driverless cars'' aren't safe that's why they're illegal to even test in California, Nevada, Florida, and the district of Columbia. Manufactures believe that more states will follow as soon as the cars are proved more reliably safe.- What if the car gets into an accident and you or someone else is injured? Would you think it's you fault or the manufacturer's fault? -Automakers are still continuing their work on the ''assumption'' that the problems ahead will be solved, but there shouldn't be no problems because they keep testing them right and said the cars can drive more than half a million miles without a crash so why should there be a problem? - The passage also says ""new laws would have to be passed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident."" Laws are getting passed everyday like Gay marrage and legallizing marijuana but driverless cars are simply not safe at all and that is my final opinion. Even though the last paragraph of the passage says ""Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time."" I feel like that 90 percent is the percentage of danger the car will cause and the other 10 percent is the safest because the driver is in control. This is why I feel driverless cas shouldn't be released in the future."
20022,0,"We should abolish the Electoral College and change the election to popular vote for the president of the United States. The Electoral College is corupt compared to popular vote. They're more cons than pros about the Electoral College. A lot of people agree that we should change our voting to popular vote. Electoral College voting should not be the way we vote for something so important. The Electoral College System is wrong. In source two, Bradford Plumer said that ""under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president"". You have no clue who your voting in with the Electoral College system. Plumer also said ""they can be anyone not holding public office"" and ""electors could always defy the will of the people"". Do you really want someone who you dont know and can't trust to be an elector? If you wanted someone like that you might as well let a child do the job. In source one the Office of the Federal Register said ""when you vote for your canadidate you are actually voting for your candidates elector's"". More than one source said that you vote in electors when voting for a your candidate. The Electoral College system is said to be unfair to voters in source two. The Electoral College system has a ""winner-take-all"" system. Which means if a Democrat candidate wins they will have Democrat electors and if a Republican wins the will have Republican electors. In source one the Office of the Federal Register also said that the ""winner-take-all"" system ""awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate"". This is not fair to the voters or the United States. If a tie happened it would be even more unfair to voters. if a tie did happen the House of Representatives would break it. In source two Plumer said ""the House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. If the voting doesnt even show your will why vote? Plumer also said in source two that ""the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational"". I agree with plumer, the Electaral College needs to go. Even though the Electoral College has a lot more cons than pros they have some pros. In source three Posner give you the ""five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"". Posner said the first reason was ""certainty of outcome"". The second reason is ""the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal"". the third and fourth reason is ""swing states"" and ""big states"". the fifth reason is the Electoral College system can ""avoid run-off elections"". These are all pros of keeping the Electroral College, but are they really worth it? Would you rather have these pros compared to having fairness? We should abolish the Electoral College and change the election to popular vote for the president of the United States. Popular voting is alot better for everyone. The pros of popular voting excedes the pros of the Electoral College. Popular voting gives everyone a fair chance and doesnt just have a ""winner-take-all"" system. it actually gives both political parties a chance. I agree with source two when it said ""Abolish the Electoral College!"". Source two was right we need to put an end to the Electoral College system!"
7702,0,"Not everyone likes to be in extracurricular activities or have or have to stay after school. Sometimes it can be tiring and it can put a lot of stress on you. That can really be hard on you as a kid. But I am here to tell you why we shouldn't have to be in extracurricular activities. There are many reasons why we shouldn't have to be in extracurricular activities. One would be that other kids might have things they have to do after school like dance practice or softball practice etc. so that would make it hard for them to be at both or have a miss one of their practices. Two maybe some students just don't want to do extra stuff for school maybe after a long day at school they just wanna go home and relax or watch TV. Another one could be that they just don't find it appealing and they can start lacking in it and not helping out in anyway. That is just coming off of personal experience. Some other ones would be that some students will do it just to act up in that class. I have seen people that has caused so much harm to a class or a sport because someone made them do it and they really don't want to be there. If I was the teacher personally I wouldn't want a student on my team or in my class that it there just to act up. Next, some kids will do it because their friends are doing it. You all want kids that are going to do it because they want to not because they see their friends doing it. Others might be that they could be doing just to waste your time. Personally if I want to do something I'm gonna do it but I'm not gonna waste your time but other kids don't ever think about that. Another one would be that they might not be doing it for the right reason. Most people that I have seen have got into something just to say that they are in not because they want to help they, just want to make their self look good and thats not OK. We can't always force someone to do something they dont want to do. I honestly disagree with this decision because there could be a kid or a select group of kids that like to start fights or want to harm other students. I wouldn't want to work in that type of environment where I'm scared to even ask a question. You all should let the students decide for themselves what they want to do. If you don't all the stuff that I told you might happen it might actually happen. You have to give us the chance to decide what we want to do in life."
12840,0,"In 1976 a strange humanlike face was found on Mars by NASA's Viking 1. A giant face almost two miles long was thought to be created by aliens. But NASA scientists thought differently. I believe that the face is a natural ladform as well as NASA. Becsause the NASA scientists proved it was a mesa and that they had no reason to cover up alien life. The face was found in one of the regions of Mars called Cydonia. Scientists were in shock at first, but they stated that it was a Martian mesa even though a face like structure was seen in the pictures. A couple days afterward the formation was unveiled for the public to see and they went insane over the images. The conspiracy theroies piled up as some stated that the pictures were perfect evidence of life on Mars. NASA's budget only wished that there was actual life on Mars but knew all to well there was no life on Mars. Only a handful of NASA scientists thought of this as an alien artifact, but getting more pictures of it was a top priority for NASA. On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Mars Orbiter Camera team took a picture ten times sharper than the original photos. Thousands of web surfers were waiting for the image to appear on a JPL web site. There wasn't an alien monument. But all it did was reveal a natural landform. I was thrillled when I read this becuase it proved my hypothesis correct. But there were still some people who werent satisfied by the images. Some people claimed that there was a haze that kept the alien markings hidden. On April 8, 2001 on a cloudless summer day in Cydonia the Mars Global Surveyor got close enough for a second look. Using the cameras highest resolution it took a picture of the face. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASAs Mars Exploration Program stated As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, also he said So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were! The face on Mars had captivated people's imagination for years. Wheather in a movie, books, magazines, or even in the gossip magazines. Aleins creating face just doesnt seem logical enough for NASA scientists or for me. Throughout this writing I've stated multiple facts and come to the conclusion that the face on Mars was just a natural landform, and not a alien made monument. I hope that you also will come to the same conclusion yourself."
4352,0,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break, and are either designed by their teacher, or designed by the students. In my opinion, these projects should be designed by the teacher. I believe this because teachers are more likely to have more knowledge about the next level of learning than the students would know, and therefore, would be able to put better information that would most likely to be more effective for the student as they move on. Also, the teacher would know better about how much work each individual student needs to have and what their limits are as well. Students could also reach out to their teachers in case the students summer plans would get in the way of their summer project, allowing teachers to know how much the amount of work should be given out to the students so they can both work, and get some r and r. Finally, teacher-designed projects would be most likely be very similar to each other and would be easier to grade for the next teacher, and allow students to recieve assistance from other students in case their teacher is not available for help. The first reason why summer assignments should be designed by the teacher is that the teacher usually knows more about the upcoming classes the student will have to take when the summer is over and school starts up again than the student would. The teacher would be able to select the topics for the summer assignment the students would need to know in order to get ready and be prepared for the next grade. In case they do not know what to do, most students would have to take time out of their day to find out about what they will be learning about in the next school year if they are designing the summer project by themselves, and that time could have been easily used to be working on their summer assignment. Another reason why summer assignments should be designed by the teacher is that the teacher would be able to know what each individual student can and cannot do, and will be able to give out the most appropriate amount of work needed for each student so the student can succeed. Since every individual is different and learns at different speeds and learns things differently, this will allow students to be able to learn incredibly well and be prepared at their own pace. In case summer plans would get in the way of the students summer projects, they should be able to get in touch with their teacher and learn what they could do to get the project done on time. This could involve less work or maybe a different assignment than what they first received to fit what the students summer plans will be. This allows for students to get a healthy amount of work in the summer while getting rest and doing summer activities. My final reason on why teacher-designed summer projects would be better than if the students designed them, is that teacher assigned projects could be similar to each student and would be less difficult to grade. Also, it would allow students to recieve help from other students that would help them succeed. This concludes my essay whether summer projects would be better if they were designed by students, or made by the teachers, I believe that if teachers designed them, it would allow a more fitting learning experience, better information on what students should know, and the amount of work that is needed for each student."

16522,0,"Dear TEACHER_NAME, I understand that you wish to change our school policy regarding requirements for sports. Now I know that we have many wonderful students who are tremendous at their sport and they made a commitment to have a C average or above. Raising the requirements to a B average would make them try harder, but some would give up because they think its too hard. Having smart students who participate in sports would be quite interesting but what about our star Football players, Basketball players, or Cheerleaders who have a C average and have to give up something they love. Now I know I wouldn't want to give up my sport because of my grades, and i know you love watching our teams win. And if every athlete who have a C average quit their sport then we would have very few athletes in our school and a less likely chance of winning our games and that wouldn't be first-rate now would it? Our students have fair grades but I do admit they could be better, I believe we should recommend B averages instead of enforcing a ""law"" about them. Other than sports there are the OTHER_NAME, Beta Club, and Art Club. If we raised the requirements for the grade average then some students wouldn't be able to participate in these clubs, and it would be a pity if we had to lose very important members of our clubs. Why raise the Grade average when it is fine the way it is? I think that we should leave it the way it is now and keep our sports teams, academic teams, and school clubs the way they're supposed to be with every member remaining on that specific group, club, team, or whatever you wish to call it."
3696,0,"Summer is like a brainwash. Students seem to forget everything they learned in school that year over the summer. To try and combat this, many teachers assign summer projects so the students don't fall behind on any of their learning. Students are often upset by this, wanting their summer to be fun and stress free. Teacher designed projects are often long and tedious making them boring to do. The summer projects should be student-designed. Having the projects be student-designed allows for a greater range of creativity, more control over how the project is completed, and creates a better mindset for disgruntled students. Allowing for summer projects to be student designed makes for a greater range of creativity. A greater range of creativity would encite students to finish their projects faster if they were given a wider range of mediums to work with instead of just paper and pencil, or a computer program. Even when it's not over the summer, being assigned a project where I can make a poster or create a diorama instead of writing a paper is already much more exciting to me because I'm given a bunch of different mediums to work with. I personally prefer creating something big and artsy to sitting down and churning out a paper within a set time frame. The process of creating something huge feel much more satisfying because I can visibly see when I am done. Completing a paper still has a feeling of satisfaction but the overall feeling is dulled because no creativity was released. A greater range of creativity also allows for a much more interesting presentation. A differentation of styles in projects makes the overall project much more interesting and increases the chances of students paying attention for longer during those presentations. Completion of the project is thought to be most important. Allowing students to control how the project is completed is much more student oriented. A student oriented project should be more fun and less stressful as to not add anything more on top of an already heavy workload. Letting students decide how the project is presented and what the rubric should entail makes the students not only happier, but less stressed as a result. If the students can control what they want to do in the project or how the final product should be, it could help immensely with the overall students happiness and create a stronger student community. The mindset for summer is just fun, fun, fun. Adding a summer project dampens that mindset. It becomes a burden for students to deal with. No one wants to do schoolwork over the summer, summer is the time for fun! Allowing students to create a student designed project would create an overall better mindset towards how summer project are viewed. I know that I don't want to do school work over the summer. Giant math packets, books to read, papers to write, it's all so tedious and I always end up pushing it off til August, where I'm then rushing to get it all done in time for the start of school. If I were to be given a project that I could control, it would already seem so much better because I would be in full control over what I did for the project or how I approached a problem I encountered with it. It's important to keep a healthy mindset in school so you don't burn yourself out. Summer is seen as a time to destress and have fun and creating a better mindset towards student project by making them student designed is extremely crucial to that. When I think of school projects, I think of teachers handing them out at the end of a quarter or towards the end of school to be completed over the summer. Projects are a way to either boost or bring down your grade, depending on how you do. Because of that effect on grades, important projects tend to stress students out. When students are given more control over a project it immediately takes stress off the student because they automatically control how their project is made and presented. Teacher designed projects are made to showcase how well teachers teach their students. If more students get a higher grade on a project, the credibility of that teacher goes up. They are viewed as a better teacher overall. While teacher designed projects might have more academic results, having projects be student-designed creates a wider range of creativity, control over how the project is executed, and makes a more postive mindset for students."
9586,0,"Humans have taken extreme measures to achieve their goal of landing on the moon. At the time, many people did not believe that it was ever going to be possible. Today, many astronaut have successfully landed on the moon. The challenge of exploring Venus is another one of these cases that some humans believe is possible, but others do not. The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" explains how scientists today strive to meet this challenge and take it on, even after knowing the chaotic conditions of Venus, in order gain insight on the planet as well as to stifle their own curiosity. The ""Evening Star"", or the planet Venus has extremely dangerous surface and atmospheric conditions for humans to explore, but in many ways has similar features to Earth as well. One of the main reasons humans would not be able to survive a trip to Venus's surface without the proper equipment is because the average surface temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Because of this, Venus has the hottest surface temperature out of all of the other planets. Another aspect of the dangerous conditions of Venus's surface is that it has frequently-errupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and lightning strikes. Thes conditions would be dangerous for humans if they were on the surface for to long. These are some of the reasons why past attempts of exploration were unsuccessful. Even though Venus has many dangerous conditions on the surface, there are also many landforms that make it comparable to Earth. Some of these are a scatter of valleys, mountains, and craters. Scientists also believe that Venus used to be covered with vast oceans and potentially could have supported various forms of life. Even though there are so many components, surface conditions are not the only chaotic feature of the ""Evening Star"". The atmosphere of Venus is also extremely dangerous for humans to surpass. The clouds are filled with corrosive sulfuric acid and the atmosphere is dense with 97% carbon dioxide. The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what is experienced on Earth. These extreme conditions make it far too dangerous for human to explore. To resolve this issue, scientists at NASA today have begun to innovate ideas to find a way to successfully send humans to observe the features of Venus. One of the approaches NASA is taking to the problem is to simulate Venus's surface conditions in order to test different engineered materials to see how well they withstand the constant heat and pressure. Another approach that the scientists have researched is flying a ""blimp-like vehicle"" about 30 miles about the surface of Venus to avoid having to land on the scorching surface. This method had many plusses because the ""solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed Earth levels"". Just like there are many plusses that come this idea, there are also a few negatives. Because flying higher than 30 miles above the surface is one of the only options in getting close enought to observe, the distance will cause ""limited insight on ground conditions"". The thick atmosphere would prevent photography to be clear and decipherable. Another negative is that the scientists have no way to collect any samples from the surface for evidence. Flying above the atmosphere would get the astronauts close, but it would be ineffective. Each day, scientist work hard to come up with new materials and ideas to achieve their goal to successsfully explore Venus. Even though there are many dangers because of the harsh atmospheric and surface conditions, scientists and astronauts work towards this goal because they are determined and believe it is possible to overcome these obstacles to get to what they've worked hard for."

He wants to take all AP classes because he thinks it will help when he applies for colleges in the future. Generic_Name asks, ""Generic_Name, do you think I should take all AP classes?"" ""Yes! They're super easy and fun,"" Generic_Name exclaims. Generic_Name doesn't know a lot about AP classes, he doesn't have any older siblings and he hasn't talked to his teachers about his schedule yet. Generic_Name responds, ""Wow! Thanks for the advice, I'm definitely going to take them."" The next morning he drops his schedule off at the guidance office. Generic_Name overhears Ms. Generic_Name, the guidance counselor, talking to a student in her office. ""Make sure to only take the classes you can handle. AP classes are extremely challenging and you should only take about 2 or 3,"" Ms. Generic_Name explains. Generic_Name's heart drops to his feet, he had no idea how hard the classes were! Suddenly he gets a rush of rage and storms to Generic_Name's locker. Generic_Name yells, ""Why would you tell me the classes are easy? Ms. Generic_Name was talking about how hard they are and I already turned in my schedule!"" ""I'm sorry, I had no idea! I don't know a lot about high school and I thought they would be easy because I have all A's,"" Generic_Name says. Generic_Name responds, ""Dang, I should've asked more people about it."" When people ask for advice, they should talk to more than one person and seek multiple opinions because different people have different amounts of knowledge on topics, people have different points of view, and people have different experiences. When people ask for advice they should talk to more than one person because people have different amounts of knowledge. For example, if one person is an aspiring fashion designer and another is just an ordinary teenager, you would want to ask them both for their opinions on your outfit because they have different amounts of knowledge on fashion. Most people have a certain topic, hobby, or sport that they know a lot about, so asking multiple people for their opinions can help you make the right decision because you might find someone that has a lot of knowledge on the topic you're asking about. Another example is if someone was asking me what instrument they should choose to play, I could give them a lot of information because I play an instrument, but if they asked someone who has no knowledge on music and doesn't play an instrument they wouldn't get a lot of information. You might not know your friends have a lot of knowledge on a topic until you ask them. Simply asking multiple people for their opinions can spark a conversation in which you learn a lot about the topic. When people ask for advice they should talk to more than one person because people have different points of view. For example, if you're asking people for advice about what you should do when you have a problem with your friend, some people might tell you to go to a counselor and work it out, and some people might just tell you to talk to the person about it. When you ask different people for their opinions you can see how many people have the same opinion on a topic and how many people disagree with it. If everybody you ask about a topic has a certain opinion, but only one person disagrees, you wouldn't just go with the one person disagreeing. If you only ask that one person about the topic then you could've made the wrong choice, but if you ask multiple people for their points of view you can make the right choice and get more insight. Furthermore, when a lot of people have the same opinion on something, it is most likely the right choice. When people ask for advice they should talk to more than one person because people have different experiences. People have different experiences and their experiences can cause them to have more wisdom than others. For example, if you ask people on advice about where you should travel, you might find people who have a lot of experience traveling and they can give you their opinions and share their wisdom. If you only asked one person and that person has never even left the country, then you aren't getting a wise, reliable opinion. Another example is if you're asking an adult or a professional about the topic then they are clearly more wise because they are either specialized in that field or simply have lived longer and have more experiences in general. People who have a lot of wisdom are responsible and reliable. They'll think about the outcome of your decision and all the possible negatives, this makes them really good people to ask for advice and they'll probably choose the best option for you. Generic_Name goes to Ms. Generic_Name's office to ask her if he could take his schedule paper back. She gives him the paper back and asks him if he needs any advice. Generic_Name says, ""Yes actually, I was wondering if you could help me decide if I should take a lot of AP classes or not."" ""Of course! You should only take AP classes for the classes you're really interested in and have a B+ or higher,"" Ms. Generic_Name explains. ""Oh, that makes sense, I think I'm going to take AP bio, AP geometry, and AP world history because those are my favorite classes and I have a good grade in all of them,"" Generic_Name says. Ms. Generic_Name replies, ""Now that sounds like a way better option than what you chose before."" Generic_Name chuckles. He is dismissed to go back to lunch and he asks Generic_Name for his opinion too. Generic_Name asks, ""Do you think I should take AP bio, AP geometry, and AP world history?"" ""Not world history, my older brothers both took that class and they said its really hard and you get a ton of homework every day,"" Generic_Name explains. Generic_Name responds, ""Oh, okay. Thank you, I would've had no idea if I didn't ask you!"" Now Generic_Name has a lot more information.

The author give a few reasons why it would be worth to study Venus. The author brings up how we would use this experience in other ways. The author brought up how Venus was once like Earth and how it had inhabinants. The author brings up ways that we could explore venus. The author brings up how it the successful and unsuccessful knowledge would help us in other situations. We could use this experience for mars which would seem a lot easier to tackle if we can successfully land on venus and study that planet. We could use the information on how they built the shuttle for submarines, So we could go deeper and not have to worry about the hull being damaged as easily. The information we get on how to properly land on venus would make all of space travel a little easier. The piece states that Venus could have been just like Earth once. "" Long ago, Venus was probaly covered largely with oceans and coudl have supported variuos forms of life, just like Earth."" That exclamation shows that it's possible that there can be life out there that not from earth. The are also features that are also on earth, like mountains, crater, and valleys. What we could learn for why that ecosystem failed could help us in the future. The author tells us that people are thinking of ways explore Venus. One idea is that we float in a blimp like craft above the hostile conditions. We still couldn't get the the ground without some challenges but it is a start. The author also brings up how we could bring computers that are made of gears and levers that would work better in harder conditions. Venus is possible to explore we just have to look at it in a certian angle. We have ideas of what to do but we either don't have the means or can't figure out how to do it. We could float above the surface. We could use a more sturdy time of mechanical computer. The information we learn for landing on Venus and from Venus itself could help us in so many ways."
25427,0,I believe asking more than one person for advice is really important and here is why. When people ask for advice they usually want multiple responses or different point of views to get the best advice. If someone wants to know how to get on a sports team they would ask all of their friends that play sports for advice. Some people also ask for advice when they want to get better grades in school. Asking more than one person for advice is a way better then only asking one. When people ask for advice they want to here what people think is the best for them at that certain point in time. People dont ask only one person for advice they usually ask more than one. They do that because they want what most people think is better for them. If you only ask one person for advice then that person might not give the best advice. But if you ask more than one person there are so many different point of views that you get different advice and better advice for any problems your having. If you are trying to play a sport or get on a team then you would probably ask your friends or a coach for advice. Because they have knowledge about that sport and how to get better at it. They would give you advice on how to get on the team. They could give you advice on how to get better endurance or get stronger for that sport. When it comes to sports there are a lot of different people who you can ask and who give different type of advice. If you're not doing how you want in school and you have bad grades there are so many people you can ask for advice. You can ask the teachers for advice on how to do the things your not too good at. Some teachers might tell you to go to after school tutoring if you need help. Asking your friends that have really good grades for advice is a great idea. They can teach you the things they do to get good grades. Asking your parents for advice in school is also a good idea because they have already made it through school so they can tell you what they did to pass. So ask as many people ask you can for advice when you need it. Because you need to know how to do things in school and sports. So asking as many people for advice as you can is really important.
539,0,"Phones & Driving The use of cellular phones has spread like wildfire in the last ten years. It has become a part of everyday life for many American citizens, and a good number of people depend on them to carry out daily operations. Unfortunately, many of these daily operations occur while the individual is driving. As a result, many accidents have taken place in the last ten years due to the use of cellular phones while on the road. This leads me to believe that if people can't concentrate on the road while talking on a cell phone, they shouldn't talk at all while driving. Rather than restricting access, the goal should be to provide in-vehicle information systems and safer means of using your cellular phone while driving. I understand that restricting cell phone usage while driving altogether isn't the best means for solving the problem. I do, however, believe that more safety precautions need to be taken for individuals who will be talking on their phones while driving. Phones are being created by Erricson, Motorolla, and Nokia today in which offer a hands-free cell phone so that you can keep both hands on the wheel while driving and talking. Some of these come in the form of headsets and give the user a voice-activated sequence, which allows you to talk into the speaker, and the number will instantly be dialed. Already this has eliminated the chance of your hands being off the wheel and having to do the act of dialing the phone. Both which allow you to keep your hands on the wheel and eyes on the road. Even hands-free devices that allow us to talk on the phone while driving with both hands on the wheel are still a hazard. Studies have shown that while talking to someone on the phone your brain is putting a lot of its energy into the conversation. This means that less of your brain is focused on driving the car. Yes, that could also mean a conversation with someone in the car is dangerous but you add in bad reception, how uncomfortable the hands-free earpieces are to wear and the annoyance of static or wind and you have a worse distraction. Whatever it is can almost always wait until you get where you are going. If it can't wait, you can always stop to look. Cell phone use should be banned for the safety of everyone on the roads. It may not be as convenient, but we won't lose nearly as many teenage lives to Tweets or texts if they know their license could be taken if they do look."
22233,0,"dI have heard that you have been wanting to change the school policy about cell phones so i just wanted to give you some ideas. In my opinion, i think policy 1 is not a good idea. If students can use phones during lunch periods and other free times they have, they might be taking out there phones in class and calling/texting there friend during class time. A student could be helping another student out during a test through texting,so i wouldn't recommend policy number 1. Policy number 2 has a good side and a bad side to it. The good side to policy number 2 is that they will not be able to communicate to other students during class time. But the bad side of policy number 2 is that they would not be able to call there parents after school to pick them up. So i recommend a policy number 3, which is: students should not be aloud to have phones out during school hours, they should be turned off, but they may take it out after school if they need to call someone. That way they will not be calling/texting any one during class, and if they are caught with the phone on, they should get it taken away until the end of the day. Then after school they will be able to call someone. Thank you for reading my letter, i hope you take my recommendation of policy number 3. sincerely, Students of your school"
9120,0,"In this passage the author claims many ways and benefits of visiting and exploring our sister planet venus. He claims that venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density, size and it is the closest to Earth in distence. He also claims that even thogh it will be dangerous and difficult to explore venus there are already many scientist trying to figure out ways to make it safe and less of a risk. The authors claims in this passage does support the idea of studying venus despite the dangers. Through out this passage the author describes how simular venus is to earth. In Paragraph 4 he states that venus may have once been just like Earth a long time ago. The author states that many Astronomers beleive that Venus could have once been covered up by large oceans and could have supported various life forms. Venus has many features that Earth also has. Venus has features like valleys, mountains, and craters like earth. The author claims that venus can be our nearest option to visit when space exploration is possible. It would be better to visit a place that could have once been just like Earth that is close. The author claims that many scientist are already finding and testing new and safe ways to get close enough to Venus to explore it. In Paragraph 5 the author states that NASA has a possible solution to the hot temerpatures of Venus. NASA would make it so scientist would be able to float above Venus from a distence. The temperatures would still be around 170 degreed Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be like the sea level on Earth. They would not be the easiest conditions to work in, but a human would be able to survive in these conditions. In conclusion, the authors claims that the idea of studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers is a good idea. The author backs his claim up with many facts such as Venuses simularites to Earth. The authors claims do support his ideas thoughout the passage."
13,0,"Operating a motor vehicle while on your cell phone Being on your device and driving could be an overly dangerous choice in life. Many people around the world are injured by this situation every day. It could lead to accidents and altercations. In addition it would even cost you your licences. The most detrimental outcome is death. There are far more outcomes to operating a motor vehicle while being on a cell phone. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a motor vehicle. One leading cause to motor vehicle accidents is being on your cell phone. It could lead to accidents and altercations. Yourself and the passengers are more at risk to bodily injuries and harm. These bodily injuries and harm can range anywhere from mild to critical condition. In an motor vehicle accident there is more than one involved. There is another person or group of people that could have the exact same conditions than the driver on the cell phone. In an example of an altercations you could be more prone to damaging an building or such. An direct result of an event in place; a fee or very large payment would need to be made. Secondly another consequence could be having your license taken. When you have violated a driving law there will always be an consequence. Rather it being jail time, injuries, or more. Your license will be subjected to suspension. A suspended license defines as you are not able to drive until they are reinstated. The process can take anywhere from a short period of time or even a long period of time. The average time for a suspended license is sixty days. For some people if it is not your first offense they may even take your license for good. Furthermore there is another cause to driving while being on your cell phone. After all the consequences the most detrimental is death. Many people happen to pass away due to a motor vehicle car accident. Not all people pass away at the crash site, some has a condition mild to critical that causes them to die. Around 1.6 million people a year die in motor vehicle accidents. Out of the 1.6 million, 1 out of 4 pass away because drivers are on their cell phone. That includes the driver and the unlucky few that may have been in the car, around, or in another car. Passing away from a motor vehicle accident can be prevented by simply waiting until you have reached a stopping point or your at your destination to pick up your phone. In conclusion, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a motor vehicle. It can cause accidents and altercations, suspension of license, and even death. Prevention is simply not being able to use your phone while operating a motor vehicle. Take a moment to focus on the road. You are able to check your phone when you reach a red light or a complete stop. This is one step closer to its prevention. It will save many lives even your own."

They can also see if the person they have asked have almost the same advice as the other person and do what they told them to do. Also people like talk to more than one person because they want to hear what they think. If they see that the opinions that everyone is giving them are similar, they are most likely to make the choice they have heard. People also make a better choice by doing what they hear the most. This way they know what do to because they heard different opinions from different people. When people also ask for advice they sometimes only talk to only one person. They talk to only one person for advice because they might not trust other people.

4016,0,"Lately summer projects are becoming popular to assure students are learning during the break. There is an ongoing debate over as to whether summer projects should be student-designed or teacher-designed. Some may believe summer projects should be teacher-designed, but this is not true. Although some may disagree, summer projects should be designed by the students. There are a variety of reasons why summer projects should be student-designed. Student-designed projects can reveal an individuals character. For example, an athlete can turn in a sports related project, but it may not be the most organized. This gives the teacher the ability to know what kind of student they are looking forward to teaching. Also, these projects can build a students creativity. Working on summer projects allows students to have more than enough time to brainstorm and come up with something creative. A teacher-designed project can not be as creative, because the rubric has to accommodate every student. Another reason is the projects will increase the students desire to complete the project. With the student creating their own projects it will boost their confidence levels. Also, the teacher will be satisfied because more people will finish the project. There are additional reasons why students should design the summer projects. This will allow the students to bring in a variety of ideas and projects. For instance, one student could have a 3-D project and the other could have a PowerPoint. The students will likely compare and contrast their projects, which will result in students learning new skills for future tasks. Also,this will give the students a challenge. Designing a project is not the easiest task, especially for a child. It also helps the students learn how to persevere and overcome a challenge. Lastly, these projects will teach students how to learn on their own and become independent. Becoming independent and learning on your own are vital skills needed when moving forward in life. For example, in college you do everything on your own, your professor probably will not even know your name. Although some may disagree, summer projects should be student-designed. There are a plethora of reasons to support this notion: it reveals personality and character, builds creativity, and challenges students. In this era we tend to shy away from traditional ways, so why not let the projects be student-designed and change things up a bit."

What I think the you as a principle should do is u should be at least passing five of your classes and should have at least a grade point average of 1.5. At my school in the SCHOOL_NAME is that policy and i am glad too have it but it didn't really matter to me because i was just falling! I was falling because of all my test and everything but i think its just dumb if you have to have at least a B average if that was our school i would at least write a banner saying we should have at least be passing five of our classes and we should be able to have a 1.5 grade point average that's when freedom of speech comes in! So o hope if the principle reads this he will agree with me! It should really be that hard if you listen to me? Don't you wont to see everyone out in the football field, or wrestling mat, or basketball court, or even if you are doing cross country? I would be glad everyone wants to be so active and would change it so you could make their dreams come true!! So i really hope you listen to me because its better if you got people that want to do sports but they cant because at least a B grade point average they could be at home doing drugs, something that will get them into trouble so if u change it too my idea they will be where you could see them, watch them so they don't get sent to detention hall (DH) or anything like that!

18213,0,"_Dangers of the Self-driven Monster_ Do you want your life to depend on the driving of a robotic car? Although there would be reasons as to why these cars are useful, they aren't guaranteed to work. Driverless cars are dangerous because they are prone to malfunction, don't have a way to react quick enough, and is blind to certain things on the road. Everything that is controlled by itself or some sort of robot is prone to malfunction. A car driven by humans is already dangerous enough! If one of these driverless cars was to malfunciton, the one to blame is the manufactorer. With the malfunctioning cars there will be conflict between an individual and the manufactorer. Not only does it cause conflict, but it could cause great damage to our society. Most robotic things are quick, but they are not quick enough to react to something happening in half a second. If a driverless car were setup to react to an incoming car, it would just try to swerve around the car. If the car just swerves and there is another car on the left or right of it, the car would then hit one of those. If the driverless car just breaks to avoid hitting a car in front of it, and the car behind it does not have enough time to react and crashes into him. These cars would cause more damage by being programmed to, quote on quote,""React to an incoming car."" Not only is the car not quick enough to react to an incoming car, it can't see everything around itself. The car would have blindspots, just like humans do. If the car can't see to its right and a car is coming straight for him, Boom! There is another car crash. These cars would basically do everything a human does now. The only thing that this helps with is letting us be even more lazy than what we already are. A self-driven car isn't as safe as people think it to be because they are prone to malfunction, don't have a way to react quick enough, and are blind to certain things on the road. You don't want your life and the life of your family in the wheel of a robotic, self-driven tin-can of death!"
2949,0,"Cars have been a world wide trend for years, but is that trend coming to an end? A new one is coming into play, and it is the car-less suburb and city. The emissions from cars are putting a strain on the health of city air and officials around the world are setting forth the car-less street. In Germany there is a little suburb called Vauban, which is almost completely car free. While ownership of a vehicle is allowed, the only place someone could park it would be a large garage at the edge of the community, which a space costs around $40,000 to buy. As a result 70 percent of the families ther don't own cars. This new trend is predicted to cut down greenhouse gasses in suburbs and cities, for which cars are resposible. ""Automobiles are the linchpin of of suburbs.... And that, experts say, is a huge impedement to current efforts to drastically reduce gas emissions form tailpipes.... Passanger cars are responsible for 12 percent of... gas emissions in Europe... and some 50 percent in... the United States.""(In German Suburbs Life Goes on Without Cars by Elizabeth Rosenthal p. 5) In the Colombian city of Bogota millions of city dwellers hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work on a special day called The Day Without Cars. The citizens agree it is a fruitful endeavor, that lowers pollution, releives stress, and provides a great opportunity to excersize. It even set a trend for two other cities who, for the first time since the event started three years ago, joined in the special day. ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,"" said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asuncion, Paraguay. (Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky p.26) While cars still have their uses, it seems like they are slowly becoming a fading fad. People around the world are embracing a life without cars, and trying to put a dent in the world's pollution. Who knows, if Americans embrace it, there might be an end to the obesity epidemic."
17641,0,"Technology is developing new stuff everyday. Things that are usually an everyday thing are becoming less and less, like the driverless cars, some people despise driving and some people love it. Can you imagine cars that you don't even have to drive? You just tell it where to go and it takes you there on command. I think that's crazy, driverless cars starting out are going to be very dangerous and the road to explore and find new ideas to make them safer is going to be a long one. Some of the cars Google has built have been able to ""drive independently under specific condiotions since 2009."" Google also says that many of their cars have driven miles and miles without a crash, but that's with a driver who's ready for anything to happen and ready to act at any given time. When the driverless cars actually become driverless, I think it'll be a disaster because some people are going to get carried away with it and just not think that their car will never have a malfunction. More people are going to wreck and people are just being plain lazy nowadays. It really doesn't take that much energy to drive a car. Of course you have to stay awake and make sure you're paying attention to the road at all costs, but people are just getting things handed to them. With driverless cars people probably won't have to do drivers ed and their drive times with instructors who are making them better drivers. I think it's just nonsense. On the other hand, there could be a couple positives to this. Some people are born with conditions that can make them not able to drive or do stuff most people do, but with the new driverless cars they'll be able to enjoy the satisfaction of just being able to sit in that drivers seat just like any other person out there. That is if they find a way to make the completely driverless, because if not then they say,""this means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires. One of the most common tragedys that occur are people dying from drunk drivers. Some people make stupid decisions when they're drunk and they might decide to drive home because they think they're well enough too and of course if you're with a bunch of other drunk people they're probably going to encourage it because they don't no any better. With the driverless cars, people making that poor decision won't or might not be affected by it. That's if the scientists find ways to make the cars safer to where you don't have to drive it at all."
896,0,"Today the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis; drivers should be able to use cell phones in a restricted capacity while operating a vehicle. Using a mobile phone while driving can be distracting to most people, especially the younger generations. This makes is very dangerous and there have been horrible accidents and even deaths to happen while texting and driving in particular. While this may be a true fact, there are different ways you can control the use of cell phones while driving. Some states have made it illegal to use a cell phone while driving and others passed laws that enable your use of cell phones restricted like Georgia and the hands free law. Some may argue that the hands free law is not safer than holding a phone while driving. I think that there are more things that can be put in place to assist with the use of cell phones and driving. My argument is that I believe we should be able to use cell phones in a more restricted way which will eventually save lives. We currently live in a world where technology rules us as humans. I say why not allow it to rule us in a safe way. We have self-driving cars; hands free voice to type mechanisms on our devices and even most vehicles that are being made now can read your text for you as you drive. In my opinion, if we use more of these mechanisms properly it would save more lives. Self driving cars will allow us not to be worried about driving on the road; if you insist on texting and driving, why not use the voice to text feature on your phone and finally purchasing a vehicle that will read and type the text to you. While my theories seem far fetched, I believe one day we will be able to live in a world where we will be able to operate cell phones and drive on a daily basis without getting hurt. Technology has brought us this far we should be able to go further if we invent ways to use it in a safe and responsible manner."
8373,0,"The author states that Venus may have been like Earth at one point. Venus may have evidence on the surface about what could have happened to cause it to be inhospitable. Also at some point humans are probably going to run into other challenges like Venus. These claims are some of the reasons the author thinks Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. According to some scientists Venus may have been like Earth at one point. If it really was like Earth before there could be much to learn about it. We could find out what the atmosphere was like before it got too extreme. There may be evidence of life that was once on the planet. In paragraph two the suthor states ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size¨ This is a reason many people believe Venus could have been even more of a twin to Earth than it is now. On the surface there could be the evidence we need to know if there was life forms on Venus. In paragraph five it is said ¨The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.¨ This statement makes it seem that Venus really was like Earth at one point and may have proof if we could land long something on Venus long enough to study the land. In the future humans will continue to explore the solar system and will very likely run into a planet like Venus again. So if humans can learn how to study planets like Venus or land on them then they would have the knowledge needed for the next planet. If we have experince with planets with extreme conditions before finding another planet that also has extreme conditons we could get more information from the plant and at a lot faster rate. In conclusion, the author makes multiple points that support their idea of wanting Venus to be studied. Venus possibly being like Earth at one point and giving us experince of planets like that are very important to the author."
17090,0,"The idea of Driverless cars in the future can be a very controversial topic. Many may say that it is too dangerous, but others argue that there are ways to ensure safety and that these cars are the future of technology. In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" the author presents both sides of the argument. After reading the article, I have come to conclusion that Driverless cars are a positive change in technology and can be used for the better. Google has already invented the driverless car and has been making improvements for years. The car contains sensors on the wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted on the rear view mirror, a GPS reciever, and an intertial motion sensor. All of these things are used in the car to ensure you are provided with a safe ride. Because of Google and their invention of the Driverless car, in the future this could be the public transportation system. These care would use half the fuel that taxis use today and a driverless car offers far more flexibility than a bus. Paragraph 5 states, ""Further improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own"" This quote is showing that all the sensors and cameras that they have inserted into the car make it safe to ride in and make it so that the car is mimicking how it would drive with a person behind the wheel. In conclusion, The google driverless car is an invention that could change the future and they way that we get places. There are both positives and negatives found while testing these cars and making improvements. Overall, with all of the sensors put in the car to ensure safety, google can make it possible to have a safe ride in the car. Once all improvements have been made to the driverless car, it will change the future of transportation."
6705,0,"I believe that when you participate in one or two extracurricular activities,you should be set for a good college in the near future. Activities such as sports,student counseling,and working on the year book. any of that can give you a better G.P.A,and will also give you extra things to do right after school. When colleges see your records from the past years,from middle school,through high school,they want to see one of your biggest achievements,good grades and to see if you have any other hobbies outside of school as a daily routine or to see if you are working really hard as the student. Colleges love to see a person working hard for something important,like an education. They like to see kids who give off effort for what they are doing,they also see and look into kids that can go pro in any sport in the future and people who are advanced in academics and learning. Doing other activities can set a healthier mind set,a healthier body,and can help you set personal goals in life that you wish to achieve, along with a good planner you need when going to college. Also by doing all this you can set a good prime example for a younger sibling of yours. So out of this i'm saying,by doing the extra activities given to you can really help set aside a goal in your life and me reading this i think that the principle should make kids in middle school do extra activities after school to get in the habit of for high school cause its really going to help them with a better future when going for a university."
791,0,"Using a cell phone while driving increases the driver's risk of causing a crash. Drivers are distracted, decreasing the driver's awareness on the road, leading to more car crashes. Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc. Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time. Unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones: while they are driving. As a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones. Using a handheld cell phone while driving is dangerous to the driver themselves for a couple of good reasons. Mobile phone use while driving is common but it is widely considered dangerous due to its potential for causing distracted driving and crashes. Due to the number of crashes that are related to conducting calls on a phone and texting while driving, some jurisdictions have made the use of calling on a phone while driving illegal. Many jurisdictions have enacted laws to ban handheld mobile device use. Nevertheless, many jurisdictions allow use of a hands-free device. Driving while using a hands-free device is not safer than using a handheld phone to conduct calls, as concluded by case-crossover studies, epidemiological, simulation, and meta-analysis. In some cases restrictions are directed only at minors, those who are newly qualified license holders (of any age), or to drivers in school zones. In addition to voice calling, activities such as texting while driving, web browsing, playing video games, or phone use in general can also increase the risk of a crash. In the United States, automobile crashes due to distracted driving are increasing. The leading cause of distracted driving is cell phones. In 2015, six hundred and sixty thousand drivers in the United States were estimated to use cell phones each day, while driving behind the wheel during daylight hours. Cell phone use while driving has become a leading cause of vehicle crashes over the last two decades. Using a cell phone while driving increases the driver's risk of causing a crash. Drivers are distracted, decreasing the driver's awareness on the road, leading to more car crashes. When drivers talk on cell phones the risk of an automobile crash resulting in hospitalization is four times higher than when not talking on a cell phone. Drivers who text when behind the wheel, are twenty-three times more likely to have an automobile crash. One out of every four automobile crashes in the United States are caused by texting while driving. Some states have implemented laws in regards to using cell phones while driving, there is more to be done"

But people complained. And didnt think it was fun or cool to surf or to see cool animals. But luke said that was there opinion i had a great time. I loved it all said Luke. If luke had a nother chance to go back he would. And do it all over again."
3841,0,"There is a plethora of school's around the world that requires students to do a summer project over the course of their summer break. Most of the time, the project is designed by the following teacher. Many would agree with the decision of making the project based off of what the teacher prefers rather than the students because it'll give the student a quick blueprint on what to look for and also what to research for the following project but I believe that the summer projects should be student-designed because it makes the student confident in their work, it'll be personal, and it'll also keep the student interested in the project. Confidence is very important when it comes to a project. According to statistics, 85 percent of students projects are terrible and bland when it's teacher-designed. With that being said, student-designed projects boosts the students confidence and make the student also put effort into the project. Most of the time, when I'm given a teacher-designed project, I don't put enough thought into it because I think i'll already get a bad grade. Even when i do put my all into a teacher-designed project, I still get second thoughts on if i should turn it in. Many students around my school have been complaining that the teacher-designed projects leads them into a deep depression because their aren't sure if the following project would make their grade drop drastically. Most of the time when teachers give out a project they expect the student have prior knowledge on the topic but most of the time, that doesn't be the case. Over the summer, students experience multiple encounters. During that time, students are out enjoying the summer breeze with friends and family. Even if the student didn't do anything during their break, being that the students have a project based on their own opinion, makes the project more personal in a sense. Its gives them many topics to look forward to putting in their project. Lastly, a student-designed project makes the student very interested in their assigned project. Having interest in what you do is also very important because you take your time and put more effort in to your work. Most of the time, when a student is given a teacher-designed project it lacks interest. Which makes the project become very weak and not meet the standards. When I was given a project on my favorite things to do, I aced it because it was about me and because it was about something that interested me. Giving students a project on what their are interested in gives the teacher a understanding on their point of views on situations and also helps them understand their students more. Giving students-designed projects rather than teacher-designed projects gives the student reassurance that they will get a good great on the project. Especially over the summer break, most students dont have any interest at all about teacher-designed projects. If the students can put their own twist and flavor into the project; the outcome would be very much better!"
16412,0,"Dear Principal, I don't think you should change the requirements to play sports to maintaining a B average. Not everybody can maintain a B average. Some things are harder for certain people. They may have got an A in Math because they get math but a D in Science because they don't fully understand how the body works. Not every body is going to be smart. Some people are smart and others aren't to bright. Some people may be athletic but some aren't at all. Very few people are smart and athletic. Different people have different gifts. If it is evident that they are trying in every class then they may just not get the material. Some people understand the most complex things but the easier theories just don't click in their heads. A lot of people have this problem and if they are going through an easy chapter and they don't understand but if they are doing most of their work it is evident that they just don't get it and maybe could use an extra hand. If the majority of the students have a C average it might not be the students that have the problem. Everybody learns different but if the teacher only explains the material the same way over and over the students aren't going to get it. The teacher may have to look up other way to teach the material so it can click in the other students minds. Sometimes teachers pick what is easier to teach instead of what will the students understand better. Sometimes the crowd can be sent off by the leader and only the crowd is effected badly."

A place that would normally take a day to walk, a car can get you there in hours. It seems that these cars are the most helpful thing that has been invented, besides silverwear. However They are also very dangerous. They let out toxic chemicals that are slowly hurting the Earth. Thats why They're some citys that are trying to boycot cars. One example is Vauban, a city in Germany. The community is has giving up driving cars. Driveways and garages are forbidden in this district and if you look at the streets they are empty of cars. All of this goes to the effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from cars tailpipes. In the United States, the Envionmental Protection Agency is promoting car reduced communites and A few people are starting to act. Even President Obam's has ambitious goals to curb the United States Greenhouse gas emissions. The United States is the world's prime car cultures. However America's obsession with vehicles is starting to decrease. The number of miles driven in the united states peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily. Also as of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak. Difernt things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift. Is it possible a recovery is underway? The next years will tell."
4375,0,"Did you have to do a project over the summer for school? If so that assignment was called a summer learning project and it's used to make sure students are learning over summer break. Although some might argue that the project should be student-designed, it should be a teacher-designed. Students being able to design their own summer projects would not make the project a leaning experience. A student would do the project on a topic that he/she already knows about instead of leaning something new because he/she would want to hurry up and go outside to enjoy the summer. For example, if a student already knows about the great depression and has to do a project on the topic about devastating things that has happened to the American economy he/she would write about the great depression because they already know what happened. There would be no need to go the library or research anything or learn something new. Teachers pick projects that will challenge his or her students to excel not only in the specific subject that he/she teaches but in life also. Teachers assign projects that will help their students do better in his or her class. For example, English teachers will assign a student a book to read that will have a theme that will be talked about throughout the entire year. Which allows students to be prepared in class and even do better in class because of the knowledge that they have gained by doing the project. Students will already have some insight on what the teacher expects and how they run their classroom based on the summer reading project. Teachers pick projects that keep students up to date on what's happening in society. Government teachers assign summer project that help students learn laws that can keep them safe and away from prison and also help save others. It also helps them learn about their state Governor and how they are helping the people in the city that they live in and how they can help bring about change to things that they might not like. Teacher based projects keep students connected with the outside world. Teachers should also pick the summer projects because it teachers student how to follow directions and how to be independent. It helps students learn how to only rely on themselves and not anyone else because you can not ask the teacher for help. The student has to learn how to do it themselves which is a skill everyone needs, it also teaches students how to follow directions, teacher gives out a rubric and the students must follow the rubric to get a good grade. If each student designed their own project each project would be different which would be thought for the teacher to grade and come up with a rubric for. Teachers should pick the summer reading because they only want what's best for their students. It helps them: learn,stay connected with the world, learn independence, and be an overall great student. If teachers keep picking the summer projects future students will become the important hard working men and women that will eventually run the world."
22666,0,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Some believe that attend classes from home is not great for the student. But others think that if you attend classes from home you learn so much more. Attending a school can get you ready in the real world then just attending classes from home. Those who say attending classes from home say that because teacher cant teach the way they want. They have to follow the way the schools wants you to learn. For example, the teacher does not want to teach some of the stuff hes given but he has to because at the end of the day this is his job and he does not want to lose his job. When your attending classes from home you have more sleep and you wont be tired because it will be at your own time. And also you dont have to be in a class that the teacher dont really like to teach because over time some teachers lose that feeling that they loved. However, people believe that attending schools is way better then just staying home. Some reasons you should attend school then stay home is that you will have more fun in a class room then just home all the time. For example, you will make friends and do stuff together the will make your time more joy able then just at home. you wake up and go to school you see your friends and you make jokes and help each other and it is limitless. Another reason you should attend school then classes at home. Schools have field trips,sports,after school activities that you will probably love to do. Because you have the chance to try all of them at school. For example, there are filed trips to the art museum that have great at works like the monalisa. And filed trips to New York and other places that you will love to see. Sport teams are like family, you watch each others back and help improve you game together and thats something you cant get from home or video conferencing. Other reason why you should attend school with others is that someday you will find a bond with someone or a group that will last and you will be grateful for. For example, There were couples in high school that later on got married and there were these groups that became friends actually the became family. In conclusion, Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Some believe that attend classes from home is not great for the student. But others think that if you attend classes from home you learn so much more. Attending school is better for your kids in the long run. You can learn more in school then you could ever at home and you will make friend and maybe family."
11486,0,"I think this technology might be helpful for students, but it could also be a bad thing. It could be good for students becase it would show how they really feel about the work so the teacher would know that their confused, bored, or angry. In the paragraph 3 it talks about what it is capible of in facial recognizion and how it could chage a lesson to better suit a student just by their facial expression. I also believe it could be a bad thing. For example would you like someone to know what you're thinking just by your exepression. Lets say your're talking to a friend of yours and they ask you what you think about their favorite song and you know its their favorite song, but you really don't like it all and you dont want to maybe hurt their feelings by saying what you really think, so you might say "" it's ok"" or ""not my style"". Now think if this technology was out there that you might not be able to do that, and you might not be able to hide how you really feel. That is why I think this technology could be a good thing and a bad thing."

In essay form, explain if drivers should or should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. How many people die yearly from texting and driving? Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. 1 out of 4 accidents are caused in the united states by texting and driving. Drivers should not be able to operate cell phone use while driving, it causes the driver to get distracted from the road and that could cause the driver to have an accident. However, some drivers may still respond to a text message and that is why many of the accidents occurs and most of the time this lead to a vehicle accident that could lead to death. Drivers need to understand how easily it is to take someone life or themselves. Everyday people are risking their lives due to the high rate of cell phone use while operating a vehicle. Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are a distraction to drivers while their on the road. Because of their conversation they might get upset and this could lower their driving ability that can lead them to lose control over the car. If people don't make the right decision and put their cell phone away while driving their routine could harm innocent people. Some people may feel uncomfortable without their cell phone mainly because they are so use to having their cell phone in hand while driving. On the other hand there are disadvantages of using cell phones, they can easily get lost. Talking on cell phones are very expensive. In addition, cell phones are not useful while driving, drivers should pay attention to the road instead of getting distracted from a text or phone call. In conclusion, I think that cell phones are indispensable tools that we cannot live without, but we should avoid using them while operating a vehicle. Therefore, we should think carefully about the advantages of cell phone use while on the road. You should ask yourself is it worth risking your life or someone else life. We should be able to operate cell phones responsibly and use them at the right time."

It has always been a want in sociaty. In paragraph two, ""Television and movies have long been fascinated with cars that could drive themselves."" People have been imagining this for years and have been pursuring the topic since the year 2009. Driverless cars may be a bit more to make and sell but they would save lots of money on gas, taxis, buses, ect. In paragraph three the passage talks about how people have been trying to do this for years, since the 1950's even! Not only would it be what people want but it will eventually be what sociaty needs. For safer roads as the article says, we dont need safer drivers or safer cars but safer roads. With this being said, roads with only driverless cars would have very minium problems, accidents and what not. This wouldn't be a so callled easy or quick prosses with getting these cars out on the road as soon as possile either, minor problems/faults with still occur. Monitoring these vehicles as they drives where ever is a smart thing because they can see how and why these errors happen, to be fixed. In the article it talks about how people would still be able to drive these cars like normal if it is a desire. Here is where the idea wouldn't turn away people that like driving. Driverless cars is again, one of the best ideas for our future. It is smart, safe, engery sufficiant, and logical way of transportation in the time ahead of us. Car manufactors have been and are pursuing this as it is, making it safer, smarter and better all around everyday."
19367,0,"Dear Mr. State Senator, I have been a citizen of the United States for my entire life, and through my studies, research, and personal experiences with the Electoral College system, I have come to the conclusion that the Electoral college system is not only an out of date way of casting a vote, but also an ineffective way of electing a president. I believe that the popular vote both directly reflects and accuretly shows which politician citizens have chosen will best lead our country. The Electoral College is merely a way for politicians to attempt to swing the vote in their favor by paying more attention to states that contain more electors. Politicians should be concerned about gaining the votes of individuals, regardless of how many Electoral College members their states contain. There is very little need for the electoral college even to exist at all. There is absolutely no point in having two ways for collecting the votes of citizens when all that the system requires is for one of the candidates to gather more votes than the other. Having the Electoral College does not help the voting process and therefore will only harm or make the process of electing a president ineffective. In many cases, the votes of the Electoral College go against what the popular votes want and tend to cause an unwanted politician to go into office. I am not the only citizen concerned about this system, there are people all across the United States who dislike the Electoral College and who see that it constantly gets in the way of electing a decent president into office. There have been politicians, Chamber of Commerce members, and everyday citizens who have stood up aginst this awefull Electoral College and who have realized just how terrible and ineffective it is. Putting this system out of commission will be no easy task, but if enough citizens like myself write to their local, state, and federal congress members, change just might be possible. Though a group effort would be required to destroy this system, it would be extremely difficult to convince politicians and presidents that have been in office for years to destroy this College that allowed for them to go into office. It would also be exceptionally difficult to get all three branches of the United States government to destroy the Electoral College, afterall.. it would only take the president's veto to stop it from being removed. There are counter claims to mine that I'm sure you will recieve within your time in office, counter claims that you should'nt ignore. I think that you should look over all of the evidence, all of the facts, and all of the sources that you can inorder to form your opinion as to whether or not the Electoral College should stay, or it should be terminated. Some of the claims that you will recieve will not have much basis and will most likely state that the system has been in existence ever since the founding of the United States. These claims are not based on evidence of the system being correct or being fair, these calims are based on a fear of change. Change tends to scare people, especially when their power of voting may be altered due to a major change to the U.S. government. But over the past several decades alone, our country has undergone many wonderful changes and experiences that have positively affected its citizens and its laws. Two of these changes include the desegregating of schools and the right for women to vote. These changes are extremely positive, just like the destroying of the Electoral College would be. It would have a positive impact on all of the country's citizens and would allow for the United States to show that it too can change and adapt for the better. I am not writing this letter to you because i think that you can single handidly change the voting system of the United States, I am writing this letter to you because I have faith that you can help change the opinion of your fellow politicians and State leaders. I hope that you use the facts and research that I have presented to you today and continue to gather more evidence on the Electoral College system and why it is holding back our country from properly electing its presidents. Thank you very much for both your time and your consideration, I wish you luck on changing the system and informing others about the problem. Sincerely, PROPER_NAME ©"
24241,0,"To begin with, I personally think students wouldn't benefit taking school online and these are my reasons why. I think that some students wouldn't benefit from taking classes at home, Just because they wouldn't understand what they are learning and It would be harder for them to actually understand the concept and do the work. The students wouldn't have help from a teacher when they don't understand something or when they need help. some students would'nt be able to concentrate on doing the work because they may be distracted by something going on around the house. May have things to do around the house and wouldn't be able to do his work and turn in work on time. The student would find a way to get the answers rather then learning the concept. The students won't learn a lot about things that some classes teach you such as, learning how to manage money and in school they can teach you those things step by step. They wouldn't be use to waking up every morning and if they have a job they would wake up or be late because they weren't use to waking up early every day just like the students that go to school."

Going off of that, technology is used more and more in the educational system, with classes using computers and i-pads for everyday acivities. The Facial Action Coding System would be a perfect addition to the educational sytem and could even make a huge impact on average people's everyday lives. Technology in schools is a wonderful tool, offering millions if not billions of different sources and programs online with the click of a button. When used properly, students can grandly enhance their learning skills with the use of technology. However not every program, resource, or tool works for every single student, which is where the Facial Action Coding System would come in. Using this device, teachers can potentially get feedback on whether student's are enjoying what they are doing, what one could do to make a student's learning experience better, and with this device a teacher could even tell if their class is confused or bored. Since emotional expression are so important in a classroom, a teacher could potentially even modify the lesson plan based off of the overall moof of the class. This invention is groundbreaking on it's own, and bringing it into the educational system with it's proper use and encorporation, could be of tremendous help to the United States educational system."

This new sofeware called Facial Action Coding System is proven to read six basic facial emotions such as, happiness, surprised, anger, disgust, fear, and saddness. The sofeware is like math it can calculate you all your forty-four major facial muscles and calculate your emotion. For like example, if you raise both of you eye brows it most likley means that your facial expression is showing that your suprised to hear or see something. I think that this sofeware is a pretty nice technology that can be usefull if your a teacher, rehabilatation center helper. For a teacher it can be a good technology to use at school so you can know more about the kids facial expression. It'll become a great technology for a rehabilatation center,for veteran solders the have gone through a lot and are hiding other extra emotions. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advance Sience at the University of Amsterdam did a great sofeware that will become very usefull to many places.

The author talks about how going to Venus will be very hard but not impossible, and that maybe a long time ago Venus could've been a place to live in because it has almost the same size, density, and distance to the Sun as Earth. NASA has even had missions to go to Venus, but the author says because of it's thick cloud of carbon dioxide (97 percent) spacecrafts are not able to make an apropriate landing on Venus, that is also a reason why humans have not been sent to Venus for it's dangerous high pressure and sulfuric acid clouds. The article also states that like Earth, Venus also causes many natural disasters and weather storms like ""eruptung volcanoes, powerful earthhquakes, and frequent lightning strikes."" Scientist are still trying to find ways to go to Venus but not into Venus because it is very hard and dangerous. NASA can make ships capable of hovering over Venus so they can take pictures of Venus inside it's atmosphere, but also because of the thick cloud no light is strong enough to go through the clouds and to do this spacecrafts need to be able to resist the outside atmosphere temperatures of 170 degrees Fahrenheit. In conclusion, traveling to Venus and studying it is a difficult mission but not impossible, the author says that ""Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents."" The author fully supports his idea by what the article talks about and the dangers humans will confront."

I think that it's cool that just scanning someones face can help you know what their real emotions are. The thing I like most about the article is that it says ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" I love how Dr. Huang could tell what Mona Lisa's emotions were by looking through a screen called Facial Action Coding System. In paragraph three, it tells you that the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face. It scans the 44 major muscles in the model like human muscles. He founded out that there are 6 facial expressions a person can have like, happiness, surprise, anger, digust, fear, and sadness. I love how it can tell if your are making a fake smile or real smile by looking at your mouth. Usually if you're actually happy, your cheeks and eyebrows raise up and if you weren't smiling real then your lips wouldn't go up they would just move sideways and it wouldn't go up."
25370,0,"Would you ask more then one person for advice? If so why would you? Because on my opinion I think that it would be good to ask other people for their advice on something, because some people could give you different advice, they can help you pick rather or not you should do something, and also you can see who are the people that are willing to help you with some good advice. Now I would like to talk about why it would be good to get advice from multiple people. I think it is good because I have had a moment when I did not know if I should still be friends with someone I knew had talked behind my back so I started to ask some friend and family members to see what they think about it. Now know they where completely honest with me, so one of my family members told me if what she said hurt me in any type of way then to just stop talking to her. So then I kept asking and they kept giving me different advice, so what I did was I put everything together and it all added up in a way so that is how I got my answer to what I should do. That is why it is good to ask different people for advice because some could give you the same advice and some wont. Now some advice can be good but some are not always good. And it is good to get advice because when you are about to do something you wont have to worry that you are going to do something bad because if the person that you talked to gave you good advice you dont have to worry. Why is it good to know other peoples opinion? Let me tell you why it is good to know, because if you tell them something then of course they will stop and think then be like you should not do that because you could hurt your self, nor you can hurt the other person. Because then they would tell you why it is a good idea and why it is not. I have been in a situation like that as well where I wanted to do something so i just wanted to make sure that what I was about to do would not hurt any one in any type of way so my cousin started to give me reasons to why I should not do it. I ended up listening to her but then I realized that if I never asked her if it was a good idea I would have made a huge mistake. And that is what I want you to notice that if you are about to do somewhere rather it is to your self or someone else try talking to someone,and ask them for advice because really it could help. And they can all make sure that you and everyone else are okay. So really knowing other peoples opinion really just a good choice to make because it is helping you. Now this one is my favorite. Witch is that asking for advice lets you see who are the true friends that are acutely willing to give you advice, and good advice not bad. Because people always have that one friend that is willing to help but not help you in a good way more like in a bad way, because most times let me start of small you ask them a question "" oh does this one look good on me or that one"" and they will answer back with the one they think looks ugly and you know they are picking the ugly one but you just pick not to say anything. Now let me go big if you ask them for advice on something serious they will tell you oh yeah you should do it because it wont harm anyone, but no they just want to put lies in your head so that when people with actual good advice come you will be confused and not know what to do. So it is better to know when a friend is just lying to you because you want a friend that tells you the truth and that you can trust with really anything and you know that their advice wont be bad. Also when you ask any one in particular for advice know that people are not always right so every time you need to make a decision and need advice go with what your head tells you to not always with what other people tell you. So really that is what I think could help people notice that asking different people for advice is really help full because when you get different ideas from multiple people you have a lot of choices and you get to pick the best one out of all the choices you got but of course you would know rather or not what they told you was good and helpful because if it was not then obviously do not use it. But really my point here is if you ask more then one person for help it can really help you out, because imagine you where going to do something and a part of you is saying dont do it but the other part of you is saying you should do it. Then of course you will need someone to give you advice to what you should do because if it was something bad then that would not be good. So really it is best to just ask someone for their opinion. Because it is always better to do something when someone tells you that it is okay then always doing things by yourself and end up ruining something. So real question here is would you ever ask for someone else opinion?"

In Paris after days of near-record pollution, Paris decided to ban driving to clear the air of the global city. In BOGOTA, Colombia it has been the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis. The United States of America has even passed their peak of driving in 2005 and dropped steadily since. Giving up your car may seem very hard to you, but for the people in VAUBAN, Germany seem to like it much better. In fact street parking, driveways, and home garages are forbidden in this experimental new district. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park-large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys space, for $40,000, along with a home. Nearly 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars they seem to be much happier this way. After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air. On monday people with even-numbered liscence plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a fine of 22-euro. The same would apply for odd-numbered plates the next day. Nearly 4000 drivers were fined and 27 drivers cars were impounded for their reaction to the fine. In BOGOTA, Colombia they were in a program to spread to oher countries. They were on their third straight year that cars have been banned. Although buses and taxis were permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violaters faced a $25 fine. I think this is a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. And this is a revolutionary change."

Also, in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the Zygomatic major and a different muscle called The Risorius. But to an expert, faces don't lie, these muscles clues are somtimes used tto spot a ""smiling"" politician or celbrity isn't being truthful. For example if you're feeling sad and your friend tells a funny joke you can fake a smile your friends won't even relize your faking a smile. Also a renowned drama coach, Constantin Stanislavsky, he had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowing (what a great way to practice) as a way of creating these emotions on stage and i think that's a really great way to practice because if they go up on stage and don't know how to do a really great emotion their drama teacher might get angry. In conclusion i think have a drama teacher teaching you how to do an emotion right and having computers to tell if your happy or sad or angry is a good thing to have in the world."

Although it may be summer some schools still require that students complete a summer project to assure they are still learning. All summer projects should be student-designed because they'll be able to more creative as well as they'll understand the assignment better. Often students get confused when assigned projects over the summer one of the main reasons are because they don't understand the topic. By allowing the students to design there own assignments will help them make their project more detailed. For example, a student could take a family vacation out of town once they've arrived back home they could design a detailed poster board of all the historical sites they saw while on vacation. Also, In the summer most kids volunteer and do other stuff around the community a student could type an essay as their summer project about the importance of giving back. During the summer the teacher most likely won't be available to answer any questions, comments, or concerns. If the project is student-designed then there will be no need for the students to reach out to there teachers because they'll have all the information they need because they're creating they're own topic for the project. Although, some teachers or even students may feel that the summer projects should be teacher-designed because it allows the teacher to know exactly what they're grading,others feels it limits creativity for the students. When assigned a project there is usually a rubric the teachers hand out. Students feel as if this limits them to there creative abilities because they have to follow a rubric that tells them exactly how everything has to be done. Students want to have control over there summer projects so when they return to school they will be more confident presenting the projects. Teachers will be able to grade the students based off of their creativity and see that the student took there time and worked hard over the summer on the assignment.When students design their own work without any guidelines they're allowed to be more creative as well as more detailed in their work. In conclusion, students should be allowed to design their own summer projects because theyll understand it better as well as show there creativity in their work."
19827,0,"Most people were raised on fairness; what everybody wants. So shouldn't voting be the same way? Thats why America should have popularity voting because electoral voting is unconstitutional, it doesn't give little states a say so and it's plain unfair. First of all, Popularity voting should be the way we vote because it's constitutional. Abraham Lincoln once stated that ""this is a nation for the people, by the people, and from the people""; its part of the constitution. Also, this is one nation under god and the almighty father believes in fairness; wouldn't you agree the people deserve a say so? Popularity voting allows the people to show what they support instead of electorals not serving the people justice. Electoral voting allows segergation because some states don't get a say so, but the question is aren't we one nation? The constitution says all men are equal;so what makes a man in California better than a man in North Carolina? So that's one strike for electoral voting. Furthermore, popularity voting gives little states a say so. Did you know that small states like Rhode Island, South Carolina, and other 15 states sometimes don't get to see candidates? It's unfair that electoral voting only aims for states with high electoral voting. Popularity voting will change that giving little states a say so will heighten the ratio and maybe change the outcome. Popularity voting allows small states to put their opinion in on who they want as president because they are part of the country as well. Electoral treats smalll states like they don't matter and it's time to change that; Electoral voting now has two strikes. Finally, popularity voting is just fair. Everyone born in America was born into the land of the free, land of the equal, land of the brave, so why shouldn't voting be like that? Everyone deserves the right to pick who they want to represent them, and if not its abusing their rights. Popularity voting is the clear choice because electoral voting is unfair, they obstrain your rights and your freedom of speech; you deserve to say who you want in office. They rather put you on mute and say you don't matter; we have to stand up. Electoral voting that was your last straw. In conclusion, America should have popularity voting because electoral voting is unconstitutional, it doesn't give little states a say so and it's plain unfair. Also popularity voting is now the most popular voting style. We as Americans are tired of being treated unfairly and we are sticking to our national slogan; three strikes your out so good-bye electoral voting."
24433,0,"The United States has one of the worst public school systems in the modern world. Places like Sweden and Denmark show fantastic, flawless designs that allow students to properly use their time for both school and non-school activities. Our public schools, however, show many flaws that were enacted by generations in the past. Students fail to learn proper time management, as they are forced to go to places they are unfamiliar with and follow prepared schedules in and out of class. As this continued, the government discovered the flaws and are beginning to try new solutions. One of these solutions is online classes that students can take at home. I believe that Students would benefit from online learning because it allows the students to learn in places more familiar to them, relearn challenging information, and build proper time management skills. One of the systems' largest problem is forcing students to attend and learn in places that are unfamiliar and daunting to them. According to majority of students in a poll last year, research has shown that students consider school buildings as uncomfortable, as well as unfamiliar. On that same poll, the same research claimed that students found the idea of learning at home appealing, and a much better suited place to learn. This same evidence supports the ideas that parents whose children are in homeschooling programs share. Hearts, a homeschooling program ran through Generic_City and all over the east coast, has a much larger graduation rate in students and higher averaged grades than public schools in the same areas. Some people could argue that this holds the threat of exposing distractions to students. With the ability to modify their own environment, students can create their own spaces that allow them to concentrate on their studies with ease. All of this information supports the idea that learning at home is a working solution that the government should endorse and improve within their schools. The second reason that online classing would be a good idea is the ability to allow students to study specifically hard material. Majority of current online classing has a system that allows teachers to record or stream lectures that explain the material. Then, if students had questions, the teacher could answer them in the stream or message the students independently. This method is fantastic, because all of the lectures can be recorded and shown for future reference at other times. If students didn't understand the material, they could just load up the needed information and relearn it and solidify the information into their memory. With this, students can make sure that they received and understood all of the content that they need to know for the classes that they are taking. Finally, online classing would give students the opportunity to learn valuable time management skills. Along with having control over setting, students would be given control over how they use their time. Homeschooled students often have a lot of time to allocate for school and other activities. This is essential for every student to understand and master, as they will have the same choices when they grow into adults. Students who have other obligations outside of school will be allowed to modify their learning time each day, as well as take breaks from work as needed. Many people argue that students can abuse this opportunity as to skip learning altogether, and allow them to grow bad habits. The entire purpose behind having the choice is to learn from mistakes. If no mistakes were made, then no one could improve. Online classing allows students to learn what to do in a safe and open environment. Without that chance, students would make the same mistakes in more important matters, and harm their well being later in life. The largest flaw that has been located is this: some students benefit more from learning in person rather than online. The beauty behind this whole process is that online classes don't eliminate the ability to have face to face classroom interactions that students have today. Yes, online classes are meant to somewhat eliminate this factor, but in person interactions are also needed to have students grow. Hearts, the program mentioned above, has a system that has students meet their teachers in person once or twice a week. This allows teachers to show students real life applications with the information taught in class, as well as give students the ability to have social interaction with both teachers and other students. This allows the students to gain the pros of both online classing and the modern classroom interaction Students would benefit from online learning because it allows the students to learn in places more familiar to them, relearn challenging topics and units, and build proper time management skills. Throughout this article, evidence has been placed that support all three of these factors. Learning at home gives the students the ability to be taught in more comfortable environments rather than the common classroom. The ability to relearn lectures and other class materials allow students to master the topics given to them. Time management skills can be learned, as the students are given control over the ability to use their time in ways that they think is best. Even some of the common flaws of online classing has been addressed and solved. The ability to change the way we learn is something that I believe is essential to allow minds to reach their highest potential. No one learns the same way as the person next to them. That is why if people are starved of the choice to learn the way that they want, then us as a country will not be able to grow along with the rest of the world. If this method is amplified and improved, then America can become one of the most educated countries on earth."
16886,0,"Car accidents have become a growing problem around the world. Anything from drunk driving to texting and driving has caused people to injure and even take the lives of many people. The development of computer-driven cars have the purpose of using innovative technology to prevent these events from occuring while also allowing drivers to have more freedom behind the wheel. Everyone should switch to computer-driven cars once they are fully developed because they contain sensors that allow the car to carry out many of its own functions, are able to alert the driver if their assistance is needed, and have in-car systems that prevent accidents that would occur through texting and driving. To begin, these computer-driven cars already have many featurres that allow the car to do the same thing as if a human was driving. The article on driverless cars states,¨ BMW announced the development of ¨Traffic Jam assistant.¨ The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph.¨(driverless cars are coming 7) allowing everyday drives to the gas station or the grocery store to be eliminated and the simple act of getting into the car as if it were a cab, to be carried out. Also,¨ They can steer, acelerate, and brake themselves.¨ (driverless cars are coming 7) shows that the cars are just as handy as if a human was driving them. Next, other sensors alert the driver as needed. In case there is construction or another type of barrier that might confuse a driverless car, there are sensors to alert the human in the car that they are needed. The driverless cars will have installed,¨ in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays.¨(driverless cars are coming 8) allowing for a fun ¨Drive¨ to the destination while also having a safe one. To further support this idea,""Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over.¨ (driverless cars are coming 8) reassures the idea that one can enjoy the ride while also knowing they are safe and can take over when necessary. Lastly, driverless cars can prevent accidents caused by cell phone use while driving. Cell phone users are not aware of where the car is going if they are looking at their phone. When the article says,¨ something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone.¨ (driverless cars are coming 8) reffering to the heads-up system, it creates a feeling of saftey knowing one can still be interacting with technology while being aware of what is going on with the car. Also, ¨ In this way, the car-system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big concern.¨ ( driverless cars are coming 8) seals the deal that driverless cars are a innovative new way to prevent accidents through cell phone use. The ability to carry out similar functions as if a human were driving, the addition of sensors that alert the driver when needed, and the ability to prevent more car accidents through cell phone use are what make driverless cars a necessity to the world. Though some have argued it would be hard to trust the technology, tests have proven otherwise. The technology and innovativness of the car are very promising. Ultimately, having a driverless cars is what everyone needs."

He went on a ship to go other places and help and on board he found some time to be him and just have fun. On lukes second trip he served watch men. He was to check on all of the animals and it was rainy out and he sliped and fell down very wet steps he almost slid out of the boat but a lucky peace of meatal beam was there and he stop right before he went out of an open side of the boat. but this put him on medical leave so he couldent work so I bet he was a little upset that he couldent help on the boat or where ever they stoped to help on land. He had fun with table tennis tournements fencing boxing reaidin and whittling the games he played helped pass time on the bout and just relaxe for a wile and have some fun. He said being a seagoing was much more than an adventure for luke boberger. He is greatful for this oppertunity he says and made it more aware to people in other countrys that that had food and nice people to give it to them.

The Face is a natural lanform and was not created by aliens. The captin of NASA at the time said it was a ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" The Face wasnt a face it was just the shadowing and placement of where the photo was taken from. ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared o a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" This was after more clearer pctures were taken and it looked just like a landform, nothing else.

17151,0,"Driverless cars should continue their development. Having driverless cars could be a major improvment on the world. The amount of crashes that occur each year could decrease, because of the reckless driving that occurs and the amount of money we give to fuel taxes will also decrease tremendously. these smart cars will lessen the dangers on the road. Making these driverless cars will not be cheap investment. All the technology and test practices to make this car 100% driverless will take time and will cost money. But all the time and money put into this project will be worth in in the end. This car will have far better responces and control than a human could ever accomplish by themselves. As the technology becomes better over the years soon the cars will become completely driverless and will be able to detect all the dangers and hazards happening around the vehicle. Human drivers can't detect every single hazard on the road, it is just to overwhelming. Driverless cars are the new future of cars. They are able to provide a safe enviroment for the passengers inside of the vehicle. They will lessen the amount of fuel money we put into our cars each day and protect people from dangerous drivers and road conditions. Driverless cars shoud most defintely continue their development."
20196,0,"The electoral college,they decide what we vote on based on what they think our state would choose for president. To me the country has it all wrong, I think we as US citizens should let our votes decide on who should be president. Even though things may get done quicker I think everyones voice should be heard. People like Bob Dole Jimmy Carter and Richard Nixon have tried to get rid of the electoral college. Plus the electoral college cost Al Gore his presidency would've also liked to have their voices heard in the 2000 election. and im pretty sure people would agree with me the 60% of the population of voters would like their voice to be heard. The electoral college has a weird way of how they run and choose. Like the example in ""whats wrong with the electoral college"" it saiys that ""if someone lived in Texas and they wanted to vote for John Kerry you'd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to John Kerry and then John Kerry would have 34 electoral votes."" If it were based on popular vote the points would be split to the person based on the number of votes they got. Even though other situations like in 2012 when obama won the election he recived a 61% of the electoral college's votes while the popular votes he recived was 51% a 10% difference, even though he still would've won it would've been more fair to let the popular votes decide. Some say its best to have a bias voter choose because they wont choose someone based on what everyone else's opinion is, like how the south favored romney over obama but to me that could be bad beacause what if who we choose actually has good ideas the college wouldve just go for the other guy. The ""winner-take-all"" method happens in swing states like Florida,us and other states have a big part on who we choose to run our country we usually pay attention to all the debates and campaings because we think our leader should know what he's doing swing states and big states are places a presidential campaign would take place the like to ensure they get their votes where it counts to guarentee a lead. the electoral college doesnt go to good for people who dont agree to their sides view like ""republicans in California or democrats in Texas"" their voices arent heard the popular votes might've gotten some points to save their canidate. in conclusion the electoral college is blocking the right to vote for who we want and have their voices heard even if that person were a republican in California. the popular vote should have some say on who will run the country."
10838,0,"The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students is valuable. It is valuable because in this passage ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" in paragraph six it gives the example of computers more specefically classroom computers and what could be possible for education some years down the road to improve students learning. In paragraph six we get evidence from ""Dr. Huang"" telling us how this could possibly be like a good human instructor like a teacher. The evidence proving this comes from ""Dr. Huang"" himself he says ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" basically ""Dr. Huang"" is saying of course down the road in the future a classroom computer can recognize students emotion and make constant changes to the students lesson on the computer to make a effective lesson like an actual human teacher. Thus proving that this technology to read a students expressions in a classroom is valuable. Another example proving that the use of this technology to read a students expressions in the classroom is valuable because in education there is alot of classes and alot of technology classes you can chose from one of the many technology based classes is Web Design. Again in paragraph six we could see a huge increase in technology more specfically animated faces. For instance in paragraph six we get evidence of how the same technology can make computer animated faces alot more expressive. Here is evidence ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive-"" again proving how this technology to read the emotions of students in class is actually valuable. Another piece of evidence proving this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because in fact there are colleges out there that do offer video game based classes this could be another advantage. It is an advantage because video games are technology and since colleges are offering classes based on videogames this could really increase the learning atmosphere for each and everyone of those students who take that course. A piece of evidence would also again be found in paragraph six where it states ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive- for videogames"". This is proving that this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom or a videogame course in this case is valuable. Another piece of evidence is how we first found this technology back in paragraph one the very end of it we get some background information on how this technology was found. We get the evidence that this sofware is the latest discovery from ""Prof. Thomas Huang"" of ""Beckman Institute for Advanced Science"" at the ""University of Amsterdam"". Just knowing that Professor Thomas Huang may not be a student but is teaching this software to his students in classroom is for sure valuable. We even get this really nice piece of evidence ""Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate"". This is saying Huang and his colleague are making this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in classrooms is valuable. In conclusion the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is super valuable from videogames, professors to classroom computers and even just improving being able to read facial expressions is important because after all most of the human communication is nonverbal meaning not talking it is just simply ""emotional communication"". Also it says in the very begining that this new revolutionary software has promising applications for a good ammount of industries. Proving that the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable thus improving the already flourshing education of all the students who take grasp of this. Leading on to a brighter and better future for everyone in the world."
15117,0,"Dear Principle, I believe that not letting students participate in sports without a B average is a good idea. Students active in sports generally don't have much time for studying and homework because they are so occupied in their sport and are too busy with practices. If a student has a B average in school, then they most likely are a hard-working student that believes their grades are very important. If they have a lower grade average, then it is possible that the student will slip farther behind in class and have assignments piled up. Students that participate in sports have practices very frequently and usually after school. If a student is working on sports and practicing so hard and so much, they will not have much time for homework. If they start to fall behind on homework, they don't finish it or they get points taken off, or they don't learn anything from a class discussion that refers to the homework. If a student has a B average in school they are generally a hard worker and will find a way to juggle both school and sports and wont slip behind as quickly and they might if they had a C average and were already having a hard time understanding some concepts in the curriculum. Students in sports get home after practice exhausted and will most likely need to rest afterwards, creating a smaller gap of time for homework and studying. After resting, a C average student will start on his or her homework and probably need to figure it out first, read directions, then start having trouble part way through the homework, and it might take them more time to get it complete, then they will get frustrated and give up, not finishing. A B average student would rest up quickly and work hard on their homework to make up for the time they missed while at practice and not stop until it is completely finished, then check their answers and the next day will eagerly engage in the discussion on it A B average student will take notes in class and work hard on assignments when a C average student might slack off a little, or not try as hard in class as others might. With sports concerned, the C average student will begin slacking off more and falling behind and will only be able to think about their next practice, concentrating on only sports. A B average student will focus on school very hard to keep their grades up so they can continue to be in sports. A rule that only B average students or higher can play in sports will be good for the students who work hard and might encourage students to keep their grades up so they too could be in sports and could easily boost the schools grade average and help kids learn better."

As the passive provides, ""Empathy ( feeling someone ele's emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions"" (Nick D'Alto). This showes the readers that really anyone can change there emotions and make you think they feel this way because we have the ability to change just how we feel, we have self control over it. people can creat a facial expression like how they do in acting when they computure reads your face. So if i person wants to express how they feel wth other they will tell you, but you dont need technolgy to have a person tell u how they feel."" For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face"" ( Nick D'Alto). This showing that a human eye can detect the emotion by a facial expression."" Imagin a computer that knows when you're happy or sad"" ( Nick D'Alto) First off that would be creepy but, most important can a computure change the way you feel by telling you how you feel? Wouldnt you know how you feel? "" A classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confusted or bored,"" DR. HUnang predicts. If you look at a students face you can tell by they way there face expression is that they are confused or bored. Plus you in school most likley your bored. If a student is confused they are also able to ask any questions. Most students feel stupid when they as what something is or what it means, but not asking doesnt help. So you can truly tell how people feel."

We can't view asking for help or advice as a weakness. We first need to observe the benefits. Wisdom, different perspectives and satisfaction are all reasons why seeking multiple opinions is so great. Wisdom plays a big role in decision making. There are people that have been through what you are going through, and can give you sound advice. This advice can be better than normal advice because not only do they understand the situation, they probably know what you've been going through on top of that. These people have learned from mistakes they have made, and know how to avoid them. Seeking an opinion from someone with experience will always be a sound decision. We often count out people with opinions that aren't similar ours, but we fail to realize the reason for varying perspectives. When faced with a decision to make, no matter how small, our judgment can become clouded. To another person who isn't dealing with that problem at first hand, things look a little clearer for them. They can provide an unbiased opinion that you probably needed. These people can also open you up to ideas that you hadn't even considered. When it's all said and done, sometimes we don't end up with the outcome we would have preferred.

19060,0,"Many people are not in favor of keeping the Electoral College. Many prefer changing the election by popular vote for the president of the United States since the Electoral College is unfair. It is. The electoral college is unfair in many ways and we should change it to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. One reason why the United States should change the election to popular vote instead of the Electoral College is because the states aren't all equal and electoral college isn't fair. In the Electoral College, California has more of a say than Georgia. California has 55 electoral college, while Georgia has 16. How is that fair? ""Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning"" (Plumer 13). This line tells us that candidates stay out of states that they know they won't win. Say there was a candidate campaigning, they will most likely focus on the states that have the most electoral college, like California or Texas. They won't go to states that only have three votes. That's not fair to the states that have a small population. ""It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes"" (Posner 6). If electoral votes wasn't a thing, Gore would be president. He's the candidate that won most popular votes, meaning that he got the most votes in the nation. ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always"" (Plumer 10). Not always? What's the point of voting if the vote won't even count? Another reason why the United States should change the election to popular vote is because the popular vote will be more precise and it's much easier. There could be less ties, and the candidate that everyone really wants as president will become the president. ""Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes"" (Posner 16). Gore was the candidate that everyone wanted as president. It just doesn't seem fair that the candidate that won popular vote, isn't or wasn't the president. Overall, the people should change the election to popular vote for the president of the United States instead of using a system that is unfair to the states and the people."

There are many things that you can say about having driverless cars, some main things would be having that type of money for it, the different dangers that can occur, and as well on how it will benefit us, humans, and our lifestyle. With all this technology advancing anytime soon there will be cars like these that will be driving themselves without having an actual person driving them and this is coming very quick. As said in the article, ""Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020.

Driverless Cars coming, there is also danger and percaution that comes along with is as well. That is something very important that people need to still take into consideration when buying cars like these and all the different effects it has. As stated in the article, "" This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires. This necessitates the car bing ready to quickly get the driver's attention whenever a problem occurs.""

Taking into deep considerarion, will these vehicles benefit us and the way we live now? Many people can say it will, and then there are people that will say no, it will not. Imagining how much money it will take to afford a driverless car is also something to think about as well. In the article it informs us about all the different things these vehicles can do, ""They can steer, acclerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" As much as it says in the article how they are ""driverless"" they still do need humans when it comes to certain occasions. So in the end it is your personal prefrence about being able to please yourself with a fance vehicle like these. Finally, what do you think the world will be like when these driverless cars come out? This world is growing in the world of technology there will always be different, exotic, marvalous, inventions that are coming and with all these crazy things so are the Driverless Cars Are Coming!"

Some reasons I think why advises helps is keeps you safe, makes goal come true, and makes changes. The reason I think advises help is keeps you safe. There are many dangerous people and thing in the world. That could hurt you in so many ways. When I got invited to a sixteen and up birthday party. I was so ready to go but i didnt know if i should go to the party. So i asked my mom for advice. Then she told me it wouldn't be the best idea,I could get kidnapped. I agreed with her and didn't go. That advice from my mom saved me from getting kidnapped. Another reason I think Advises help is make goals come true. Getting to your goal is pretty hard. But if you have someone to push you through it you can do it. When I gave up on becoming an Artist. My friend told me some advice telling I need to keep going until i reached my goal. And said she cheering for me. I felt hopeful again and happy that she there for me. The last reason I think advises help is makes changes. Words are powerful and so are action. They can make things happen with multiple of them. At our school,the lunches are very unhealthy. We tell our teacher but they didn't listen. So we interview people around the school and asked them to sign a paper. Once we were done. We when over to the school board. And told them about the unhealthy lunches at schools. They agreed that schools should change their lunches to healthier lunches. And changed the lunches served a schools. Advises can be helpful or not helpful. But if it can help you then please listen to it. Don't block it out.So many people think it's useless. But it help in so many like keep you safe,make goals come true or makes changes. You can't do everything on your. Sometime it's better to ask for help."
25587,0,"Having different opinions can help an individual a lot, even though you may not realize it. Your way of life can come from your parent's, grandparent's, and even your own opinion. Therefore It is very good to listen to your peers, they might have information that you never even imagined to think about, they can improve your character without you even knowing. This is why I think getting different opinions is a spectacular life skill to have and will help you in many different ways. Whether it comes to picking out an outfit, or watching the news, I like to have more than one opinion on what I should be wearing, or hearing on the news. Especially in politics, I advise you to listen to more than one channel on the television to prevent bias. One station could be feeding you false information that will prevent you from knowing what is right. If you listen to two or more channels, you can piece them all together and learn something from it. For example you might have learned from an article that a local grocery store was selling horribly infected apples. Then you ask your parents and they say it was one apple with a worm in it. The article was over exaggerating just to make a big deal out of it and make money off of it. Different views can also help support you when it comes to applying for a college and job interviews, and when you have that job one day, you will want to know what to say, and when to say it. Communication is another key life skill that having different views on different things may come in handy. When it comes to negotiating with a car dealer to attempt to get a new car, you will need to be prepared so you can both be happy. Communication is something in life you will use quite frequently, and I recommend attempting to master, because it can make someone's day in a heart beat if you use opinionated conversations the right way. You can even spark a pleasant conversation with your neighbor by asking them about football if they are big football fans, especially if you both like the same team. A specific opinion is needed here as well because you might have learned in the past that your neighbor does not like to talk about politics or the media, this is why you need to learn boundaries. It is very easy to cross someone's boundaries and get in trouble in the blink of an eye. This could happen frequently if you only have one opinion from one source or person. Nothing good will ever come out of having one opinion, or even no opinion. If someone has a missing leg and has crutches, do not ask them about it, that could be a sensitive time in their lives and they may not feel comfortable talking to you about it. If they bring it up, then have at it, you just have to be vigilant and smart with these types of things. Try to avoid boundary crossing as much as possible. In Conclusion, when it comes to communication and big events in your life, learning different opinions from different sources can be very useful in your life and should be used fluently in life. You never know if it will help you if you don't try. If you use this skill frequently, you don't know how many people you will make happy. The fact that it will help you make the right decisions, and make you successful, definitely would make me want to learn and adapt to different opinions. If you are prepared and know how to use this, the outcome of the deisions you make will be outstanding."
25558,0,"Have your ever been trying to make a big life decision and you don't know what to do? So you ask your friends and they help you with all of their ideas. When trying to make a big decision it is better to ask more then one person. asking more people is helpful because it helps you make better choices,it gives you people different ideas or opinions,and it gives you the best choice or decision. Asking more people gives you better choices. while your making a big life choice you don't want people to give you bad ideas so when you ask multiple people there will be ideas that are good and can help you. My sister is trying to decide on what college she wants to go to while she was looking she would ask people what college do they think is best for her and someone said a college that she really liked and she found the right college. When it comes to a choice yo need the best feedback, so when your asking you ask more people because it is better feedback on the choice your going to make. I was trying to make a choice on what to do this weekend so I asked my family and they helped me come up with something fun to do this weekend. Making a good choice is hard without any help or feedback but when you work with others to make a choice it is much easier and very helpful. When you are born people start to think of names for you and its hard sometimes so they all come together and help your parents out to come up with the name you have today. Having help with your choices is better then by yourself because it makes for better decisions and choices. Give you different ideas or opinions. Coming up with an idea can be difficult without other peoples help and ideas with different ideas it can help you in many different situations. I was doing a project and i needed some help because it was hard to do alone without other peoples opinions which I needed to do the project so when my brother helped me out I go to get his side or opinion on how my project should be done. Different peoples choices or opinions is very helpful in the society we have now because if we listen just to one person it will put an image in our heads and it wont help us down. When I was talking to my mom about what I thought about the society we are in I said somethings and my mom gave me her different opinion on what I said and it opened my eyes and gave me a new and different opinion. When it comes to ideas and opinions it helps to have more then one because having more then one can help you in many ways in your life. I went to a conference in Generic_City and I had this idea of what it was going to be like,but I was surprised by it because there were many different opinions and ideas. Different ideas and opinions is all your gonna see in life and learning how to use and see them is very helpful in your future. Gives a new perspective. Perspective has to do a lot with getting ideas or opinions and when you get a different perspective on something it is very helpful and can open your eyes to something new and different. I was at an event with my family and we listed to different people speak and we got a lot of different opinions and different perspectives on thing and it was a very good learning experience. When trying to get a new perspective on something it takes more then one person it takes multiple people to get a good perspective on something important. I had to do an interview on one of my teachers and I asked her what she thinks about our president and she gave me a whole new perspective on how politics work and how I should look at it. Ideas dont just come from you it comes from the things you see or the people you talk to and what you have experienced in your day to day life in those experiences you have learned and have seen different perspective. When I went to Generic_City I saw a lot of different things like how diverse it is over there like how people express themselves and how there are so many different perspectives on the world we live in now,politics,and all sorts of things that are really eye opening. Learning about perspective is very important in your life right now and when you learn about it it will help you become successful. Why is it better to have multiple opinions when it comes to making a choice? It means better choices,different ideas and opinions and it gives you and new and different perspective. When using these in your life you need to be able to hear anything and everything and learn and be succeed."

1963,0,"""Resent studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"". Not having a car is such a great opportunity! It allows you to get a great excercise on your way to work, And everyone is wanting to participate in so many events that lead to Car-free day and many more. Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, Columbia. Millions of Civilions were in on this exciting event that started in the 1990's. All Colombians either hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work. The streets of Bogota was a traffic free place for a whole day! ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating"" Said Antanas Mockus, the mayor of Bogota. People are still riding there bikes and more to work because they feel like everyone should participate and don't think that alittle rain should stop it. But after, for the first time more colombian cities joined in on this day to start a new tradition. According to the Mayor, the day without cars has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any latin city. I think more countries should participate in this event, just because you are limiting yourself to how much you use your car and it seems like it would be alot of fun and is honestly such a great opportunity for you and everyone around you trying to make a diffrence. ""Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses"". This is actually very surprising knowing that America is and has been one of the world's prime car cultures. ""They are not interested"", Said a mom of two children that are 19 and 21. She said, ""even though they both live in places where one could come in handy....but it's not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take a public transportation or car-pool with friends."" To me I think these adults are making a statment. That you do not always have to have a car, and you most definatly do not have to have a licence to get you places. These teenagers are saving their money not having to worry about gas prices and car payments. Instead they are not wasting their money by walking and car-pooling to their jobs. It might take some time walking but you still get there. In conclucion, I feel like getting to places with cars is fast, and I know most people agree with me...but why not just once in a couple of days just drop your keys and ride your bike or walk to work. Limit how much you use your car. I promise you you will see a difference in your life."
18541,0,"The way technology has changed through out the years amazes many. However, a car that can do the jobs of a human? Now that is just terrifying. The development of driverless cars enforces dependence, not safe, and is not fully developed to be driving without a human behind the wheel. Nowadays, people are already frustrated by having to drive the car themselves but if you throw in a driverless car in to the mix? That is not safe for the people inside and/or outside the car. As the passage states, ""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times."" Also, what if the car is in ""driverless mode"" and begins to glitch, what is going to happen then? Or, the aftermath of a car accident and someone gets hurt, who is to blame then? Usually, when people in their adolescence get a car they are thrilled because it is their responsibility to drive that car safely and to be independent. However, with buying a driverless car, all the independence and responsibilty just flies away. In the future, what is going to happen when people feel that way since the car is driving, they do not have to do anything behind the wheel. Or, if someone falls asleep and does not hear, see, or feel the warnings and signals from the car to take control, For example, when the driver's seat starts to vibrate or the flashing lights on the windshield. A car that is driverless is quite impressive, but then what is the point of having a human behind the wheel. People who are for the development of these types of cars do not get the whole idea behind the problem with these cars. The passage states, ""-the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" Big whoop, throughout the years a human's attention spand has sky rocketed downwards. So, even if there was a warning, there would not be a big chance if the driver even saw or heard it. In conclusion, the development of driverless cars enforces independece, not safe, and is not fully developed to be driving without a human behind the wheel. If we stop this development now, we can stop the risks of what is yet to come in the future on the road."
15475,0,dear principal it think that it is not fair the way that you are not letting all of us students not participate in all the sports here in SCHOOL_NAME only if you have b average you may play.please if you let us play the sports without a b average not all of us are perfect at what we are. plus if you don't let other kids play sports without a b average it will be total chaos if you don't let us students will not try there best to put in effort in to there grade.there fore if you do decide to let other children with different grade average they may pick up there grade if you allow them to play there sports. there personality may change and start acting right and then all of the kids would have a b average and you'll be so proud of your school and how much effort the put into there school work and the way they act who knows they might even mature. in conclusion that is why i think that you may want to rethink about the rule on sports that you want to pass I hope you don't want to pass this new policy because your doing something that the children of SCHOOL_NAME would not appreciate because sports are a big part of SCHOOL_NAME and for you just to make a decision like that is hurtful to the kids who play sports here in SCHOOL_NAME
15311,0,"Do you want to be stressed out because you're trying to focus on two things? Not me! I would not be able to sleep at night. If you raise the bar to play sports to a B grade average, almost half of the school will not be playing sports. Also I don't think that's a good idea because a student is bound to start lacking in school or sports. I'm sure that you don't want to have a school full of kids that are going to get stressed out because they're trying to focus on school when really he or she is supposed to be practicing for a sport. Just think about it for a moment. You would be hurting many students dreams of becoming a famous sport player, but they can't because they did not have enough time as a child to practice. For instance, say their is a kid that is very talented in sports and has a strong chance of getting a scholarship. But the student grades are average. Sadly, the student does not have a B average and can't participate in the sport that he wants to play. Now you would've ruined his chance of ever becoming a famous sport star. Lastly, students will not be able to have fun in school. If you want a B grade point average you must work hard. That means sleepless night of studying. Do you want you're students to come to school dragging and falling asleep in class because they had practice and a lot of studying to do. But see why this could an good idea. For example, it may be a student that is a talented sport player, but all he want is a C grade point average so that he could play sports. This means that student will not be trying as hard as he should. What you should is when a sport season is about to start, go to all the students teacher and see how much effort the student gives. That ladies and gentlemen would be a good idea."
12166,0,"Three pictures were taken of this odd feature on the land of Mars. The reasoning for the interest of the pictures is because they think the figure of the shape is a face. The first time they saw it they were astonished and had many questions that they sent other spacecrafts to take pictures two other different times. I believe that the ""Face on Mars"" is just a natural formed mound and scientist need to stop listening to theories. One reason to stop looking for a civilization is because it is not important. Mars Global Surveyor even said that finding the face is hard work itself because we dont even pass over the Face very often. We don't need to wasting our time on something that is not going to affect us here on Earth. Also, after the discovery and the first picture was taken it was just a landform not an alien momument that some people predicted or hoped to be. Second, if you look at the pictures you see a difference in all three of them. If there was an ancient civilization wouldn't you think the pictures would be more extravagent each time after the first. What we see is the complete opposite of what was just explained. As each picture gets newer the face looks much more deteriorated than before. They face is practically gone by the third picture and there is nothing really of it to say that it was a face. Lastly, Even if there were airplanes or Egyptian-style pyramids or things smaller you could see them from the cameras. So don't you think that if there were people on the planet you would also see them as well in the other three photos. I can see where some people might be interested in the idea of there being people on another planet. It would be awesome to know that you could or can survive on another planet knowing if something happens to the one we are on now. We could even add more information on alien research NASA has been doing. In conclusion, the Face did turn out to be a mesa and or butte. The same thing as a mesa but a lava dome and just maybe happened to be the same height as the Face on Mars. Also, the pictures you could tell it wasn't a face the dome shaped thing didn't match the features of the far away picture of the Face."
796,0,"Phones and driving Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. Cell phones are the leading factors that cause accidents. In the most part of United States is illegal use your phone while driving including in georgia, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. People should not use their cell phones while driving because there is a higher risk of cause an accident. Texting and driving appear to be significant problem especially between younger drivers that are so affected with the using of cell phones and been on the social media. Distracted drivers can increase the possibility of accidents. For an example even a two seconds of distraction, taking your eyes off the road and pick up your cell phone to see who's calling, increases your risk of crashing. Its illegal in the some part of united states and also in some other places around the world due to that is a major reason why people get into accidents. People die because the drivers are on their phones while driving. That's why in georgia the leading cause to distracted driving is phones thats why this law came out "" hands-free"" making illegal use your phone while driving. Opponents say that hands-free set is safety because people can drive using two hands. However, hands free does not eliminate the risk of causing an accident. Some People don't follow the rules or laws it seems like they don't care or take it serious but this law was made it especially for you the drivers to protect yourself and others. Cell phones should be banned while driving because they are causing lot of car accident. Banning cellphones while driving will allow driving to keep a safe distance from accidents. One cannot focus fully on the road and the other vehicle, if one keeps talking on the consistently while driving. Using cell phones while driving should be banned completely for the safety of everyone on the road. It does not matter how good are you at multitasking, it should be forbidden and against the law. In conclusion, cell phones are dispensable tools that we cannot live without, but we should avoid abusing them need to use it responsibly. Concluding, if people don't give up cell phones the number of fatalities on the road will still increase. It is every drivers responsibility to protect their own and others people lives."
13091,0,"The face of Mars was not created by Aliens. It just happens to be a natural landform that resembles a human face. Although it has human features like the head, eyes, nose, and mouth, it is actually shadows that give it that illusion. The fact that it resembles a human head is a coincidence. If you use new high resloution images and 3D altimetry, you could see it for what it really is. In addition, it has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and a haunted grocery store checkout line for 25 years. The fact that it has become a pop icon proves that many people have believed that the Face was concrete evidence that life had or have existed on Mars. Some people even believe that there is evidence NASA would rather hide, like conspiracy theorists, but meanwhile this all happening defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars which further proves that there is no ancient civilization on Mars. Furthermore, Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos, but when it appeared on a JPL website, it revealed to be only a natural landform. This helps prove that there never was an alien momument in the first place. Although, not everybody was satisfied with this fact. They thought that perhaps that alien markings were hidden by the wispy clouds. In Malin's team's second look, they captured an extraordinary photo, but what the picture actually showed was the Martian equivalent of a mesa. So in the end, there was no ancient civilization on Mars, no ancient momument, and the Face turned out to be only a mesa. Although many people still argue about life on Mars, there isn't enough research for it to be proven true or otherwise. The fact that the Face was mistaken was because people couldn't see it for what it truly was in the photo."

How United States choose good presidents? First, we are going to talk about the curius case in the U.S.A talking about the political and how U.S.A choose the future president. There's alot of curios case in the U.S.A. For example, it's said clearly in the article that for first time in the story of U.S.A there's 2 represents to be president that came from the state of Hawaii in 1960, and those represent was against Jhon F. Kennedy. Or the other case that the Electoral system in those times it was very confused and for each state it represents 1 vote so The legendary John Kerry wins 34 democratics votes. There was alot of controversy. But with all those problems, how those U.S.A choose good there presidents? The goverment like there citizen have clearly 5 things (according the article wrote by Richard A. Posner) That are: ''Certainty of Outcome'' That is selecting a president that ougth to be who most votes receives is the winner. ''Everyone's President'' Means that is a resulr by a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president.''Swing State'' Is a method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates.''Big States'' Is a large state that gets more attention from presidentail candidates in a campaign than small state does.. And the last one is ''Avoid Run'off Elections'' That it could be argued method selecting the president may turn off by potential voters. In my opinion, i'm pro with. Is a very nice Goverment and Can helps every country in the world becouse there potential economic that they have."

If we don't help the earth who is? Everyday people uses cars to go to work and buses to bring your kids to school but all the smoke gets stuck in the earth and makes it hotter then it needs to be. If we recycle it helps the earth very much. Many people throw away plastic bottle water and that goes to our lakes, rivers, and oceans. People drink bottle water so much that put them together and it goes around the earth. If we keep doing little by little we can make earth a better place to live for us and animals. If we don't do nothing now very soon there would be no earth or humans. When you think about it its very important to do something. They're many little every day things you can do to help like car pool with friends, recycle, and save energy. The world is a very special place that we need to take care of. Like a mother takes care of her baby we need to do the same with the earth. We all need to do something to make a change. We have to reuse, renew, and recycle. All the things that look little makes a huge change in the world. So I do think students should help the earth by doing community service."

I think it would be a good idea to give us elementary kids that are not doing very good in school so we can tutor them and show them how to do their work.

We need our phones to protect us and to help us in school and in our classes. Another reason is if we have phones we can write a summary on our phones so we wont waste paper. If we could use our phones in lunch then we could chat with our parents about what our homework is about.

16537,0,"Dear Principal, All or most of the students like to be involved in a lot of things and do something that they enjoy doing or like to do. I think that the students with average of a grade C should be able to participate in sport and other activities. Students with grade C should be able to participate in sport and activities, because C is not bad of a grade! It is still considered as a passing grade in all the grades. If most of the students have a grade C as an average and they wouldn't be able to participate in sports or activities, then there will be almost no students involved in anything! I think that activities are not the distraction for students not to study very well to get a B, it is most likely they don't want to or just spend time doing something else out of school. If the students wouldn't be able to participate in school sports or activities they are more likely to go and do things out of school, and be involved in something else as well. All the kids like different activities and I think that they should have an opportunity not just study everyday, but also have some fun and do different things to prepare them for their future. When a student would only be allowed to study and not to participate in anything else they wouldn't have any time to have a break or to relax from a long day that they had in school. Students participating in sports and activities helps them take down the stress that they might of had in school, with friends or in a family, by doing sports or being involved in other activities and being able to communicate with others. That takes their mind of something that had bothered them. Therefore, I think that students with an average of a grade C should be able to participate in sports and activities. To have fun with friends and doing things they like. Also, taking the stress down and having something else to do out of school."
7223,0,"I agree that students should participate in extracurricular activities because, sometimes kids go home and have nothing to do and just sit around the rest of the day after coming home from school. Secondly, there is a vast number of students that dont participate in any activities at all. Doing sports and other activities could probably help some students a lot. You can hang out with friends while doing these activities which can make the activity more fun. Lastly, Everyone is always mostly on there phone so they dont do anything productive. Most of the time when kids get home they just lay around the rest of the day. Which is very boring, and not fun at all. Doing an extracurricular activity can stop you from being bored the rest of the day. When some students are bored they eat junk food, which is not healthy at all. Thats why some parents shouldn't let there child sit around all day. This happens very often where kids gain a lot of weight just from being bored. This can lead to a lot of health problems and i dont think anyone wants that for there kid. Nobody would want to see their kid really sick When doing these activities you can ask a friend to join you if they are not in any activities either. Asking a friend to join can probably make you enjoy the activity more. Maybe you might think the activity is boring and would be better enjoyed if a friend joined you so you can have someone to talk to. Having no one to talk to makes it boring and makes you want to quit. You can also meet new people and make new friends with the people that are also in these activities. So inviting a friend who isn't in any activities could probably help them too. Everyone is always on their phone and they really care about these activities. Sometimes students are more worried about playing a game on there phone or TVs when they get home. Thats these are even relevant for them. Additionally, They should talk about it more often in schools so the kids will see just staying home and doi9ng nothing isn't healthy and they at least should do sports or something productive. And being in front of a screen all day can damage your eyes. I don't blame them because being on your phone is basically like an addiction. Since there is so much to do on your phone instaed of actually going outside and doing things. In conclusion, Being in a extracurricular activity could probably help improve your grades, your social skills, and your performance in school overall. It may even help improve some people grades, because a lot of people werent really focused on this type of stuff but joining an activity may help. It can help with boredom if students have nothing to do at home. It can also give them some fresh air if students are doing sports because they are technically cramped in a classroom and get stuck in busy hallways the whole day. So i agree that joining a extracurricular activity would be a good impact on school life."
15929,0,"Dear Principal, You said that the students couldn't participate in sports unless they have a B average, I would just like to say that that's a bad idea because students have so much homework and other stuff they have to do outside of school. That with sports and keeping a B average, that's a lot of work for one person. And on top of that the sports practise after school then school projects. Students will not have time to keep a B average because all the work they have to do. So for every kid and parent that wants to participate in sports, please change this school policy back, it would be a lot easier to the parents to because they work and have to clean all the time they don't have time to do all that. So please change the school policy back to having a C average or you wont have that much people on the sports teams, it would be a lot less stressful to everybody if you just changed it back. And if you want kids to play sports and represent the school. Thank you for your time to read this letter, i hope that you change your mind. Sincerely: Your Student STUDENT_NAME"
10761,0,"Facial Action Coding System could potentially be valuable in the classroom. For students with autism or some other form of mental disease, picking up on certain emotions and being able to tell how people are feeling does not come quite as easy as it does for other people. For them to have some sort of technology to help them learn how to tell what people are feeling could be a fantastic use of our worlds rapid technological advances. To use this technology on students computers in order to tell how they are feeling and what confuses them or what they understand is a different story. In some ways, this could be a good thing because it would notify teachers when their students simply are not understanding a topic. But it also seems like a slight invasion of privacy and it seems that some people would not enjoy software that could detect your face and facial features at all times. Our world has been making huge technological advances for awhile now. In just 40 years we went from the computer game Pong to having Virtual Reality. This kind of technological advance would be big but quite frankly not so shocking. Software that makes a 3-D model of your face and calculates your muscle movement in order to detect emotion is somewhat terrifying in the sense that a computer can now detect how you feel, but in some situations this technology could be useful."
19760,0,"Dear,Senator I think we should in take concideration in the next few years about changing are election to popular vote. I feel that are state would benefit in a positive way with the way that popular vote is set up. looking at the past history the electoral college is not benefiting us in a positive direction. i qutoe this from the article ""over 60 percent of voters would pefer a direct election""with that being said lets look at the cons of the electoral college. To begin with the electoral college system the people like me dont get to vote for president i have to vote for someone else to vote for me in that i feel like my vote doesnt count because what happens if i vote for a elector and he doesnt go for my person to win. That just makes me feel dumb then if the elector does vote for the same person asme its not really even final becuase that vote doesnt go towards the president it goes toward the state elector and its basically there choice. another con in the electoral college system is that the same fiasco in 2000 will break out again. were the legislatures are responsible for picking electors and they dont take in to concideration of other people votes. the con that could mostly impact america is a tie in the electoral vote. another reason the electoral college is an stupid way to vote is that the big states get better privelges than the smaller states they out rule the smaller states. Its final the electoral college is unfair outdatedand irrational. the only reasons the electoral college is alive now is the cetainty outcome,everystates president,swing states,runoff elections.run off electionsn means basically there will never be a blow out in the voting polls it will always be compitive with that being said with the presidents trying to run for president the will actually try to reach the peoples needs to meet there satisfactory. the swing states is sayiong that there one state isnt going to decide the whole election."
15727,0,"Dear Principal, Many student in this school are in school sport because many of them may be able to do better on sport then other subject such as math, reading and writing or science and so on other subject in school. Student may have the only chance to go to college getting a scholarship in sport to graduate in college getting a good job in the future. Many be as close to a B average as they can get and still not be participating in sports because they did not make a B average in the school subject they may have miss some school day and fell behind and did not turn in the work but still what to participate in the sport or other after school activities because of what happen in losing a couple class work. Maybe take time off practice of sport or activities and take them out to do there class work. Many student will improve there grade just to be sport or there after school activities because they like the field trips they get to go with there friend or team to win games to travel different places and try new thing. they made decide to go to college to get a scholarship in sport or other school activities that allow them to win a scholarship in a college they may not the resource to pay to go to college and winning a sport or school activities in a scholarship and this maybe this be the only way to there to then improve there life style getting s good job when there adults. They may set explain for other in life."
7445,0,"When you were a child do you remember when your parents would force you to play a sport, hangout with someone you didn't like, or make you do anything you did not want to do? It would feel like a chore not like a fun activity, even when it was meant to be fun. This would be the same concept if we forced students to do a extracurricular. I disagree with making it required to do a extracurricular activity because it should be the students choice, the teams would suffer, and some students don't have the time. It should be the students choice if they want to participate in a after school activity. Just like it is a students choice in what they wear, who their friends with, and what they choose to eat. Extracurricular activities are extra it even says it in the name, they are not required and should not be required. If everyone had to participate in an extracurricular then a lot of kids would be stuck in something they don't have a passion in. In even worse cases some students who have no interest in basketball but a huge passion in theater, would be stuck on the basketball team and not in the school play because all the spots would be filled. The teams overall performance would suffer greatly. Any kid who you force to do something they do not want to do will not try. This will leave lots of people not trying their best on teams and would cause lots of games to be lost, or a less amazing final product. Sports teams would have lots of players who are not good. Tryouts happen for this reason, so that only the best makes the team. This may sound bad but it is best and also gives students motivation if they do not make the team they want. Getting cut from a team growing up can also teach a valuebul life lesson that you have to work for what you want and sometimes you will fail but to always get up and try better next time. Sports are not the only example where this can occur. In plays or debate teams you would have lots of kids who are not outgoing so they wouldn't want to try. Some parents and kids simply do not have the time. A lot of parents work late and would not be able to pick up there kids which would cause schools to be open really late. There are kids who are in very difficult classes and need all their after school time to do homework and study, kids who also are on other sports teams that require them to be very punctual, and unfortunately there are students that need to watch after their own siblings when they get home. Do not make kids feel like they have to do something. Forcing extracurricular activities is not the principals choice, would effect teams performances, and create issues with time. You can not forget this would also be adding a lot more stress. Students already worry about due dates and upcoming tests that adding another set of this would increase anxiety and maybe even depression. So let students choose if they participate in extracurricular activities."
14589,0,"Dear TEACHER_NAME, January 26th, 2011 I believe that you should make community service required in our school. You should make community service required because it shows kids to be thankful for what they have, makes them get into real life situations, and a kid can't take one hour a week to help in their community? Community service makes kids think different in every day situations like should i bully some kid that has no parents or should i give him a complement? When i downtown to the animal shelter to volunteer i feel good and thankful for what i have. I feel that if kids do community service it shows them ""wow i have a lot, thanks mom and dad!"" kids fight with people everyday over what they wear, how they look, what they say. We are all lucky if we can walk, have a roof over our heads, have someone their to support you, have clean water. People across the world can afford food everyday. Here in America we should be thankful for what we have! When we are older we are going to deal with getting a house, buying food, making money; real life things. If we don't know what is ahead we are not going to know how to handle things. If we can just help out in our community like real young adults we are going to have a better way of living to know what happens ahead of childhood. If you are a kid you play games, computer, and watch Television some people can't even afford a television. If we can't use one hour a week to go and help our community and sit down and sleep, that's bad! we have hours and hours of saying I'm bored. Well go help the community! In America we can be better people everyday, why not make it better by making community service mandatory. I think if you want America to be a better place then it would really help to make Community service mandatory just to make people stop complaining. You are living that's all that matters, your trying your hardest to make life better. Maybe we should try to make some ones life better. Thanks, STUDENT_NAME"
20975,0,"Dear Principal, I believe that there are many reasons that both students should have phones in school and that they shouldn't. But really, the negatives to this issue outweigh the positives. So I think that your second policy of not allowing cell phones in school is the better choice. First, cell phones are a major distraction to learning. Even if they aren't supposed to have them in class, many kids still will. Texting will happen in all the classes. Also, when kid's are caught with their phones in school, I don't believe the rule will be clear enough to get them in any real trouble like they most likely should have been. A second problem to the idea of having cell phones in school is bullying and gossip. The problem has gotten so bad now in schools, that we learn about different types of it in class. It has definitely become a problem. So why add more fuel to that fire? Having cell phones during school would allow rumors and secrets to spread faster, bullies to find victims easier, and even the problem of bullying through technology would be greater. It's already a huge problem, it even has it's own name; Cyber bullying. Cyber bullying is becoming a huge problem. It has sent many teenagers to suicide. Kids say things over technology they would never say in real life, face to face. Sometimes they do this because they know how mean what they're saying is. Adding to the amount of things that these kids already endure everyday after school through computers, phones, and other communicating devices, letting them have cell phones during school would just make it much worse. I honestly can't think of why anyone would want that to happen to those kids. Looking from the side of those who think you should choose your first policy, they might say that it's best for the student's safety, in the case of an emergency or personal problem. Which is a good point, besides the fact that there are many phones in the school, most the teachers have cell phones of their own, and the office always has access to multiple phones. Even if every single phone is unavailable and all the teacher's cell phones have been gotten rid of somehow, it is very rare. So rare in fact, that I don't believe it to be an issue. Another thing they might say is that if kids are going to turn them off in class, there isn't a problem. Well, yes there is because most kids won't actually turn them off in class. If you give them a chance, most of them are going to take it. Having cell phones in locker rooms and bathrooms could lead to many horrible problems also. Things could be done with cell phones that could ruin someone's life forever. It's not good to even take that chance. I personally have seen something like that happen, and it does not end well for anyone. My point is that cell phones in school might seem fine, until something bad happens. There may be a few positive things about it, but many negatives. I hope you take this into consideration. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME"
11691,0,"Facial action coding sytsem should be used because it is a good way to help students and people, First off i think if this is being used on students it is a really good idea because some students be needing help and they are to scared to ask for help and in this way the computer can help and make the lesson easy for the students this might give the students moure confidence of doing something and trying. Also if a student is bored this will make the lesson not as boring as it is for the student. This is a good way to help people to what if they are going through something and they need help or want to talk to somebody but dont want to tell anybody the facial action coding can let somebody know and friends or family can take action. Plus it is cool because you can find out alot of things about old pictuers, Like if you want to find out or just see how somebody is feeling you can use that. This is really cool beacsue you can find out alot of feelings on just a picture. Lets talk about the Mona Lisa, they used this on her and found out how she was feeling in that painting. She was feeling happy for the most part but a little bit of other emotions with that. This is a really cool way to communicate with people, This is also a cool way to make movies and video games better and more reall felling you know.? This can sence 44 muscle in your face and will let you know how your felling just of your expression. We have expressions every day but sometimes can be hard to tell how we are feeling. Most people dont know how other people feel but this can let other people understand what they are going through. This can also let people track the emotion they want to know if that person is feeling. Yes i do think that this system should be used. It can help alot. This would be very useful in alot of things."
19314,0,"Dear senator, I belive that Electoral college is unfair in many ways, and maybe it would be good to keep the election by popular vote for the United States. The reasons why changing the election to Electoral college would be; smaller states would not see the candates because they would go to the bigger states like California, Texas and other states that are bigger then ohio or south carolina some of this states didn't even see a campaing ad how sad is that because this country is know for the equalness off every one but yet the electoral college forgets about seventeen states that are small because their vote doesn't matter.? Keeping the election by popular vote would be the best. The fact that the people of the United States are able to see and vote for whom they perfer not the electors who elect the president. You might think that keeping the electoral college election is not as bad or unfair because it can help elect a president when the one of the presidents vote are majotite of vote it can help a run off election but I beive the best way to select the president of the U.S would be by letting the people chosse what they think is the best so the people know they are noticed in this contry."
7358,0,"The principal should create a rule for each student, requiring that they participate in at least one extracurricular activity. With the number of clubs available for students to participate in there is no reason that each student shouldn't be able to find the activity that best suits them. If each student was to be part of a club at their school, they would be given access to pursue their hobbies with their classmates. This safe environment to pursue interests and hobbies would allow students to explore all kinds of activities and try to see which activities they would like to dedicate themselves too. By allowing students to figure out their interest they would be able to show off their uniqueness and add diversity to the school. There are various reasons to mandate one extracurricular activity and the principal should have no problem enacting this idea. One of the most vital reasons is the fact that this policy gives students a way to build on pre-existing passions. By enacting this policy of having each student participate in an extracurricular activity, each student is given an opportunity to explore any pre-exsisting passions that they have. If a student has had a passion ever since they were a little kid and know that they would like to join a club that builds on that, this policy would help do that. For example, if a student knew they wanted to be part of a club that helps them build on an interest of computer science they would be given the chance to join a club such as the Robotics team. They would be able to use their previous knowledge and joy for their topic, to elevate the team to greater success. If the school was able to bring a high number of dedicated students together to join clubs they would see vast improvements in the success of their activities. These students would be given even more motivation to join the club they love, bringing the best out of them and allow them to join clubs that they know they have interest in. Even though there are some students that know exactly what they want to do and want to dedicate all their time to one club, some students are not like that. Many students would like to explore various clubs and see which one is best for them, creating another reason to enact this policy. With this policy students who are unsure of what their true passion is, will be more inclined to find which club they like and dedicate themselves to that. Without this policy students who say they want to join clubs at their school are not motivated to act on what they said, instead choosing to go home and do nothing. Currently there are hundreds students in school that say they would like to join one of the various clubs offered, but find themselves simply riding the bus home and spending the rest of the day on their phone. This occurs due to a lack of motivation from anyone in school urging the students to join an extracurricular activity. Parents can only do so much for their kids when it comes to what their kids do in school, and some kids find ways to get out of joining any clubs. This is why schools need to put this policy in place to not allow their students talents go too waste. Not only would this policy help students explore interests they have, it would help everyone see how unique and diverse each person is. If each student was doing at least one after-school activity students will be able to show their uniqueness and collectively create a diverse learning experience for everyone at school. With every student participating in a club students would spread out amongst the various clubs offered at their school, creating groups of dedicated people who are trying to learn as much as possible to that topic. Currently schools face the problem of kids all gravitating towards the same clubs, such as Science Olympiad and Math Counts. If students don't get into these clubs or feel as though they aren't going to be able to do anything with these highly competitive clubs, they drop out and find themselves having nothing to do outside of school. Many students feel defeated and neglected after they don't do well in these clubs and find it hard to join any other club, for fear that the same tale may happen again. Because of this, hundreds of students intellectual abilities are being wasted. The current issue we face is a lack of students joining clubs after they are shunned away from another club, that is why we need the policy of at least one extracurricular activity per student. The problem we face with not having a policy of each student participating in at least one after-school activity, is that we have students who are immensely talented who are not motivated enough to be a part of a club. If the school was to have this policy every student would benefit from it as they are given a far greater reason to join a club. With the various advantages of creating this policy and minor drawbacks, each school should at least make an attempt to enact a policy that would not only help students but the school as a whole. With students having the added motivation to join the clubs offered at their schools, with the added diversity to the school, there is no reason a school should make an attempt to complete a policy like this. The principal at all schools should try to implement a policy that makes students participate in the after-school offerings that their school has."
8585,0,"Have you ever wondered what it would be like to explore a planet while fighting through the dangers the planet brings? What about a planet that at ground level, has far more extreme conditions than humans can handle? This is what exploring our planetary neighbor Venus would be like. Even though the author claims it would be worthy to make the dangerous trip to Venus, he does a poor job of supporting his claim. The author uses a credible source, NASA, but the author fails to back up why the pursuit is worthy. The information from NASA talks about possible solutions to the harsh conditions of Venus, but not about why the trip should be made, despite all the harsh factors. The text states, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape."" The author has valid reasoning for solutions, but this information does not mention why it would benefit us to risk lives just to make the adventure. The author also includes an abundance of information about how dangerous and risky Venus is, and yes it is important to know these facts, but in the beginning of the article, the author seems to scare the audience into not traveling to Venus. Paragraph 3 states, ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquify many metals."" The author goes into detail about just how deadly Venus would be to humans, instead, if he was trying to prove that it is a worthy point, the author should've been lighter about these facts and not gone into such scary, vivid detail; the author also could've added a counterargument in this paragraph instead of waiting until later in the essay to start showing what he was actually trying to prove. The author could've included more evidence to support his view, but he did provide one piece of sufficient evidence. Paragraph 4 reads, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" This piece shows that some scientists want to explore Venus for its ancient possible ability to explore life, but the author needed to support his claim with other information, other than strictly in this paragraph. Ultimately, the author did have evidence in his article, but there needed to be more in order to make his claim well-supported and also more credible. Exploring Venus may be a good idea, but the author's claim wasn't clear enough throughout the essay to be able understand his point. The only time the author's claim was clear was in the conclusion when he stated reasons why Venus should be explored. All in all, the author did a poor job of supporting his idea of the worthiness of traveling to Venus, despite all the dangers it brings with it."
11822,0,"I wouldnt use this Facial Action Coding System on students because it those enables computers to dentify humans emotions but not real ones, it just shows the human emmotions byt the expression but not the real emotion that the human is feelin, Mona Lisa's natural face might be like that but not because the Facial Action Coding System identified that she has several different emotions showing in that paint from Da Vinci means that she was for real feeling those emotions, I think that is just how her face is, because all the people in this planet have dufferent faces that we cant not even describe if they feeling this or that because there face is just like that, But sometimes its true the Facial Action Coding System might be true because Dr. Huang observed that Da Vinci has studied anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. Dr. Huang predicts that it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. I t says that the same technology can make computer animated faces more exoressive. I believe that the Facial Action Coding System works perfectly good and does indentify humans expression like Dr. Haung said but not real emotion becasue the person can just be expressing some emotions but that doesn't mean they feeeling it that way."
12130,0,"Was there a man on Mars? Magazines say yes, but the scientists have continuously said no. On May 24, 2001, NASA's ship, Viking 1, found something on Mars that had the facial features of a human. Scientists have proven that the piece of rock thought to resemble a human face is no more than just a natural landform through unusual shadows, facts that have been talked about with many scientists, and images taken that agreed with the facts. First of all, NASA stated that they thought this landform was just another mesa found on Mars. The difference was that this strange, possible mesa obtained humanly facial features. Later, the fact the that the ""facial features"" on the mesa were due solely to unusual shadows, which gave the untrue image look like eyes, nose, and a mouth. Next, the fact that the mesa is only a natural landform, not a face has been confirmed with countless scientists. On April 5, 1998, everyone was waiting to see what decision would be released about the mesa. Was it once a face of a person or just another landform on Mars? It appeared on the JPL website that there was no alien monument; it was just a nautral landform. Scientists have confirmed this. The only reason that it is even questioned is because people wanted to have been able to say that there was a face on Mars, even if it was proven otherwise. There is much more publicity for authors especially to say that there was a face on Mars. Unfortunately, scientists know the most in this situation, not authors. Lastly, scientists took pictures to prove their evidence. In September 1997, Global Surveyor took a photograph of the landform that was ten times better quality than the original Viking picture of the ""face"". People who are not scientists still disagreed, so NASA and other scientists continued to take images. By the time it was 2001, the mesa did not look like a face anymore. The picture shows that it is clearly just a mesa. In conclusion, people would be crazy to try to attempt to disagree with the scientists because of how many facts they have to prove their hypotheses. First, they explained why the mesa only looked like a face because of the illusinating shadows. Then, they confirmed it with other scientists. And lastly, the scientists took many photographs of the mesa that finally proved their point. Scientists proved their point by explaining unusual shadows, confirming information with additional scientists, and taking countless photographs of the mesa."
23195,0,"Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Not me! In my opinion students shouldn't have attend classes from home because for me is not necessary you know why? because most of the students should be preparing to put effort and go to the school. Now in today we have a lot of technology to learn more better about what you what to know. We have the school for learn more important things instead of to attend classes from home. Some ladies who get pregnant and then the baby is born has the opportunities to have classes from home because they can not lost their credits or to be absent during their diet that's mean that is a good way. First, the school would give you a more better choice instead of classes from home because many students should be lazy. For example students who take classes from home can eat whatever time they want and can study at the same time, they can go to the bathroom without any permission and when they want it but it's a problem because we the students have the energy and the capacity to go to school and learn more instead at home. Also we have more problems that some students don't understand and that's why they prefer attend classes from home. Furthermore they don't have any teacher who can help you, anybody who gave you any idea about to resolve a problem. You can not take things seriously and you have to work independently not as a group. Second, some students have many opportunities and doesn't make a good use, you have to appreciate what the school is offer you because them you still make the same mistake every day and if you want to grow up you have to make good choices. Every students have different thoughts about study some of them waste their time using their cellphones instead they can be study and it's bad because in a future they don't won. Students likes to put endanger their knowledge because they prefer to copy to somebody and not doing the difficult things by themselves. Third, parents have to put control on this because, if they don't emend their children's them when they go to school doesn't like because in school there are many rulers that the students should follow and if you are in home there don't exist any rule that can trust you and that's why some students are spoiled with the teachers. The school is for people who really want to studied. The students have to be always preparing because is the best way that you can be a great person in the life. If you put part of you in everything even so doesn't matter where you are if in the school or in your home, because when you want something you doing well and you have success in your life. In conclusion, students shouldn't benefit to have classes from home, is a worse idea that a student can have because this problem could have serious consequences in your life as a young you're. You students had to work striving for better opportunities. Classes from home doesn't help you so that's why you have to go to school and support yourself, if you want to be someone in the life, ""Don't be lazy, you can do it, be proud of who you are""."
15181,0,"Dear principle, I am writing this letter to tell you that i am against this new policy of at least having a B average to participate in any kind of sports. the reasons why is because kids need to have their fun. You shouldn't make that policy because you don't know if the kid will change once he is in sports. Sometimes a kid that does a lot of trouble and gets into sports changes because they don't concentrate on doing trouble. I'm going to explain my reason why this policy your doing is a wrong choice. My first reason was that kids should have fun. Why? because they get tired of school. Sometimes the teacher get on their nerves so they get into a sport were they can be relax and have fun without teacher making you do a lot of work and having to yell at you for stupid reasons. Sometimes its hard for i kid to do good in school when its boring. They have to be doing an activity and some classes are not like that so they fail it. Second reason was that you shouldn't make it because after kids go into a sport they start to change. If you don't give them a chance then you will not know if they have a chance to change at all. When i was in a sport my grades started to change i started to come to school every day and i would always say to my self "" i better do good if not my cosh is going to find out and he is going to make me do a lot of running"". That's why you should give them a chance. Last reason was that kid don't concentrate in doing any trouble when their in any type of sport. All kid concentrate is on doing good in your classes so they cant get in trouble in their sport. If their not in a sport they end up doing bad not caring about school and they just go to school for a waist of time. Instead let them have sport so it can be the other way around. So principle please let us have sports, don't make the policy its unfair to some kids cuase they have trouble learning. I just want to say that if you read this i hope you change your mind. I really want kids to be able to play sport with low grades"
18417,0,"How do you feel about driverless cars? Sergey Brin, Google cofounder, is working on a profect called ""The Google Car Project"". I personally think that with google cars a lot can go wrong. I believe that becuase it is easier to have car accidents, easy for the equipment to malfunction, and who would you sue if you were wrecked by a Google Car? First, with Google Cars people aren't controlling what is happening. Although there usually is a person in the car of a smart driving car, a lot of the time that driver is probably not paying attention to the road. Most smart driving cars have built in techneques that make it so that the person in the car has to at least have their hands on the wheel. For example, ""In 2013, BMW announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" The car can handle driving functions at speeds of up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" Second, with Google Cars it would be easier for a wreck if the car malfuntioned. It would be easier for the car to malfuntion becuase, for example, say you were in a Google Car and you got a warning that your break fluid was low, you wouldn't know becuase you weren't paying attention to your car. Also, they have made a sensor that goes on the roof of your car so that the car can see all around your car. If that sensor malfuntions, the car wouldn't be able to see where it was going and you could wreck. For example, ""The most important bit of technolofy in this system is the spinning sensor on the roof. Dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings."" Lastly, who would you sue if you were in a wreck and you or the car that hit you was a smart car? Would you sue the person driving, or the car manufacturer? Or say you were driving a smart car and you broke the law, drivers fault or manufacturer? These are very important questions. For example, ""Still, even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer? How do you feel about driverless cars? Sergey Brin, Google cofounder, is workng on a project called ""The Google Car Project"". I personally think that with Google Cars a lot can go wrong. I believe that because it's easier to have car accidents, easy for the equipment to malfuntion, and who would you sue if you were wrecked by a Google Car?"
16460,0,"""Hay Bob how were the try-outs for the basketball team?"" ""The coach said i could've made the team, Joe."" ""Why didn't you make it?' ""Because of my grades."" Too bad Bob couldn't make the team. He is so good in basketball but because of his C he can't be on the team. Now how does that sound principal? He has so much talent and could lead your school to their first championship ever, but he has a C. Bob could have either was missing his assignments because he was having some family problems at home, or just not getting enough sleep. Mostly everybody has a C at school so who's going to be on the team. Why allow students with C averages to participate in sports or other activities you ask? Students are not going to be on the top of their class everyday. Even an A students slips up eventually, and if that student is in a club or on a sports team then they will be kicked off. How does that sound an a student messes up one time and gets kicked out of a sports team or activities. In conlusion, a student with a C average doesn't mean that they are not smart. Maybe they are just struggling in one subject. When you allow kids with a C average to participate rthe sports team will win more. Having a C is what most students have anyway so why not allow it?"
6957,0,"My principal decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I agree with what my principal said about how we must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. The first benefit is students could be forced into something that they actually love. The second thing is students could be really good at something and just not know. And last is kids can get really lazy sometimes and making them do something can make their life a lot better. First, students could get forced into something they actually love. If a student decides to play a sport for their activity then they could end up really liking it. The students could end up playing that sport for the rest of their life. If they like that sport and keep playing then they could meet new friends. Overall, extracurricular activities can create great experiences. Second, Students could be really good at something and just not know. Is someone has never played a sport Then they dont know how good they could be at it. I have a friend that had never played basketball And when he first tried the sport it turns out hes good. Any person that tries a new sport could end up playing with the pros, all you have to do is just try the sport. In the end, being forced to do something could reveal a talent. Lastly, kids can get really lazy at times and by forcing them to do and extracurricular activity can change their life. For instance, if they have weight issues then you could sign them up for a sport so they can loose some of that weight. Also by making them do an activity it can change a persons view on a certain group of people and maybe make them want to do what those people do. By playing something as a kid can make that person as an adult have a stronger work ethic. In conclusion, doing extracurricular activities as a kid can help you as an adult. In conclusion, extracurricular activities can help find and create good things for you in life. My first example is students could get forced into something that they actually like. Second, kids can be very talented at something and just not know it. And lastly, kids can get really lazy and by forcing them to do these activities can make them into a new person. By making students do extracurricular activities you can help a lot of kids."
1784,0,"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage Imagine walking out into a world of smoke, dust, and fog; finding oranisms exstinct or hiding. This is a glimspe of our future. If we do not conrol car usage in our days today this is what it will come to. Limiting car usage has a plethora of advantages. In Vauban, Germany, past car owners have given up their veihicles for a better life. ""'When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' sad Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the clatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.""( ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elizabeth Rosenthal Paragraph 3 Lines 20 through 25). Many people have given up their cars and homes to move to this upscale communtity. It is an example of a trend to separate suburban life and auto use. There are efforts going on right now to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. Twelve percent of those emissions are from passenger cars and up to fifty percent in car-intensive areas in the United States. According to the article ""Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog"", Paris, France has enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city after days of a near-record pollution. People who were motorists or drove licensed cars were ordered to not drive or they were to pay a fine of $31(22-euro fine). This did not stop most of the people however, because four thousand drivers were find, and 27 of them had their cars impounded for how they reacted upon this. Paris typically has more smog. Having limited car usage enabled the congestion(car traffic) to go down 60 percent in Paris. Even though after this enforcement of the driving ban made delivery companies coplain of lost revenue, there were agreements for hybrids and cars carrying three or more passangers. Imagine walking outside to the fresh air while feeling a rose petal on a near-by bush and watching a squirell and blue jay up in the trees. The neighbors are getting on their bike to the lake across town. All is happy and clean. This was due to limiting car usage in not just Paris and Vauban, but everywhere."
10880,0,"Decoding teenage emotions and facial expressions proves difficult for adults, but now there is new technology to help those students learn more effectively. The help of Facial Action Coding brings new opportunities to the classroom with prospects of working lessons around what each individual student is feeling. The system would bring better learning to students easier with help of individualized teaching by recognizing when a student gets confused or unhappy with the lesson. A computer with this coding system in its hardware could change the way students learn and how teachers teach. The learning process would be more individualized, because the computer works around what makes that specific user smile. ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" The computer will ultimately pick what to show on the screen based on one's past reactions to previous stimuli. This system would help students understand a lesson by changing the way it teaches to help the student. It would no longer be one teacher teaching a lesson broadly, it would be one computer teaching a lesson that specifically helps the student. This would lead to more efficient learning and overall better test scores. The computer with Facial Action Coding System will turn a struggling student into a more efficient and educated student. The use of this technology would be effective by using accurate ways to study students' facial expressions. Developing an accurate system is the foundation of an accurate learning environment for students. The system is a facial expression expert; it knows when you are actually enjoying something or not through studying the specific muscles you use. ""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a 'smiling' politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" Each muscle holds a different purpose, and the Facial Action Coding System studies each one to pinpoint which emotion is being expressed. The developers of this product have studied greath lengths over this material, and suggest that da Vinci did the same. The accuracy of their product is based off of psychologists, professors, and doctors to get an accurate description of basic human expression and muscle movement. ""Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code."" Having an effective foundation to the software will lower the risk of inaccurate studies of facial expressions. To conclude, the Facial Action Coding System is an asset to classrooms everywhere. Struggling students can learn effectively without raising a finger; all they have to do is react as they normally would. The accuracy and development of this software helps read each student's individualized emotion such as confusion, boredom, or anger. The computer acts as an individualized instructor, acting on each emotion and reaction to new material."
20510,0,"Dear State Senator, I understand there has been some contreversy between keeping or changing the Electoral College by popular vote for the president of the United States, But We need to Keep the Electoral College, and these are the reasons why. First things first, the Electoral College is a process,not a place. Also it consists of 538 electors but a majority of electoral votes needs to be 270 votes in order to elect a president. So each Canident has a 50/50 chance of winning or losing. The elctors are chosen by the political parties, which i can see how people would have a problem with that,but if they dodnt choose the canadents for us we probably would even know which person to elect as a canadent. The presidental election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, giving the citizens more than enough time to decide if they are happy with the president they have or if they should elect a new one, usually there happy with the president they elected which means that the Electoral College process is working. Although the electorla college system is for the voters to vote for a slate of electors to elect the president the citizens still get a say in the election towards there president of choice. if the citizens could just elect a president from there personal votes then they would probably make the wrong decsion on who to choose, they might be fooled by the flashy ads on tv promising change when in reality, there promises are lies. Thats why having a slate of electors help to vote for a president if so important because they know how to point out there lies and know what there true intentions are. Some say that the Electoral College system is 'Unfair' to the people but i strongly disagree. Infact, the Electoral College helper the people choose the right president for our country"
17180,0,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"", there are aspects that suggest driveless cars are or could be both beneficial and a potential for harm. Combining reality with the article, I firmly believe driverless cars will be more harm than help. There are so many varied scenes and scenarios that are possible while driving; a person will never be fully aware of what scene could appear in the future. In the text, it is stated that ""Human drivers must remain alert"" (paragraph 7) suggesting that the ""driverless"" cars may not be programmed for EVERY possible scenario. The cars' reflexes may not be able to manage fast accidents or random incidents that can occur. What will the consequences be when the car isn't prepared and the human's attention is not in full focus on the road or the car? Starting after the first Industrial Revolution, the world began to rely on machines and other inventions to provide faster and less labor. As much as technology is honored, faults still have occured. The world has seen machines malfunction and cause injuries or even death. Machines can never be fully trusted, at any second a virus or unintentional happenings can cause a machine to disprogram. In movies, it has been common to base a horror story off of a malnfunctioned item. At any given time, these cars could malfunction and not do the correct thing. For example, the brakes could get locked up and the car could lose the ability to stop. Another possible occurence is the steering wheel could lock or get left and rights confused. A simple malfunction can cause a lot of damage. While the driverless cars improve and increase in function, humans' trust in these cars also increase. Humans will began to trust more in the cars' ability or drive, and slowly began to lose concentration while in these vehicles. Since technology is such a big role in society, people will focus more on their tablet and phone and let the cars' do all the work. People might not glance up for minutes at a time. If an scenario occured to fast and the car needed human help, the human may not be prepared. In the matter of seconds, we might not be able to react fast enough to get into proper position and get our minds focused on what is happening outside the car. Technology improves everyday. As said in the text, driverless cars have been an idea for a while; but not all ideas are good ideas. Today's society already relies on inventions for less labor, the last thing we need is a driverless car. The road is not always the safest place. The road is very mysterious and can cause many tragic consequences. Not everyone will use driverless cars, so there will be potential hazards with conflicting into regular cars. The world will be a better place if we stop worrying about how to be even lazier, and more about what has corrupted us."
1977,0,"There are many advantages throughout the world that would come from limiting car usage. Countries have been limiting and getting rid of cars and it has only ended up becoming a benifit. If we stop using cars so much we can avoid things that about to happen soon. For example, greenhouse gasses are going to run out, cars cause financial issues, and the more cars there are being used the more polution there will be in the world. Nowadays communities like Vauban are rising up all over the world. People have given up their cars to live i that community or bought a space towards the edge of the community to park their cars. About 70% of the community gave up their cars to live there, 50% sold their cars to live in Vaubans. People in Vauban were interviewed and some say they are much happier without a car because they were tense with one. In Europe the way of living like Vauban has spread in Europe as a trend. Stores are placed on main streatsd instead of malls so you can get there easily without a car. For a while there was a partial driving ban in Paris. Paris had smog as bad as the pollution in Beijing which is one of the most polluted cities in the world. About 4,000 drivers were fined and 27 were impounded for not complying with the temporary car ban. The people of France blamed Diesel fuel for the pollution as 67% of vehicles in France run on Diesel. The temporary bans on were erased when the smog was cleared a few days after. For three years Bogota, Columbia has dedicated a day to a day with no cars. In this day people can only use busses and taxis as a form of automobile transtoprtation. The goal is said to be to promote alternative methods of transportation and reduce smog. Violaters were charged with $25 fines. Later on, the cities Cali and Valledupar, joined the event. People got around walking, biking, and hiking. Limiting car uses can lead to better things. Less pollution is definitely one of the benefits of driving less due to the smog produced. People have been in better financial situations and have been living better lives because of it. We will soon be running resources so the less we use the resources we have, the more we will have for the future."
451,0,"Phones and Driving Everyday people die in car accident, but most of those accidents are caused by people on their cell phones. This here is one of the biggest issues the world faces every day with drivers getting their self's in danger and others over a phone call or text message. If you think the slight chance that any of this isn't important and the world is just making a big deal about this, will then let me give a hand and give you a lesson. In 2011s Cell Phone and Driving Statistics, it's estimated that 23% of all car accidents each year are cause by cell phones use. That's 1.3 million crashes and 10 % of those car crashes have been fatal to many others. Cause of these accidents many are wondering if people should or should not be allowed to use cell phones while driving. If we were to have a week that no one could use their phones for while driving that long the amount of car crashes and accidents could possible or will decrease by the hundreds. Know yes there still will be car crash happening but not by phones anymore, but we really can't do that cause some people aren't going to give up their phones while driving. But there is a better option one that's already being put in place in many states and counties and that laws. Yes, laws are already being test or being placed in many states banning phones while driving now, but they all have a different way of solving this problem. In some states the law only effects teens under 18 or 21 from using their phones when driving hoping to dramatically decrease the chance of car accidents where in other states they don't allow ant one to use their phones at all, for example California has a law that any one 18 or above are ban for using their phones on the roads or anywhere while their using a car, same goes for Hawaii as well. With these laws we can finally decrease the number of crashes, want some proof? In 2017 the U.S. Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced that highway fatality numbers are going down for two consecutive years, it even led in to the first six months of 2018. If we keep it up, we could have much saver highways and neighborhoods for the kids to play in."
1008,0,"Phone should not be used while driving on the road because you're putting yourself, others drivers at serious risk and you can get in trouble. That's why the law says know texting while driving because it wouldn't be safe. Well really you get a ticket but I think they people should go to jail because that's something can't pay around with like people get in bad car accidents because of people wanted to be hard headed and not following rules. Rules are helpfully especially when it's serious that that people should follow. That all about being safe and doing the right thing. If you don't want to follow them. Then you will have to face the consequence and learn from them. People may make mistakes but when you're on the phone or texting and you get in a car accident, someone dies from it. That something you can't really take back. Then you would really want to go back and change things for the better. But you can't. Just imagine you lose someone because of that person was on their phone and not pay attention, you would want to know why just wait wouldn't till their done driving. You would of have been very much be upset. I think that drivers should text and call before getting in the car. Its better and it would make more since if they do that. They can also leave their phone at home. At long they don't drive while texting and call other people knowing that they can get a ticket. It's not good to put other people at risk while driving you can hurt yourself, that person, or people that's in the car with you. Being safe is important and following the rules is also important too. That's why people should take thing like this serious and tell their children to put on a seat belt and also don't text and drive eat the same time. You never know what might happened to you and you may face some consequence."
2079,0,"Today, we depend on cars for transportation. We never consider walking or taking a bus until we realize it's our only option. As teenagers we use cars as a gateway to independence and freedom. Little do we know that there are many advantages to the limiting of car usage. Advantages to these limitations are it's better for the environmemnt, it provides a safer city, and it helps financially. Creating a better environment starts with the decisions we make. When we decide to take our cars for a 2 mile trip, that could be walked, we are polluting the air in our city. For example, source 2 explains that the air in Paris became highly polluted due to the overuse of automobiles. ""Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"". One day motorists with even-numbered plates would leave their cars home and the following day people with odd-numbered plates would do the same. This decreased the amount of congestion by sixty percent within five days. Source 1 states that cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to fifty percent in the United States. Source 3 states that in Bogota, Colombia, after their Day Without Cars, parks and sports centers flourished throughout the city and uneven sidewalks were repaved to make them more smooth and broad. The avoidance of car usage can improve our environment dramatically. Safety is a very important factor in our lives. Often times our safety is put at risk when we are in a car and we don't realize it. Without the use of cars, we wouldn't have to worry about car accidents, traffic jams, etc."
4480,0,"Some schools require students to do self-assigned projects over the summer to assure their continual learning over their break. These projects should be designed by teachers rather than by the students because students are not knowledgeable on the requirements of a good school projects and will likely misconstrue major information needed in future study. Students also have the power to manipulate their grade, perhaps giving them an unfair advantage over others and giving them a grade they don't deserve. When teachers assign projects and assignments to their students, they know what they're attempting to accomplish. They're aware of how the project will tie into later assignments and even the student's next year curriculum and standards. For example, in fifth grade, my sister was assigned a project to do over the summer in preparation for her sixth grade English class. Her teacher, Mr. Generic_Name, was aware of the type of assignments that might be handed to her come her first month of sixth grade. The assignment was to read and annotate a book, which Generic_Name, my sister, had never done before. This summer project helped gauge her understanding of skills she would need in the future. This project, which was designed by her teacher, helped her prepare for her first year of middle school because her teacher understood the curriculum requirements for her later years, rather than letting her and the rest of her class set themselves up for failure. For a teacher, grading projects and big assignments is a part of the job description. Some teachers grade hundreds of assignments a day, giving each student a thorough understanding of why they received the grade they did. Little assignments obviously need less attention than the bigger ones, the same way teacher-assigned projects would need less attention than the student-assigned ones. A teacher has to go through and grade every student-designed project individually, reading all the different instructions and understanding the different rubrics. To further my point, the time consumed on simply understanding the directions to those assignments would be dastardly. Once, my seventh grade math teacher mentioned to his class that he barely slept the night before a big field trip that he was chauffeuring because he was awake late at night grading his students' projects. Rather than letting a student decide their own work, their summer projects should be assigned by their teachers. Conversely, if a student were to design his or her own summer assignment, the grade they'd receive would likely be higher than if a teacher designed it. For instance, when I was a sophomore in high school, my English teacher, Ms. Generic_Name, gave her students a sheet of paper and a lecture. She told us that the only true way to learn was if we taught ourselves. She continued her lecture by telling us we had one month to design our own summer projects, and they'd be graded according to our own rubric next year, which would be written on the paper she gave us. Having the closed-minded attitude I did, I thought this assignment would be a waste of time, but it was the exact opposite. In the month that Ms. Generic_Name had left us, I learned more about my style of learning than I had all year. Scanning the room at the end of the month, every student came up with an original and creative project idea, and was excited to complete it. The next school year when we went to turn in our projects, my new English teacher told the class that the reason we had all gotten good grades for our projects was because we used our creativity to create our own projects, and that we'd all participated in the development of our own learning. For some schools, a requirement to insure learning over the summer is a summer assignment. The assignment could be designed by students or teacher, but teachers should be the ones to design their students' summer projects because they are more knowledgeable of the passing requirements and the the curriculum for their students' future study. Students should not be allowed to create their own rubrics or projects, because it will not teach them anything but how to pass according to their own set standards."
24267,0,"Many students face the issue of having a disability and do not get the help they need from their schools. This is clearly an issue as schools are not letting these students work to their full potential, and can lead to problems for the students later on in life such as; getting into college or getting a job. Allowing students with certain cases the choice to stay home and learn can be a great way to help them. Giving students with disabilities extra help does not make it unfair for other students; as those with disabilities do not have the natural advantage those students have. The category 'disability' does not just include learning disabilities, it includes those with mental illnesses and physical disabilities along with other medical issues. Attending classes from home would be a great way to help students who have learning disabilities. People with learning disabilities often need extra help and learning at home is a great way to give them that. Online schooling can provide students with the ability to work at their own pace and allows students to receive one on one assistance from their teachers without taking attention away from the rest of the class. Students can also take extra classes to help if needed without having to worry about taking too much time out of the school day. This can also provide care that makes the students feel no different from their classmates; which is what most students really want. Another way taking classes from home can benefit students is by helping those with mental illnesses. Most teenagers face the issue of having Anxiety, Depression, or ADHD, and being away from the school while still learning for a temporary amount of time might be a great way to resolve the stress school can cause for those students. Students often feel the most stress from other students, and being away from the crowded classrooms and halls can be a great way for the people to take a break. Having a mental illness can really impact how well the students can do in school. Stress, tiredness, and the in-ability to focus can all affect how well we can perform in school and in social situations, and all of these are some of the most common symptoms a mental illness. The final way that taking classes at home is for those with physical disabilities such as those in need of a wheel chair or in need of medical care. Allowing the students to stay at home for classes would allow the students to learn without the fear of disrupting the classroom. This would also take the stress away from parents and teachers of a medical emergency occurring at the school that they cannot help. The parents will be able to keep an eye on what goes on through out the day concerning their child. Having medications at school can also be a hassle; having to leave the classroom whenever you need them which causes a disruption to the lesson. Staying at home allows the student to take medications as needed without having to ask to go to the nurse first or, just sneaking medications in classes which can be a medical hazard. Though some people believe that allowing kids to stay home and do school work is not a great way to handle problems as they may become lazy and not do their work. Taking school classes at home will not benefit some people, though it can help those with different cases and should be available for those who need it. Not every student is the same and will have different needs for social situations and learning. Taking away a method that may help some just because it won't benefit all can damage those minorities chances to succeed."
16449,0,"Dear Principal, I am a fellow student who is against you for changing the school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average. A few reasons why is because if you did that then our school wouldn't be so fun. Another reason is because our students wouldn't be able to develop as much team working skills or they wouldn't be in to good health. My last reason is because it keeps kids off the streets and keeps them out of trouble. An example of my first reason is that if I were going to school I would actually want to have an activity or sport to look forward to. Instead of making the qualifying grade a B average it should be a C average. Then the students would have to get mandatory tutoring to help bring up their grades. They can go during lunch or recess so that it wont interfere with their activities or sports. Another example for my second reason is that by being in a sport or some kind of group activity it helps us develop good team work. It can also help out our school get more publicity for all of our good athletes and smart kids. And finally my example for my last reason. By being able to be in these activities it keeps kids out of trouble and off the streets. This can help out the community a lot and hopefully change their ways or bad habits. That way we can have better students. All in all these are my reasons of why you should not change the school policy so that students with a B average can't be in any sports or activities. I hope you take my views into consideration. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME"

As day by day passes, I believe that lots of students are sick of repeating the same dull sketchual, and wish they could stay at home for school, on the other hand, they will not have to wake up so early everyday when they worked on their homework till so late. When students attend classes from home, they will be able to manage their own sketchual, learn how to control their time efficiently, be more self-reliance, and prepare for the future. In conclusion, it is a benefit for students to attend classes from home, because they can learn how to make their own plan, and learn how to manage time, which I believe that it will help the students a lot in their jobs, future life goals or even their entire life."

For an example: My teacher sends homework online for us to do while we'll home; a majority of our classmates do not finish their work because of their lack of their attention span. Second, attending classes at home will cause you to stall because you don't want to do it. Example: A project was due in two days and I had not started on it yet, the cause of it was I kept telling my self I was going to do it later cause I wanted to do other stuff. A lot of students aren't responsible when it comes to picking and choosing what is important and what is not. Finally, parents or siblings can distract you from completing your work by needing you for something or messing you up on your work. School has less distraction because it's more of a controlled environment and more of a disciplined place."

Why don't we study things that no has ever studied before? Why don't we try to strive for more. The only reason why Pluto is not a planet no longer is cause we know there is more planets beyond. Venus is one of the things that we really have never studied. Even though the odds are greatly against humans with a extremely hot 800 degree surface, and much more we should try to create a space craft that could reach and survive the elements. Spend time in the lab, andtry to find a new material that could with stand the elements. We had flew to the moon hundreds of times, and circled the sun many times to. Expand the possiblities, and raise the bar on what the human raise can do. Challlenge ourselves, and expand dreams and knowledge. Make another planet possible if we ever do need to leave planet Earth!"

When i was seventeen and i joined the program. I did it for my country but then i found out that i can get pleasure from it too you get to take care of animals but if you are like me and used to taking care of animals you wont care about that. You should join the Seagoing Coboys program because you can see amazing things if you read the biography then you know that in paragraph 5 I saw an exavated castle in Crete on my way to China. You dont just sit there taking care of horses and other farm animals you also get to play games. I do other things too if you read paragraph 8 of the biography about me then you know that us cowboys found time to have fun on board. W e played baseball and volleyball games in empty holds. Sometimes we even played table-tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling and other games too. Im not saying thats its all fun and games because its not. One time I even broke my ribs while on the boat as you can see in paragraph 7. Boats will tip over,sink or they might even rock. That still doesnt stop you from atleast trying to make a difference. You can still make a difference for people. In conclusion being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than adventure it also opened up the world for me. You can also help other countries out that are doing worst than you or that are not doing good at all. As you can see in paragraph 9 that I am grateful for my opportunity to be a Seagoing Cowboy. By becoming a Seagoing Cowboy it made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs and because of that awareness my family hosted a number of international students and echange visitors for many years as you can see in paragraph 9 of my biography. Im saying all of this because i want you to join the Seagoing Cowboys program not only to have fun and go on adventures but to change peoples lives in other countries and to open up a new world for yourself."
4321,0,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during these long summer breaks. Students should have the ability to pick their own projects, because they can do a project over something that interests them and they would like to know more about. This could also want them to share an idea with there class that they find interesting this could be a good way to educate themselves and the other students. If students are aloud to pick the project that they would like to do,they could learn about something that they never knew before, this could make them want to find out more about it and research more and have more details for the project. If students are aloud to pick it they could educate themselves and make their mind run wild,it could also challenge the mind to keep on finding more details and more information so that they could have a good project. They wouldn't only educate themselves but it would teach the other classmates something new and make them pay more attention to the project and more kids will be awake for it and not want to fall asleep because its an interesting project. Kids have a big mind and if we let them do what they want for education they could amaze the teachers and make them want to give the kids more of these self reliable projects. Students would also have the ability to decorate there project and make it more appealing and more beautiful to look at and that would grab other kids attention. Some students don't always do the project that the teacher assign to them and most of the kids will not do it and fail, and that could make the kids not move onto the next grade. If teachers let students pick their own project over the summer most of the kids would do it, because they have a choice and the grades will rise and kids will move onto the next grade. They wouldn't only move onto the next grade they would also have a good bond with their parents, because the kids are stress free and have good grades. Some family's go on family vacation during the summer and some kids don't have time to finish the project, but if they had a choice they wouldn't have to rush, because they could always write over something they like and then they could also have some fun and enjoy there summer, and they don't have to rush and get the project done. Everyone has been there once when you got a project and its so hard that you can't think of something and your are sitting in front of your computer thinking about something to research on, this could cause you to have stress and make you angry, writing over something you like and find interesting could help you reduce stress and make you a happier pearson and the less stress you have the friendlier you will be. If the project was off of what the teacher would want us to write about it would be hard and it would challenge our mind to think beyond the boundaries and make us smarter and more intelligent. Teachers only want the best for their students so they pick the hard projects to make our minds grow so that we can be smarter and be ready for college. The projects that the teachers pick can be challenging but you can learn something interesting or maybe something new that you never even knew existed. Teachers are good people and they just want us to be successful in life. If teachers let students pick their own projects more kids will do it and there would be a good passing rate in the class, because students are not forced to do something that they hate they can let their minds run free and find something interesting to do their project on. There will be more information for the classmates to learn and the teacher may learn something that they haven't learned before. Students can reduce stress and enjoy the project that they are doing. Students have a wild and creative mind if teachers let them us it for education it will amaze them with all the knowledge that they have. let the students have a choice and let their minds run free like a bird."

By weighing the different units, the sofware can even identify mixed emotions."" It also gives examples of the what the pros are, such as ""a classroom computer coud recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" this was predicted by Dr. Huang. this would help many teachers figure out were exactly thier students are in thier classes and were they are confused just as the quote states. It even gives insight onto just how powrful the program is with ""They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one."" With all the teen suicides and pressure from work and such this could be really benaficial twards getting to the scource and asking if thry are alright.

1092,0,Phones & Driving Phones and driving are two bad combinations. They can lead to serious danger and harm. People must be careful on now they use their phones while driving as it can lead to major accidents or worse. I think drivers shouldn't be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Cell phones are major distraction when driving. People/drivers can't help but to pick them up and use them. This could keep the drivers focus off the main thing which would be paying attention to the road. In these cases it could potentially be dangerous as they could cause an accident. Next texting is also another reason why cell phones shouldn't be in the drivers capacity. Drivers often check their phones for messages or calls. This causes the driver to take his/her eyes off the road and cause an accident in a split second. The highest number of accidents come from texting and driving. This can is a major problem. Finally music is also a problem as most times the driver don't listen to the radio as they more than often listen to the bluetooth connected to the phone. The driver may not want to listen to a certain song and try to change it which would make him/her take their eyes off the road. It could also lead to them getting badly injured. In conclusion driving with phones is bad. We must try not to use phones as much as possible when driving it may save our lives as well as others. Doing this could also bring the accident percentage down. This could save thousands of lives maybe even more.
14272,0,"Dear Principal, I think that all students should be required to take part in community service. It is a great way to connect yourself with your community and help out others who are less fortunate than you or the environment. As an eighth grader, I take part in tutoring some of the younger sixth graders at my school. I think of this as community service because I do not get paid for these actions. Also, it is community service because I am helping some of the younger children at my school understand what they are learning better. Some students might not want to take part in the community service at first. They might be reluctant to try. After beginning the process, those certain students might realize that by taking part in community service, you can learn more about yourself as well as the environment and others around you. The students who at first did not want to take part in the community service, might come to realize that they enjoy helping others and from doing so, benefit personally. An issue with requiring all students to perform in community service is the time commitment. Some busy students might decide that community service is not worth their time when they could be doing things that directly benefit themselves. For example, they might rather spend time with their friends than spend time with children in a homeless shelter. I think it is important that you understand that these students might take more time to convince to take part in your community service than others. You should not simply tell them to do the community service because they are required to but you should explain to them why it is so important and you have decided to put emphasis on it. I think that it is important for everyone to take part in making this world a better place. Community service is one way to get people to contribute to that. Students should show that they have a say and have their own individual rights. By helping others or the environment around you, students can show that they can change this world, one little step at a time. Community service could be that first little step. I find it very important for all students to take part in community service some time in their life. I think by making it a requirement for the students that attend our school, everyone will find that community service helps to better understand yourself as well as others. It is a great opportunity that we should all take advantage of. Sincerely, Your student"
15034,0,"Dear TEACHER_NAME, I think that my school and I should be required to do community service. I also think it should be a choice for students to say whether or not they want to do it, like putting out a flyer or asking if they would like to help clean it up or something to that nature. The reason i think this way is because some students i know, including me does litter and don't think nothing of it, and its not a good thing. but then again we are 8th grade students and yes we know right from wrong but some students don't mature like others. And I know a lot of people that wouldn't help. But if u asked me I would be more than happy to help pick up around the community. Sometimes I pick up things and my friends ask me why I'm doing it, and it kind of offends me but i just roll with the roll. So that might be an reason why some students don't want to help out, because they think it is uncool or their to cool to be picking up litter after others. And i can come up with many more reasons why some student wouldn't help. But i have to stay positive. Well i do think that student should be required to pick up litter around the community, but my thinking has a limit."
25312,0,"When people talk to more than one person for advice, they usually seek a common denominator. A common denominator would be how random people have the same reason. Not only is it to see a common denominator, people would be able to make better decisions from looking at something with views gathered from peoples opinions. Say you were about to join the Navy. You would have great experience with water, like holding your breath underwater for a long time, going deep sea diving. You would also have to think about the risk you will be taking if you join. you become uncertain whether or not you should join, so you go survey fifty people if joining the Navy is a good idea. After the survey, you count who said yes, who said no, who was in between, and you look at there reasoning. some say to explore the world and see new things, some say it isn't worth the risk. the reason some people will find multiple views is to see whether something is worth it or not. When I make a tough decision, i want to know how it will affect me in the future and with others. If I had important, long work to do over the weekend after doing a lot of work on the weekdays, should I relax on Saturday only to rush through it on Sunday after church, or should I finish it on Saturday to relax on Sunday after church? Before doing it, I would weigh the good and bad things about my options. One of my examples will be mission seven in the recent Call of Duty: Modern Warfare game. In the mission, the player is sent to the embassy to retrieve the wolf, the main enemy in the game. you are sent against the Butcher, the right hand man of the wolf, who has brought militia warriors and the rioters. Now, the example I'm using isn't the player, but the rioters. At first, when I thought about it I was like,""I get the fact that the Butcher is after us, but why are there rioters? I get that the president did X,Y, and Z, but Jesus! I would've understood major protesting,not arming yourselves and banding together!"". In the Division, when the epidemic first started, most people had the same idea:Looting, Stealing, causing panic, arming yourselves,etc. In the Division 2, people were starting to think long term:Building communities, creating invention such as water purifiers, using solar power,etc. When the Division 2:Warlords of New York DLC cinematic trailer came out, it showed a random division agent going into a trading post. That trading post was a example of people trying to rebuild New York, and it's system. In conclusion, common denominators is the why a mass of people will do the same thing and what there reason behind it is."
24466,0,"Have you ever went to someone for advice? Did they give you good advice or bad advice? When someone is giving you their thoughts on the matter, it comes from their own experiences, so you must be extremely careful to not blindly trust someones advice. This is why many people go to a lot of reliable sources, like friends or family members, for advice. Seeking more than one persons judgment is amazing because everyone has their own opinions and experiences, it could lead to better judgment, and it could also grant you with some internal peace. These are the reasons I believe that seeking advice from others is a very good thing. When facing a hard decision, whether it may be a family or a friend issue, it is good to go to a couple of trusted adults or friends. This is a great idea because many people have different experiences and ideas. Lets say you want to go rock climbing, but without any gear. Some of your friends may say, ""Yeah! You should totally do it!"", or ""That sounds so cool!"". But what if the last person you go to made the same mistake you were about to do, and ended up getting very hurt. They would tell you to wear gear as to protect yourself because they don't want you to get hurt like they did. After hearing the last persons advice, you may start to reconsider your actions. Sometimes, people can give you bad and dangerous advice; however, many people also give good advice. So, if you just listen to one persons advice, you may find yourself in a sticky situation. While, sometimes listening to just one person can be good, you want to be able to have all the facts and all the opinions before diving head first into things. Secondly, after listening to others advice, you can usually come up with better judgment. What if you and your best friend get into a fight. Sometimes, all you want to do is fight, fight, fight. But, that is never the right thing to do. When you have some sound advice, you can usually talk things out. When you starting thinking with your brain and it's not just you using your mouth, you can have a better end result. Even if the fight wasn't good and you both are still a little upset, it is better than not being friends at all. With advice comes less drama and less hurt people. When you take a deep breath and use the advice given to you, it is easier to take a step back and apologize. Lastly, seeking advice from others can grant you internal peace. When someones comes up and helps you, you get a feeling of happiness. When you know someone is there for you and will stick beside you to give you advice, it boosts your moral. Also, when you are facing the problem head on, it can cause you to feel some uneasiness. So, if you have some great advice, you can usually feel more at ease. Finally, when the dilemma comes to an end, people will be proud of you for making the right decision. It feels great to know that you have made the right decision and that people will be proud of you. In conclusion, seeking more than one persons judgment is amazing because everyone has their own opinions and experiences, it could lead to better judgment, and it could also grant you with some internal peace. With all this knowledge you now have, you must make the decision for yourself to use said knowledge. So, will you go to others for advice, or will you just go off your own advice? The choice is yours."
23278,0,"This is what schools do not want parents to know. Kids attending a regular school waste time in every class they have, it could simply be waiting for another student who didnt complete the homework and had to catch up or a teacher waiting for students to quiet down. Even kids switching classes, at Generic_School we have seven minutes to get to our next class, thats almost thirty minutes of unavoidable time lost every day. Some kids who are seen as less popular at school see school as a extremely stressful place. There are also many upsides to going to a standard public or private school, the most important, the social situations. At school kids are forced to be in uncomfortable social situations from time to time, this is very helpful to get acclimated to all types of behavior before walking out in to the real world. Although Schools keeps kids social, online classes gives students freedom of learning speed, allows they to focus better and lets students learn in a more conferrable environment. The ability to take online classes from home gives kids freedom of learning speed. They can learn at their own pace, whether thats slower or faster than that pace at school, it would ensure that what they are learning has more of a lasting imprint in their memory. This would also give students the ability to take complete and fruitful notes. Its very common for teachers at standard schools to go through notes slides on PowerPoint was to quickly, only giving kids the chance to copy down the main ideas with very few details. This isnt all bad, it can lead students to understanding the bigger picture. The issue is that not all classes require students to know the bigger picture, more often than not, they are required to know many specific details and facts that may not have been copies down. Some may argue that teachers can post the notes on BlackBoard or Google Classroom, but this requires students to commit even more of their day to getting notes that should not have needed such a severe time commitment to acquire, also adding even more stress in to a students schedule. The most difficult aspect of school is struggling to keep up in one of a students more difficult class. This causes kids to feel stupid, and if they fall behind it causes them to feel even worse about themselves. Another huge advantage of online classes are that the students have an environment completely distraction free. It allows students to make the best use of their time. It could cut out so much time in fact they could end up ahead of what they would have been in a standard school. Also able to allow to students having more time to relax and sleep which is not very common in many highschoolers. Students knowing that the faster and more efficiently they work, they will be rewarded more free time is very motivating. Where many students at standard school just count down the minutes until the nest class until its finally time go home. They know that they wont get home any sooner of they work hard so they dont. Teachers may argue that students reward is a good grade, but nowadays a student can have average grades and still get into a good college if they simply do well on their SAT and ACT. By average grades I mean all A's, B's and possibly one C, but this is only if the students take honors or AP classes. If kids arent rewarded for their hard work they tend not to be committed to doing so. The final main advantage of taking classes online is that a student can learn in a completely conferrable stress free environment. Some kids who are seen as weird or 'unpopular' are bullied or looked down upon at standard school. This stresses kids out on top of the regular stresses of school this is over the top for some kids. Other students can also stress about how they look which shouldnt be relevant when trying to learn at school. All these unseen stress factors can build up within a student which is very distracting as well as can make them feel trapped. Therefore its important to many kids to learn in a conferrable safe environment. A non stressful environment makes students want to do their best and when students want to do there best they see just how smart they really are, causing them want to keep learning and excel. Their are many students who would benefit from taking online classes but other who are acclimated to a more social life would feel happier and more upbeat in a standard school. Even though having friends in all your classes can be very distracting, it makes those students more conferrable meaning those student would be better off attending standard school. Even through school prepares kids for the real social world online classes gives students freedom of learning speed, allows they to focus better and lets students learn in a more conferrable environment. Kids who feel overly stressed at school would greatly benefit from online classes were as others werent. I believe that it should be offered every where and kids would have the ability to pick but there should be a feature on the online schools website that allows you to talk to or communicate with other kids taking the same or similar online classes. This way there is still some social interaction for these kids. And they students doing online school should also be required to partner up with another online scholar to complete projects once a month. this way they still get some what of social interaction which is the one and only disadvantage of taking online classes. therefore the students will have the ability to learn at their own pace in a environment they are conferrable in with no distractions so that they can fully focus."

24246,0,"In my opinion it would benefit a students whom live by their own. The ones that came to this country by them self, the ones that must have to work full time or have two jobs, because they have job pay rent and others materials things that they must need every day to keep keep moving forward, as a result of working full time or having two jobs they would not have such enough time to attend any school. However if some school offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by access online without paying anything it will benefit a lot of students for example. The students would be able to work all day long without having any fear of getting up early in the morning to came to school, whenever they have time such after work at night they can access online a take the classes. In addition more students would get graduated thanks to this program if it came up. Students sometimes get out of school, even if they don't want to do it,but they have the responsibility of the bills that they have to pay every month. If program exits, it will be successful for students. As a result to this program teenagers from other countries would notice about this schools programs and they will have more reasons to be triumphant in having a better job. Unpleasantly they don't want to spend their hole life working at restaurants having they paid rate of $ 8.00 per hour, that's why this program will help students to create life's terms less stressful. They also will impact in a good way in the economy of the US. In summary this program would impetuous and righteous for the generosity that they're giving to the students and the opportunity to have a lifestyle more easily. This option will become a great step for every teenagers that came to this country looking for better education and success them self."
21835,0,"Dear TEACHER_NAME, TEACHER_NAME, I think you should consider policy one for lots of different reasons. Students should be allowed to use their phones during lunch periods and free times. Sometimes we have to call home and being able to have our phones out is a privilege that would help us and if we have our phone out in class that privilege can be taken. Sometimes I has those days where I leave something at home and it would be nice if i have times during the day when I can home. You have some kids that may not follow the class part and that's where where you got to be stricter in the classroom but it would help with teaching responsibility. Not to have our phones at all is just torture we sometimes have to let our parents know things and we cant do that's my opinion with this matter as long as it doesn't begin to interfere with education we should at least be able to have them after school. Thank you TEACHER_NAME for taking the time to read my letter. I hope you will consider policy one."
10964,0,"I think using the technology Facial Coding System won't work trying to find out how a person is feeling because how could you know what a person is feeling unless you ask them, now I know that a person might be able to tell how your feeling by looking at you, but now we don't use technology to tell how a person's feeling we just look at their facial expressions to tell if their happy, sad, mad, frustrated, or any emotion that their feeling I think we can only tell by looking at their facial expression, they said that by looking at the painting of Mona Lisa that they could tell that she was feeling 83 percent happy, 9 percent, disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 perent angry, now you would never know if she's happy, fearful, disgusted, or angry unless you were with her at that time of the picture you would never know how she's feeling. Thats probably how she takes all of her pictures you never know, she could have been feeling sad, mad, fearful, or anything unless you were with her at that time of the painting andd she told you how she was feeling. In conclusion I don't think the Facial Coding System will work to tell how a person is feeling."
2266,0,"Cars are beginig to come to be a big issue. They are causing so many disadvantages to overpopulated and average populated areas of the world. If the amounts of cars being driven/owned reduces we will come to plenty of advantages in manys ways. Human Health, abilities, and living spaces will all benefit from being car free! Less cars makes the area less compacted which allows more space for side walks and walk ways to be built into the small town that have a high population. Places such as VAUBAN Germany and French and Swiss borders and many other places will have noo street parking, driveways and home garages. Without all of the car infested thing such as spoken there will be appropiate space and routes for public transportation and makes things and place s more accessible. Instaed of having a mall along side a distant highway it can have walk ways and more space for shopping centers and people to come not having to worry about having to find a space to park or any other conflict we all would run into reguarding personally owned vehicles. Not mentioning many more abilities that will come to hand when we become car free. Becomming car free environments is a very important task also for health reasons of everyone. Riding bikes, hiking, and walking will all come a part of everyones daily activity if not while being publically transported.. Smog is also a big issue hear, agreed? For example, in Paris, there smog percentage went down 60% because they are going through the process of limiting ownership of cars. It is guarenteed that we will benefit from being car free. Less hassal, large decrease in accidents of vehicles and in health of all around. it is a big change but but an even larger advantage."
21350,0,"Dear TEACHER_NAME, I think cell phones should be allowed at school and to used only during free periods and turned off during class. because what if there is an emergency and the student needs to get a whole of their parents and they aren't allowed to used the schools phone. while some students used them for additions purpose's.they would have to be turned off during class so that the students will be able to learn not to focused on who's calling them or texting them. there should be a three pass rule just like the bathroom passes if you are caught using the cell phone not during free periods you would get a warning. a detention, and then the phone gets taken away. If these rules are enforced then maybe students wont need to tried to slip to use their phone during the school hours. I hope you will see my point in why students should be allowed to use cell phones during free periods."
2056,0,"Cars have become apart of the everyday life of the average person. It's a mode of transportaion that everyone uses in every second of their life; though it is faster then walking itself, cars are not always helpful to us. Sources inidcate that, by limiting car usage it is possible to relieve stress and reduce pollution. Limiting the use of cars can bring less stress to the everyday driver. When in a car, it is easy to see when the driver is stressed out. Stress accumulates with traffic jams or when someone is becoming infuriated by another driver, who is driving right in front of the other driver and going really slow. There are people who have seen there stress levels drop when they are not in or don't own a car. For instance, a community in Vauban, Germany, at least 70 percent of their residents don't own a car, while 57 percent sold their car to move there. A woman, Heidrun Walter, who is a resident there stated, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way""(Source 1). This verifies how people can get away from stress by just not having a car. In Bogota, Colombia, there is a day when automobiles are banned for a day, with the execption of buses and taxis. This day has become very popular, and is a ""good opportunity to take away stress""(Source 3), as said by Carlos Arturo Plaza, a business man who rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife on that day. On this day millions Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work, leaving the streets free of any traffic jam, when a driver gets stressed out he most, as stated in source 3. This shows the number of people who participated in this event and also shows their, less stressful, alternative modes of transportation. Along with relieving stress, pollution will become less of a problem. Cars are beneficial when it comes transportation, but they can cause harm to the environment as well. Pollution is a major problem in the today's world, and with the number of cars that are in use everyday it will only become worse. Smog or any other type of pollution can cause a city or even a country to take action. Such a Paris, Fance, who put a ban on driving to reduce pollution in their city, which rivaled Beijing, China, known as the one the most polluted cities in the world, as said in source 2. This strenghens the problems that cars pose on the world, these problems can lead to delivery companies losing money because the ban was put up and won't be lifted until the smog is gone. In addition, more information about car pollution can be found in source 1. There it talks about how cars are the ""linchpin"" of suburbs, and how they're ""a huge impediment to current efforts to drasticallly reduce greenhouse gas emissions."" In some places this is slowly resolving itself; places such as the United States have seen a drop in miles driven per person since it's peak in 2009. Sociologists believe that, ""it will have beneficial implications carbon emissions and the environment""(Source 4). This indicates that, while it is a major issue it is not impossible to solve it. Cars are an easy and fast form of transportation, but they can also cause harm to people and the environment. No matter how beneficial cars are to us, wouldn't it be better to limit the use of them? This way if cars usage is limited, then the less problems we face."
20344,0,"The Electoral College is a controversial topic in the US. This is the system used to elect the president of the United States, but most people (60% of Americans, according to source 1) believe that we shouldn't use this particular system and that we should go with the popular vote instead, while all others are strong in their stance that we should continue its use. Under the Electoral College, it is entirely possible for a Presidential Candidate to win presidency, even with the majority of voters voting for the oposing candidate. We should discard the Electoral College in favor of the popular vote. The Electoral College is a system that allots a certain amount of electoral votes to each state. Each state is given 2 electoral votes plus another amount of votes which depends on that state's population. The amount of votes ranges from 3 to 55 (source 3). A candidate must recieve 270 out of 538 possible votes. The candidate the electoral votes of a state go to is decided by the majority vote of each individual state. In all states but Maine and Nebraska give a candidate the entirety of their votes if the majority of its citizen votes for them (source 1). Some people don't even bother voting due to the fact that their vote will not contribute to their favored candidate's election. This happens often when a democratic voter lives in a republican state, and vice versa (source 3) Many people stand by the Electoral College as the best course of action. They argue that the certainty of the winner is better, a candidate can't win the election due to regional favor, and this system unsures that there will still be a clear winner even when each candidate recieves the same percentage of votes. We began using the Electoral College in order to ensure that states with low populations weren't ignored by presidential campaigns. However, it fails to do just that. Presidential candidates focus their attention to swing states, in order to win their electoral votes. Candidates have little to no need to campaign in states that have a majority of one party, because their vote is either a lost cause or all but garunteed. If this system does not do the job that it was originally intended for, then why do we continue to use it? In conclusion, the electoral college is ineffective and outdated. we should no longer use this as a system of defining our president. Even though a winner is often more clear, there is still a possibility of a tie between candidates. People who support the Electoral College also argue that its a good thing due to swing states having more attention payed to them and therefore being more careful in their decision. However, this reasoning is flawed in that it assumes that citizens of a state are more likely to inform theirselves thouroughly simply because their vote holds more value, in a sense. Also, candidates would no longer pay special attention to swing states if the electoral college weren't in place so the votes of these citizens wouldn't be held above the rest. Increased value of votes is not a good thing, which this argument also assume. It is the best decision to abolish the Electoral College."
10445,0,"The Facial Action Coding System is a new form of technology that enables computers to identify human emotions. Will the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable? No. "" FACS"" will not be valuable to read the emotional expressions of students. A theory and technology such as emotions and the emotional state of someone should be based off of science instead of being based off opinion. Take a minute and compare this new piece of technology to a quiz given on the internet to see what celebrity I would be. Moral of the story if the person can fake it, they can make it. Someone can make believable facial expressions all day does not mean they are happy, sad, or any other emotion based on what they look like. A student may come in looking grumpy does not mean they are grumpy, maybe just maybe have you ever thought. "" WOW, that just might be their natural facial expression."" To end with, unless this technology is enhanced and backed up with science instead of opinion I do not think it will be very dependable in determing the emotional expressions of students."
20815,0,"Policy 1 Policy 1 states that students are allowed to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as phones are turned off during class time. I believe this policy should be used. I believe this policy should be used because students are given the right to communicate with others. If they use them on their free time then i don't believe it would be distracting to others. You might be thinking "" why would they need them?"". There are multiple reasons. one would be a personal connection, if a family member is sick, in the hospital, or has had experience with falls, injuries, and needs someone to talk to, then i feel it is my job to help them at any time. so on my free time, i would call to make sure that they are okay, and if they need someone to talk to I'm here for them. If this policy is abused then it can be taken away. I think if students were allowed to use their phones at certain times then they wouldn't use them during class. It would make schools more appealing to students that don't feel that school is as reasonable as teachers and parents claim it to be. However, There are negatives to this policy as well. For example, after lunch, when phones are supposed to be turned off, students will not want to turn them off, due to the conversation that they were previously in because they still want to talk to this person(s). Another example of a negative affect is that after lunch, or there free time, they could be distracted by a text that might have upset them, like a break up, gossip, or cyber bulling. Policy 2 is unfair, and could cause student to break that policy, and not like school because they feel that it is a ""Stupid"" or ""Unreasonable"" rule. Also cheating is a problem with cell phones. Even though schools usually don't have service, it can lead to cheating, especially after lunch. I know this one school where the students put their phones on the teachers desk before the test, and they get it back as soon as its done. I belive that"

So that brings us back to the question,""when people ask for advice they sometimes talk to more then one person."" So you see that the potato has nine lives and the cat has 1 what is the difference between the two. that one cannot die and the other one can. People ask more than one person because they want to hear something good,or b ecuse they want to get better advice form different people. In the show Sonic X, sonic asked one of his friends on how to get all 7 kaos emeralds. wait wrong story [music stops].........I meant the Japanese story The Question, the story talks about a kid, and this kid was trying to be the strongest kid to ever be,so then the kid started to ask people how to get strong, and that was the question the question he asked him self and the choices he was going to make. another kid showed up and the kid asked the other kid ""do you really want to be strong"" the other kid said""yes"" the ghostly kid said ""you have to choices to make one is you have to 10 people 10 question about why you want to be strong the second choice is you have to slay the super dragon"" the kid chose number one, the ghostly kid said ""well done"".The kid went off to the mountains and asked the 10 people and after he was done he came out of the cave with the power to destroy the universe. You should always remember that perpendicularity of the potosytithsis crosses the bisector witch then the kinetic energy will bounce off the radios and hit the diameter witch then will colaps on the pythagerm therom,So now the genetic energy will explode like if it was uranium 232 witch then the servers will connect and create millions of nitros and million of galaxies will explode, and after that is done the microwaves fusses and make the chemical reaction witch is using thermal energy,so then the protons,electrons,neutrons,and the nukul s combines witch then you use length times wight and also height. but i am not done yet,so you see that 111=34=345 that is a very important number. as you can see that theses numbers connect the servers between the gaps of the potosytithsis, so then if you sad Creeper awwwww man, so we back in the mine got our pickaxes swing them side to side, side side to side, just task the gruling one hope to find some diamonds to night, night night night diamonds to night, because tonight the creepers are going to blow up our stuff tonight...[music stops] ""wait a minute..... this is not time for mine craft songs"" now back were i was talking about"", every day people die for a unknown reason, about 10 billion die a second because of it. some say the reason was because of potatoes and the only solution is to stop the potato and the only was to stop the potato is to go the the potato tree where the magic potato will be there and the only way to stop the potatoes is to eat the magic potato the heroes will face 0 challenges for 2+2 is 4 - 1 thats 3 quick maths. Now what did we learn today. that some types of people have good advises and some people don't witch is very sad, another thing we all learned from reading this is that you can't trust people on this earth, and how you can't trust humanity, and we all learned that every war was a mistake, and we all learned that the government just wants peoples money.1919, almost to the end,1894, close to the beginning of the mad world and this was another reason people ask for advice, you see secretly i was showing examples of people asking advice to other people, another reason of why would people ask meany other people for advice its because the person asking needs help in some way, or it needs the right advice for the right thing it wants. The person might be asking for a advice but they give the person wrong one so the person will go to a different human and ask for a different advice. people listen to get smarter and by liaising to a good advice the person will know what to do and whet not to do. one advice would be ""it is not strength that wins for its skill that matters"" that is also a quote so its pretty much the same. Always remember that the perpendicularity of the potosytithsis crosses the bisector witch then the kinetic energy will bounce off the radios and hit the diameter witch then will colaps on the pythagerm therom,So now the genetic energy will explode like if it was uranium 232 witch then the servers will connect and create millions of nitros and million of galaxies will explode, all of these thing combined will make the Mississippi river,BUT I'M NOT DONE YET, after that is done the microwaves fusses and make the chemical reaction witch is using thermal energy,so then the protons,electrons,neutrons,and the nukul s combines witch then you use length times wight and also height so then the electrons can symthisissize the H2O so then it connects the pontentchal energy and kinetic energy to fuse,and to cause a rerefration to cause a refraction to case a reflection.

13541,0,"Dear TEACHER_NAME, I believe that all students should be required to perform community service over the time that they are at SCHOOL_NAME. I have friends who love to participate in community service. I also have friends who think it takes up to much time away from what they want and need to do in their daily lives. I think that maybe if we have a requirement for at least one act of community service people will see how much fun it could be. Lots of kids today do nothing for their community. All they do is sit around and do nothing and having nothing to do leaves them at the vulnerability to commit wrongful acts against their community out of boredom. Kids are helping to mess up their community rather than helping to build it up so it can be a better place for the next generation of kids who will live there. You giving them the chance to do something for their community even if they don't want to will keep most of their minds of their minds off the bad things and on good things that others will appreciate. I myself have times when i am bored with nothing to do and i think ""Hey wouldn't it be fun to just reck something"", but i stop myself halfway in between that thought and call up one of my friends who help service their community and mine and ask if i can join with them to help out. I want my other friends who need more time to do the things they want and need to do to have more important and better thing to focus on in their lives. I would greatly appreciate it if you required our school to perform community service. P.S. It Might change the future of kids my age and younger! Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME"
6657,0,"What if you had no friends and all you did was school work? Well I think that extracurricular activities could help with that in many different ways. I Agree that all students should be in a extracurricular activity, weather it is a sport or something with the yearbook club. All students have something that at least like to do or are good at and could even get better at. If you were to do a sport for your extracurricular activity there are tons and tons of reasons why that is a good thing to do. For instance if you did a sport then that will keep you in shape. Another reason is that you can make a lot of new friends that you could become best friends with. If you are anti social doing a sport could help you with that, you could socialize with more people. However if you become very good at the sport that you do you maybe even get a scholarship for going to college witch is very very good. It could also teach you how to become a good teammate and learn how to support people that you try to succeed with. Also It can help block out all the the negative things in your life. You could become a Leader at your school. You could do that by joining the school council. If you became apart of the school council that means you could make changes in the school that you and the students think that you could benefit from and you would still be doing a extracurricular activity. If you were to become A school leader you could help kids find what they are good at and what they enjoy to do in there free time. You could also help the kids with to much that they have to do with school and other things such as sports, school ext... that need help with time management if they needed help with it. Extracurricular activities could also help with stress. It could help you by talking to your friends in the same club or sport that you do to get stuff off your mind, to help you relive or reduce stress. If you dont have many friends and you are stress about it this could help you find friends that have the same interests as you. If you are doing a extracurricular that you enjoy doing that could help relive stress, because you are doing what you love to do. Also helps you get the stuff off your mind that you struggle with. In conclusion those are some of the reasons why I think that students should do a extracurricular activity. There are many more reasons why this is good for students. There are reasons why this can be a bad thing but there arn't as many reasons and I think that the good overrules the bad. Thats why I think students should have to take a extracurrular activity."
24202,0,"Students should not be given the freedom to learn from home. For past generations, students have always learned from their teacher through a lecture or practice. For almost all students, the way most retain their knowledge is through listening or sight. Practice is also important but if the student is at home while the teacher is at school teaching then how will the student learn or get answers for their work? Although students believe that learning at home benefits their learning style, home schooling would not the students because there are no teachers to push the students to have more motivation and while working at home there is no resources to help them besides the internet. Students shouldn't be allowed to stay at home and work because they will get no work finished. There are too many distractions like technologies, hobbies, and sleep deprivation. If the student knew that they did not have to wake up early the next morning, most likely the student will stay up late and go to bed at an unreasonable time. There is nothing stopping teens from leaving the house and leaving to go hangout with friends because the student knows if they get back home at this time and finish their work before 11:59pm everything will be okay. This teaches students bad work ethics and horrible habits that will surely carry on to the work force if they don't stop. Especially, since there are no teachers to make sure work is regulated, students have no motivation to get up in the morning and complete work with good time and obvious effort. Students should not be given the freedom to ""learn at home"" becasue there aren't many reliable resources to help students fully understand the lesson given to them. After reading on a subject that is close to foregin to any student, If they don't understand what is going on what do they do? If the student decieded to do the assignment late they won't be able to get an asnwer from the teacher. They could ask a friend but there's a chance that they don't understand it either. The student has to result to ""googling"" the answer, which could result in muliple answers or it becomes to complex to disipher. The problem with attempting to learn on the internet is the fear of the information being incorrect or it not being the way the teacher wants the student to learn. While others believe that students benefit from learning at home, Truthfully, learning at home only causes distractions and clueless students. Naturally, students learn best from hands on practice with the guidenace from their teachers. Students can not recieve the practice and motivation from their teachers at the comfort of their home. From staying at home, it causes confusion and more stress for the student. Most of the time, many students don't ask questions to their teachers due to shyness and fear of stupitidy at school. If students don't want to ask teachers for help at school then the possibility of students asking for help at home is difinitively lower. The schools that allow students to ""learn at home"" are unacceptable because they are impeding on students learning and creating bad work ethics. While in the eyes of a student the opportunity could look exciting and beneficial, in the end the ""personal learning route"" is only hurting the students in the long run."

He said yes right then he knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime. UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. Luke signed up with his friend Don. Before arriving in Greece, Luke turned 18 years old, which meant he could be drafted for military service. When his draft board learned he was on a cattle-boat trip, they told him to keep doing that for his service. By the time he was discharged in 1947, he had made 9 trips the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. The cattle boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for Luke. Besides helping people, he had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special. Luke toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Caring for the animals during the crossings kept him busy. They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalls had to be cleaned. Helping out on his aunt Katie's farm as a boy had prepared him for hard work, but not for dangers at sea. He couldn't work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs. Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke. It opened the world up to him. He is grateful for the opportunity. It made him more aware of people of other countries and their needs. The awarness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years."
3824,0,"The last minute strike on the last day of school, students are eager to leave school right away and start their vacation. As time progresses, They tend to lose valuable information they learned from the previous school year. In order to prevent this, some schools assign summer projects to assure that students will continue to learn during the break with a teacher designed or student designed. in which case that, these summer projects should be student designed because it'll improve their knowledge, decrease their laziness, and it'll give them the opportunity to learn new things. Although, some schools prefers teacher designed projects instead of student designed This makes sense because most students relies on the teacher to provide them the information they need in order to complete the project and it'll be easier for them to understand. However, It causes confusion to students that dont understand or is struggling to what the question is asking and which later builds up stress. Therefore, These summer projects should be student designed. Starting with improving their knowledge, students have a hard time understanding of previous and new materials in the new school year. If the summer project were a student designed, students can go improve their knowledge by understanding on the topic they worry to forget. In this research, Generic_Name is an 11th grader that is concern of forgetting the basic of literature and annotations. On her project, she provided of how reading through databases and books that helped her understand more about literature. With the annotation she wrote down helpful websites with tips that can improve annotating. This proves that with the student designed project, It helps you go on your own pace and understand the material more. Another research is Generic_Name from 9th grade, He has been struggling with US history and key events of WWII. With his project, he remembered the important dates and researched more information about those events that happened. This shows that with jogging down materials from previous events and providing more gathered materials helps them improved their knowledge of the lesson. In addition, It can decrease their laziness. Over the summer, students are usually unmotivated to do anything or on widgets to kill time. If the summer project was student designed, student can spend their time outside and be motivated to find their research. In evidence, a high school student was planning to research about the Cherokee online and not going to a museum about Native Americans, Instead she went out to D.C and gathered information about Cherokee, researched events and tour about the Cherokee lifestyle. This shows that with the student designed project, they can explore outside and be productive. In another evidence, an elementary school student was to research about evolution of butterflies. They gathered materials to find where they live and with very detailed how the process from a caterpillar turned to a butterfly. This shows that with going out to research a butterfly instead of reading a children's book about butterfly evolution can decrease the laziness through the summer break. Finally, It'll give them opportunities to learn new things. Most students know basics notes they knew back and to which, doesn't expand on their learning. With the student-designed project, they can explore any new subject to work on and research. For example, a 5th grader was assigned a summer project about anything and they wanted to research on prehistoric animals such as dinosaurs,they can receive and gain new facts and notes about their habitat,types of species,etc. This proves that students will improve on learning with new gathered materials they received. In another example, Generic_Name was a 7th grader who knew nothing about Gettysburg Address. Gathering all the historic website she was provided from her history teacher, she read very intellectual quotes and statements from President Lincoln that provided her new information about Abraham Lincoln and Gettysburg Address. This shows that with no knowledge about the topic, you can still find new resources and opportunities to find the topic On to the end, every student loses at least the most valuable lessons they learned in their previous school year. If students were to have the own designed project over the summer, they can go beyond with improving their knowledge, be more motivated to decrease their laziness and lastly have a bit freedom to search more opportunities to learn new things."

Would you come up with one your self and just choose that or would you have an idea but seek others opinions first before acting. Whichever one you are, Im here to tell you the advantages of seeking others opinions first before acting out. The first thing your wondering might be why seeking others opinion's helps. Well you would get more opinions of something that your unsure about. You could also get feedback on your choice to truly decide if it is right or not. But if we are talking about getting others opinions in writing than, they could see errors and spelling problems that maybe you don't catch or the computer doesn't catch. Finally, to appeal to more people, you could tweak your writing based on other people's opinions to include more thoughts. The outcome of receiving other opinions towards your actions are, you'll be more reflective and relate able towards other people. Meaning, you'll be able to agree and converse about more topics rather than just being self centered. Your writing includes multiple ideas and personalities in your writing. Lastly, your choices are changed based on other people because you will think, what would so and so think if they were in my shoes right now. Your mental and physical health also are affected by the opinions of others. For instance, when deciding in the future you will lean to other people or think about what someone else would do before deciding what is right. When talking about more physical health rather than mental health, you will act more considerately and thoughtful around others instead of selfishly. The affects of this could be that your taking in others ideas so you will tend to consider them in similar incidents when you have to choose either the right or the wrong. You might also act more thoughtful too others because you learn their opinions which might change your overall mindset. All of this leading too you being a better person in general and giving you a thoughtful and more considerate mindset rather than a selfish and self-centered one. So the take away is that it doesn't take much to broaden your mindset and make you a better person, you just need to think of others maybe a little more than you used too."
25417,0,"Have you ever asked someone for advice? Did you go to one person or did you go to several people for advice? Does it matter how many people you ask for advice? In short, yes it does matter how many people you ask for advice. In fact, the more the better advice you get. Asking more than one person for advice can get you better version of what you're trying to do. The more people you ask, the better the answer. Asking more than one person for advice can get you a more accurate rating of what you should do. The blue socks or the red socks? Ask around, see which ones your friends and family enjoy more. Sometimes, you can also get another option if you're stuck. Let's say you're working on a project and you don't know what to do. Ask some people as to what you should do, maybe you'll get an amazing idea. Asking several people for advice can give you a more beneficial response. Let's say you have a massive test, your friend has already taken this test. You ask him, ""Should I study?"" He responds with, ""No, it was easy."" So you just go with his advice and you don't study. You get to the test day and you realize don't know anything about it, you end up failing the test. If you had just asked your other friends for advice as well, you would've known that it was hard and that you needed to study. You shouldn't just ask one person for advice, they can't just be the end-all-be-all decision maker. You should ask several people whether or not you should do something. A person can be invalid, bias, or even wrong, that's why you consult more than one doctor when you have bad news. Maybe the other doctor realizes something the first one didn't. It's also precisely why consulting more than one person for advice can give a better answer. Asking a variety people for advice can also give a more accurate response of what you should do. Maybe you're indecisive about which gaming console you should get, X box or PlayStation 4? You ask your friends and you decide, they give you the pros and cons and even tell you which one they have. You can get a more accurate response of what you should do. You should always consult a variety of people because maybe they can think of something you can't. Different people think about things in different ways. Just the like X box or PlayStation 4 example, people have their reasons, different people have different reasons. Let's say you have a more important decision, like which medication you should take. You should ask different specialist and pharmacist about which one they think is better. Maybe one has less side effects than the other, you won't know unless you ask. If you ask a variety of people you'll get answers that reflect on the right decision that you should make. Asking more people can get you different options if you're stuck. Maybe you don't know what you should write on your essay, you're just stuck and you can't think of what to do. Ask your friends and family as to what you should write, maybe they can give you different options of what you can write. Different prompts, different styles of writing, everyone has their own experiences. You haven't done everything which is what makes other people's points valid, maybe they've done something you haven't. You may get stuck but you shouldn't stay stuck if you ask for advice. The power of asking several people is endless, people can come up with amazing ideas, even if you can't. If you're stuck, ask for some advice, maybe someone was in your shoes and they can give you and answer. It matters that you ask a variety of people for advice because advice can make and idea better, or you could find an amazing idea from advice. You shouldn't rely on one person to give you advice, you should have a group of people. The more people you ask, the better the advice will be. Advice can add on to an idea or it can build an idea. Asking for advice gives you more accurate feedback of what you should do. Maybe you're indecisive and you don't know what to do, ask for some advice to help you along your way. Maybe you can find another solution to the problem you're thinking of, maybe someone has a brilliant idea but they just haven't discovered it. You can be the person who can discover it.

Community service is a great thing that should be encouraged. It can go from helping a fellow student with a tough assignment to cleaning up after a natural disaster, and can help many life's along the way. It doesn't even have to be hard, if you enjoy knowing you made a difference. It may even teach students a thing or two about life. It can help teach a teen responsibilities and priorities. It can focus them on wanting to make a change for the better. Even if its just Picking up trash on the ground when outside, it makes that much less pollution and hazards to animal life. Not only that, but it can influence others to help someone in need or just to do what's right morally. It could even be used as punishment to those who would rather disrupt a class than learn. It is very likely they wouldn't enjoy picking up someone's discarded food off campus, or somewhere else. It may even set a few straight and back, goal oriented. It would also help earn a good reputation for them and their school. I believe it could help students for the better. Thank you for your time and please consider my words. I am happy I could share my opinion even if it doesn't make a difference. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME"
18315,0,"I think driverless cars are a great invention. Driverless cars would make everyone's lives easier. It would save lots of time, and even keep people safer. I think everyone should have access to self driving cars. This technology could help us improve our lives, and open a new world of technology for us. I strongly agree with Google cofounder, Sergy Brin, on his ideas about public transportation. Public transportation systems that self drive would be amazing. It would indeed change the world. These cars would make transportation extremely easy, and replace old cars. These cars could also make driving even more safer for people. The self driving cars have sensors that can auto brake. This could prevent many accidents in the future, and maybe save lives. Although this technology may help, it all lies on the driver. This technology may cause carless drivers. All in all, the technology of driverless cars could make driving safer than it is today. Overall, I think that driverless cars are a good idea. They are safer for people, and young drivers. Also, they are just convienient for us. It would improve out quality of life. I would like to see these care implemented into our daily lives."
18461,0,"Have you ever dream of a future where cars are driven by themselves? Well that dream will be coming faster than you think. With the advances in technology we are getting closer and closer in achieving a driveless car. Driveless cars could change the world so much. Thus it is a good idea that they should be made possible. Driveless cars could help make the world better. We would no longer have to worry about how we would get to certain ares. All we would have to do is call in a driveless car, get in it, and it would take us to our destinantion. Another thing that make driveless car great is that it would use half the fuel of what we use today. It would also cause less accidents due to having sensors and thus alearting the driver when an accident might be possible. These type of cars might be great but they have a lot of flaws. Some flaws are that they are not 100% driveless yet. They need the passanger to be on alert at all time so that when the soutition rises they can take over control. For example the article states,""notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigationg through work zones and around accidents."" Another thing to worry about is that who would be blame if the technology fails and someone is injuried or even killed? Would it be the driver or the manufacture that gets the blame? These are thing that we should be thinking about before we put this invention for sale. All those flaws might give the wrong impression about driveless cars, but we can find a soulution to all these constraints. They might not be 100% driveless yet, but we are getting there. The advances in technology that we accomplish every day is growing rapidly. Every year we are creating and making our technology beter. For example, the article stats that.""Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020."" Companies are also developing driver seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger. Another this is that the sensor might not be as good as we want today, but imagine how much better and advance they might be in about 5-10 years. Improvement in sensors, computer hardware, and software are making driving safer which is leading to driveless cars to be able to handle more and do more driving tasks on their own. Currently we might have some contraints that are holding us back, but in time we will be able to get rid of them. With the improvements in our software and senors being made every day; we will be closer in achieving a 100% workable car. The advances in technology will help us create them and in time make them a realitiy. Driveless cars should be made."
5548,0,"Hello my name is Luke I think you guys should join the program because its fun you can even join when you are out of high school. A man came up to me at one of my jobs and asked if I wanted to do it so I had to say yes because I knew it would be fun to do. You also get to travel places with the other cowboys. We do this to help the countries in Europe that got destroyed in World War II recover. We help them get thier animals food supplies. 44 other nations helped us and all together. we made something called UNRRA that stands for United Nations Relief and Rehibitation Administation. Thats were I come in the UNRRA hired Seagoing Cowboys to take care of the horses and cattle and mules so me and Don signed up. If you turn 18 when you are a Seagoing Cowboy you can be drafted to the military services but they might tell you to keep doing the Seagoing Cowboy for a service. I even got to see Europe, China, Greece, Italy and more. It made me aware on other countries and their needs. It was also fun to be on board. I got to play table tennis, baseball, volleyball, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games that passed time. I think you should join to and do all of the fun things I did. You will learn a lot of things. You will aslo learn about other people and not thinkig about yourself."
19251,0,"I think we should get rid of electoral college because its not fair that some of the larger sates get more votes than the little states and its also not fair that some states are a win and take all state, it also dosent make sence that if you are winning the popular vote you still have possibality that you could lose the campagin. the other the thiing with electoral collage it can a tie the house of represntative gets to pick and they aare most likely to vote for the vice presidant. On paragraph 13 it says that ""the electoral college is still un fair to voters because of all the winner takes all system"" so that would hurt the chance of the person running there campaign there because they know there not gonna have achance winning that state so they dont even try to campaign there, also on paragrahph 23 it says that ""voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preferance rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election"" i also think the way of electoral votes is an outdated methothed of voting and should let the people have more power and actually count for the person they want to win."
25713,0,Have you ever wanted a better view of a situation that you have just been tasked with too complete. Then you should try asking multiple people for their view on the situation don't believe me i might just change your mind. Now you wouldn't want to go in blind and get smashed with a metaphorical boat load of work because you didnt ask people what was going on or what was happening because you were uninformed. One example would be going to a new restaurant that is new in town were the service is OK but not the best and the food is horrid all because you didnt check the reviews. You could have avoided wasting your time by just checking the reviews and taking other peoples opinion on the restaurant but you didnt and now you see the importance of others opinions. also another example would be advisers such as school advisers or presidential advisers they both have the same job and that is to give you their opinion. Now you might be wondering well how will this change the outcome of anything let me tell you that it can change the way you think and also your view of the situation. Also the way it can change your view is almost like chess you have to be thinking like the opponent to understand what they are going to do next and also from their point of view were they can see something you can not see. Another example would be buying something like a game or a movie you want to get your moneys worth so you ask for peoples opinions to see witch one is better. Everyone makes choices some big some small and some that are so big that you cant decide all by your self and you want to have the best possible outcome you can possibly get. and that is why you should always take other peoples opinions into account because no matter how much you care in the end they will all matter.
841,0,"Cell phones have some way of taking our full individual attention for however long we allow it to. We become easily distracted and connected to our phones. People usually look at it just to look at it, without any notifications popping up, solely based on us humans being attracted to our phone. There also is that part of us using our cell phones to stay in the mix, see what's hot on Instagram, or if that hot guy or girl posted on Snapchat. There are many times and places you could multitask with your phone. However, driving a vehicle is not something you should try to multitask with because slip-ups while driving are very unforgiving. One minor mistake on the road can cause your life or someone else's life to be taken. Therefore, drivers should not be able to use cell phones while driving. Fatality is an occurrence of death by accident. Sure you do not mean harm when you are texting your friend while you are driving, but once that sudden stop or movement you did not see causes you to crash, you could possibly die or kill someone else. No one behind the wheel of a vehicle expects it to be their last time driving. However, approximately 660,000 people are attempting to use their phones while driving (""Texting and Driving Accident Statistics). According to The National Safety Council, cell phone use leads to 1.6 million crashes each year (""On the Road). Nearly 390,000 injuries were caused by accidents attributed to texting and driving (""Texting and Driving Accident Statistics""). In 2016, 3,450 fatalities were caused by texting and driving (""Texting and Driving Accident Statistics""). Also one out every four car crashes in the United States are caused by texting and driving (""Texting and Driving Statistics). In conclusion, texting and driving is dangerous to lives of others. Texting and driving is just as dangerous as driving under the influence. Some people would agree that driving while drunk is the most common and dangerous thing you could do. However, The National Safety Council states that someone texting while driving is six times more likely to cause an accident than someone driving drunk (""On the Road""). Therefore, it is more common for people to be distracted by their phones to cause an accident than driving under the influence is. Reaction times decrease by 35% when texting and driving, compared to the 12% decrease when driving under the influence of alcohol (""Texting While Driving is More Dangerous than Drinking and Driving""). Steering control while distracted is 91% poorer than those who are driving with full concentration (""Texting While Driving is More Dangerous than Drinking and Driving""). In 2002, there were 12,405 drunk driving fatalities (Masters); then that number decreased to 9,296 in 2011 (Masters). However, distracted driving resulted in approximately 2,600 deaths in 2002 (""Texting while driving Vs. Drunk Driving: Which Is More Dangerous). The number of distracted driving accidents increased by 22% in 2011 and resulted in 3,331 fatalities (Masters, ""Texting While Driving Vs. Drunk Driving: Which Is More Dangerous?). Drive to drive; texting and driving is just as bad as driving drunk. Texting and driving is now illegal in multiple states, which means you are committing a crime when you text and drive. According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, 47 states plus Washington D.C. ban texting for all drivers (""Texting & Driving Laws: Is it Illegal in Your State?""). Four states allow officers to pull someone over for texting, without any other reason (""Texting & Driving Laws: Is it Illegal in Your State?""). In California, the consequence is $20 for the first offense and $50 for each subsequent offense (""Texting & Driving Laws: Is it Illegal in Your State?""). There are other states who take the offense more serious, Alaska you could be charged with a misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in prison and a $50,000 fine. Kill someone while texting and driving, and you could be looking at 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 (""Texting & Driving Laws: Is it Illegal in Your State?""). Then a car accident would lead to your car insurance to rise. According to a group of researchers, they found that some kind of texting law leads to a 2.3% decrease in fatalities for all drivers. Specifically banning teen drivers from texting reduced traffic deaths in that group by 11 percent (""Texting & Driving Laws: Is it Illegal in Your State?""). In conclusion, texting and driving could ultimately cause you unnecessary fees, or big time in prison. In summary, drivers should know that they are dealing with something serious when driving a car. There are limited chances in life;texting and driving are pushing those chances away. Drive with the intent and purpose to get to your destination. Deal with texts after or before you drive, because it could cost you everything. Attention is highly needed when driving, there are split-second decisions to be made while driving and your phone distracts your attention enough to potentially cause accidents. Your reaction time is based on how early you see it, looking at a phone prohibits you from reacting. In conclusion, put your phone away while driving to save lives!

24899,0,"Most of us, as human beings, need other's help for certain things. Whether that be for school work or friendship advises, we all need someone's help at least once in our lives. When we are uncertain of something, we often times ask for help from the people around us. Having multiple people to ask and consult with is a great idea rather than just having one. Seeking help from multiple people can have great benefits, such as having different opinions to build your own opinion, having different experiences from a variety of people to understand the situation clearer, and it's always better to have multiple people to rely on. Our opinions are shaped by other's opinions through out our lives. In order to build an opinion to take action or maybe to just keep it to ourselves, we must learn new angles and learn new opinions. Just as if it was math, the current knowledge is to be built on prior knowledge, it's no different for having an opinion. We are heavily influenced by the people around us, such as our parents or friends. When we combine the opinions of others on a situation, we can gather them up to make one solution. It's like adding pieces of a puzzle to make one grand masterpiece, we add the opinions of others to make our own opinion. There are multiple times when I have an opinion on something, such as a hobby, person, or situation and when other's share their opinions on it, sometimes I learn new things from them! It opens up a door to a new way of thinking and makes me more open minded. Asking for other's advises to build your own thought is a great way to learn what other's think and to also have a reliable idea. People often say to ask advice from your parents or any adults around you because they're older. They're older so they have more experience which can come in handy. Having anyone that has gone through the same or a similar situation as yourself can help you avoid other mistakes or help you out in a situation in general. It's a wise idea to ask for advice or the opinions of others who have more experience in whatever you need help with. It's more likely you're going to go ask a math teacher for your math homework rather than your English teacher. It's just a good idea to ask someone for help for something when that person knows something about the topic. Even if you do know about the matter, it doesn't hurt to get more insight about it! It's always better to stay safe than to say sorry. When people are in a tough situation, it's always good to have people behind you. Getting the opinions of others gives you multiple people to turn to in case you need them. It's similar to writing a research paper since you should get multiple sources to research from to make sure your information is reliable. It's a reassuring feeling to know that you have people who agree with you and perhaps even have that feeling that you're right in certain situations. It's always a good idea to get other's words because you have more information to go off of and also because it's just reassuring! It's a great idea to talk to multiple people about something that is bothering you or you are curious about rather than one. It doesn't hurt to ask for other's opinions and it's always a good thing to do at the end. We can achieve something or resolve the problem better if we get the help of others. Someone's opinion may shape your own opinion in a totally different way and it's smart to understand and use other's knowledge to your ability. Seeking help from multiple people can have great benefits such as having different opinions to build your own opinion, different experiences to build more knowledge, and also because it's always good to have people to rely on."
1736,0,"Limiting the usage of cars has a varirty of advantages. From having a less expensive life, to less air pollution, and overall a generally happier life. Thinking about all the excess and stress that comes with owning a car is tiring. Not to mention the hazardous effect it had on our lives. Would it not be nice to just take off some of that burden off of you, and be a happier person?.Let me help you out on how to achieve that. Owning a car is pricey! In Freiburg along with paying for your house you also have to pay for a parking garage, which comes with a hefty price. Did i not mention the distance you have to walk to park? lets just say you might as well have taken the bus.""Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park---large garages at the edge of the development,where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.""(source one,section two). With you alone driving to work and back everyday will tally up to over a hundred dollars spent every week, now add children into it, and their after school ativities, also add emergencies. See where this is going? sure you might need a car now and then, having a car is not a bad thing. How about Carpooling? It will reduce that price you have on your gas recipts and create more time for bonding and interacting with people. Health or driving? Well if you are not healthy you can not drive can you? With all of the automobiles we have today it is bound to affect the earth. The smog in the air leading to that first cough that can lead to something more terminal. Imagine what it would be like if you had less cars, or even no cars at all! well the capital of France tried it and the results were amazing.""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog..""(source two,section fourteen). Now think about if that ban that Paris enforced,was tried out in other countries. Just that little change in the amount of cars on the road let to that difference of the pollution. Probably led to a difference in someones health too. Everything stated above leads to happiness, from the less expences that will have to be paid, and the less damage that the pollution will have on your health. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter""source one, section three).Also when there are less cars on the road your community will be able to connect more and have better infranstructure, which would make them happy just like it did for the people of Bogata, Columbia.""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks;rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic;and new resturants and upscale shopping districts have been cropped up.""(source three,section twenty-eight). Overall the advantages of limiting car usage has many benefits to it. From having a less expensive life, by not having to pay for gas so often, car insurance, and evrything else that comes with it. Having better health also is a advantage of the limitation of car usage. Also one of the most important aspects of life, happiness comes with the limitation of using cars. So there is no reason to not try it out, there will be more benefits."
15318,0,Dear Principal I know that we should at least have a B average when were playing sports but i think students still could at least have a c average. The reason i think this is because sometimes it's hard to do sports and get a good grade. Sometimes it not always be about the sports being involved it can be issues involving outside of the school for example family issues. Maybe it could be even though were playing sports it could be that we try our best but we still don't get it but it's just too hard for people to understand. But I still don't think that it's fair to take away sports because actually sports is good for us. It gives us a boost to work harder because we just can't wait to go and do that sport. Also I don't think that it is fair that the student's with a B average get to play and we don't. Another reason i think it's not fair is because then it would make students angry and they would probably start a petition or something close to that and start not doing their work and that would be bad for their education. Another one of my reasons is what if one of the other outside activities involved helping charity and we had a C then in that situation would we still not be allowed to do that or in that kind of situation could we be allowed to do that outside activity with a C average and that was one question that i' m sure will get people thinking about and maybe want to consider not to change the grading average we would have to have in order to participate in sports. Instead of changing the grading policy that we have to have for sports why couldn't we just change another rule for something else. Also and my last statement for letting us play sports even though we don't have a B average is because it helps the school and it helps the school by every time we hold an event and games we are help raising money for the school so we can by more technology an supplies to make the school better. Them are all my reasons why I think she shouldn't change the rules on everyone should have a B average instead of just having a C or better. I hope that you read my letter and think about all my reasons for keeping the grading policy for sports the way their suppose to be thank you for reading this and hope that ensure mine and everyone's wishes for keeping the grading policy for sports. Sincerely: STUDENT_NAME
15526,0,"Dear principle whatever-your-name-is, I disagree with this new policy. Having this policy in effect can only cause trouble and revolt. The students will not like this and I think they are well justified. This policy only hurts students because it makes them feel like they are being singled out for punishment. Some students wrap their whole lives around sports and if these are taken away from them then they feel like there's no reason to try anymore. For some students sports are a stress reliever. Some students can be stressed out from having to spend all day cooped up in a classroom. Some of them may turn to sports as a way to relieve some of that energy. For some students spending time in sports is a way to get away from a troubled household. Some of your students may get verbally or physically abused. Sports may be their way to stay away from home for as long as they can or to just have a safe haven where they don't have to worry about their safety or the safety of family members. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME"
323,0,"Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. Due to many statistics and other research cellular devices are the main causes of car accidents. Many scientists have proven to us that cellphones put drivers at a very great risk of getting into a wreck. Even with this information drivers still choose to use there phone behind the wheel. Drivers have even resulted to using hand free devices, because they think that this is safer. Some people use the excuse that ""If there's an emergency they may need there cellular device"" to support the face of using their phone behind the wheel. There's a lot of evidence to support why drivers should not use their phone behind the wheel. When driving it's very hard to focus on both the road and your phone. It's very easy to forget that your sharing the road with other people. Other people on take notice to drivers being on the cellular devices even if they don't want to or not because of the hazards they create. Texting while driving is the more dangerous than talking while driving. You take your eyes off the road for one minute and boom you've gotten into a wreck. Most of the drivers that fall into this category are teens. These drivers have the highest fatalities behind the wheel due to using a phone. In the state of Utah using your phone behind the wheel, and you cause an accident it can land you in jail for up to 15 years. Most teens use airpods made by Apple inc, instead of holding the phone in there hand. This is even more dangerous because you can't hear your surroundings. In conclusion: if people continue to use there cellular devices behind the wheel he number of casualties on the roads they will continue to increase.. It is the people's responsibility to not put their own and others people lives at risk due to there horrible actions."
25858,0,"Have you ever wanted to do something, but wasn't sure if it was the right decision? Well, sometimes it's good to get another person's opinion on the matter, and it's even better to get multiple opinions. It is good to see what the majority thinks, and if you're completely lost, it's good to have choices. Most importantly of course, is the fact that they may give you some helpful advice! First off, It's good to see what the majority thinks about your issue. For example, it's Saturday and you have a project due Friday of next week. You want to take time on the weekend to relax, but you don't want to procrastinate. So you ask your friends and other people you know what to do. If the majority says do the project, you should probably do it. The majority decision is usually the best way to go. Secondly, If you have no clue what to do, it is good to have some direction. Nobody likes being completely lost, so it is good to have a plan. But if you can't come up with one, then you're going to need some help. It's good to work with a group because you all have ideas that you can follow. Work together, and you can all come up with a good plan. Lastly-and the most obvious- you can get other people's advice. Having a hard time deciding what to get for lunch? Ask all of your friends! If you have tough project that's due in three days, ask someone for design ideas. It is extremely helpful and will make youre life a thousand times easier! In conclusion, asking for multiple opinions is extremely helpful. The majority decision is usually the best and having direction can help eliminate confusion. Lastly, you can get tons of helpful advice that will save you lots of head scratching! You can make better decisions in life if you have a direction to follow, and that's probably why we ask questions. Always remember to ask questions, because you may end up making better decisions."
23347,0,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I do not think that students would benefit as much as they should by using this sort of learning tool. The idea of offering distance learning is not bad, it just doesn't seem like it would work to me. There would be too much work for teachers to keep up with both students at home and students at school, it isn't worth the effort. The effort of integrating this type of learning into school would be a wasted one. What if it works? What if there was a good way of making distance learning to work? I dont think it matter if there was a way to do it, because I don't think that most students would do it at all. Students are already tired of the day in day out routine of going to school everyday with the exception of the weekends of course. I think if kids in high school or middle school are stuck at home, they would just rather relax, and who is it say that students might play games or do something else while in the video call with the class, it is possible to happen. Long distance learning through online video calling a class would not work as good as being in the classroom in person. As opposed to the video conferencing, a student can raise their during a lecture or notes to ask question in a quick and swift manner as, on the other hand; students in a conference call with a teacher would most likely take longer and not to mention the student would be most likely to not ask a question at all. Another problem with this video conference way of teaching from home to school would be the problem of students talking over each other, when in a call with multiple people it could be chaotic and a mess for the teachers to teach efficiently. What if a students internet goes down and they are disconnected from the call and can't participate in the class? Or what if a student has to leave for something important whatever it may be? video conferencing just wouldn't work for students and teachers. You may be asking: ""what about sick students that would like to learn? they could benefit from doing online video conferencing with a class."" That may be true that sick students can benefit and it would seem smart, but, sick students need their rest. If students have to be up in the morning till afternoon working at home while they are sick they would never get better. Unless a student is brought down with a long term sickness that could last longer than a month, then I don't think that they should use this method of learning from home. In conclusion I believe that video conferencing from home to a classroom would not be a good use of time for the students or the teachers."
6392,0,"I think that if a child don't wanna do at least one extracurricular activity the child don't have to because of work,family,money, and maybe the child is just tried and wanna chill after school. Family can take up a lot of time. If you have a brother's or sister's maybe even someone in your family is sick and you have to take care of them. Sometimes your mom and dad have to work. On top of going to school and making sure your grades are good so you'll be able to stay in your extracurricular activity. That takes a lot of time and after a while you'll get tried and that's not healthy. Money can be a big reason why you can't do one. Most extracurricular activity cost a lot of money mostly sports. It can even be getting to where your suppose to go because some people don't have cars. Some people have to go to work depending on if what grade there in and there mom or dad have the money or not. extracurricular cost a lot of money that people don't have. Sometimes work can get in the way of extracurricular activity. If your in high school depending or your age you might have a job. Taking time or showing up late to your job will hurt your pay check might even get fried. High school is not the only one that goes threw this all grades do most of the time people moms and dads have to work. That happened's to a lot of kids and Teens. Lastly sometimes after a long day if school you might wanna go home and chill. School is a lot to handle on the mind. To class work, grades, and people sometimes a child don't even like to talk to people but there family. After doing studying,doing homework and taking test you'll get tried and dont wanna do anything else. That's a lot of work on the mind. Finally people have others things to do or can't do it at all because of work, money family, and just dont wanna do anything. But at the end of the day it's the persons choice if she/he wanna do it or not but I say no."
10734,0,"I vow against the value of using technology to read student's emotional expressions. My reasoning is big data companies will configure this to their advantage and bordeom in a classroom can guide someone toward something higher. To begin,""Big Brother"" will exploit this in order to make money off of it unsuspectedly. The text gives an example of what the technology can do in terms of personalizing ads. It does not matter who someone is big data companies, will find clever ways of gathering anyones data in exchange making life more simple no matter if that person is student or not. Once the data is stockpiled, it is on the internet and avaliable to anyone that pays for it. Secondly, bordeom as terrible as it sounds is good for the brain. Bordeom in the text is mentioned as something that looms in the learning environment and this new technology can help create a more effective lesson. The second society lets such algorithms coexist with AI that is when the people lose control of their lives; because, it will let robotic minds make decisions for society. Boredom is misunderstood, it can allow society to have think beyond the surface and allows someone to excel as they then understand the joy of a subject has detierated, now looking anew. To conclude, ""Big Brother"" would manipulate this technology to profit and boredom is beneficial. Not everything is what it presents itself as on the surface."
9775,0,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because In the text it states that venus is actually a planet and venus is the second planet from the sun. The text also states that venus is simple to see from a far distant. Finally, it says that numerous factors contribute to venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study in etc. If you look back in paragraph 1& 2 that's where I got all the information from to support my answer. In conclusion studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because if you just reread everything in this passage it's basically telling you alot of information about venus. If you look back in the passage in read paragraph 8 it's giving you information about venus it says that venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. The last in final thing is that our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. So that basically tells you everything about why studying is a worthy pursuit despite for venus."
11580,0,"Classrooms in this time period are filled with high-tech computers and new innovations that are useful to teachers and students. It seems like every month something new is added to classrooms that can help stimulate learning. Some of these new inventions are something that no one would of ever imagined. That's what makes them so appealing and why people grab them off shelves the first chance they can. This technology, you can't quite grab off the shelves, but it is something that is worth installing. This new software, Facial Action Coding System(FACS), relys on facial muscles to identify what emotions someone is feeling. One can only imagine all the different possibilities someone could have with this software, but a major possibility is installing it in classrooms. This technology would be useful to have in classrooms because it can advance learning, prevent bullying, and help identify mental disorders. There are countless times, when one starts to daze and daydream instead of paying attention in the classroom. Daydreaming is just so much better then having a teacher talk about spectator ions and how iconic compounds can be net or not. However, this new technology,FACS, could be very useful in the classroom for this reason. The reason being is that it can advance learning like we never would of thought. This computer would have the ability to stimulate lessons that would keep kids enterained and focused. In turn, they would be more likely to learn more and retain the knowledge. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored""(D'Alto). If this computer sensed that the child was becoming unfocused, it could do something about it, unlike teachers who sometimes don't always catch when a student is falling asleep or daydreaming. However, this computer would know and it could fix the issue right away so the child would be learning throughout the day. Since the computer keeps the child focused and learning for a longer amount of time, the child would have the ability to become more intelligent because it would be spending more time learning. This could lead to all different sorts of opportunities for the child, like special education programs, scholarships, etc. Bullying is a serious issue. It can sometimes be hard to spot and to solve, and no matter how hard people try, it never goes away. It's always there in the hallways of some schools, lurking over some and haunting them. Yet, what if there was a way to reduce bullying in a big way? Well, now there is with the help the FACS. FACS could reduce bullying because it would be able to identify if, for an extended period of time, a child was feeling sad and/or scared. Then a teacher would know something is up. ""By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions...""(D'Alto). Since this software can recognize mixed emtions, it would be able to tell if a child was showing the side effects of being bullied. By recognizing that if a child is being bullied, would help the child because they could talk to an adult and hopefully the problem would be solved. Also, if bullies knew that this software was in schools, then they would be less likely to bully because there would be a greater likeliness of them being caught. Overall, lower levels of bullying would result in higher self-esteem and confidence which then can be reflected in acedemics. Everyday kids walk through the halls of school and feel like they are totally alone in how they feel. They feel like they will have to live the rest of their lives feeling the way they do, and they become hopeless. This effects their acedemics because they are less focused and might not care how they do in school. However, if FACS was installed in schools, maybe kids could get the help they need. ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling by simply looking on her face""(D'Alto). In some cases, this quote might be true. However, when it comes to having a mental disorder, most friends can't just guess how their friend is feeling. This is where FACS would come into play. This system would be able to know how a child is feeling and then, if those emotions are typically out of the range of what a normal teenager might be feeling, they could be sent to a professional. This professional could then diagnose the teenager whose been feeling this way and possibly have therapy. Overall, they would help them so they will feel better. After all this is done, and the teenager starts feeling better and being able to focus on school, their acedemics could skyrocket. With all the new inventions and innovations that have been becoming known to society throughout the years, FACS is one of them that could have a postive affect on the public and, more specifically, classrooms. This technology would have the ability to advance learning by sensing when a child is losing interest and then change the lesson to keep them entertained and continue learning. It could also prevent bullying by knowing when a child has been feeling a certain way for a long time, and then other mearures could be taken to help the child. Lastly, this technology could help children with mental disorders figure out why they feel the way they do and educate them about it, while also helping them not to feel that way anymore. Overall, this technology belongs in the classroom because it could solve problems that end up helping teenagers acedemics and result in opportunities to advance the child further."
10617,0,"Teachers can have a hard time telling if their students are ingaged and focused. Students can be disingaged and a teacher wouldn't know. With technology, such as teh Facial Action Coding Systm, teachers can see how their students are feeling about the classroom. They can see how they feel about the material they are learning and the work they are given. When a teacher is trying to find a new method to use when teaching, it can be hard to see how the students feel. They could like it or hate it. Most students like to keep their emotions to themsleves. Using this technology would give the teacher the oportunity to see how their class might feel about the material or lesson that they are trying ot teach. It can also show you if a student might be confused. There emotion will change and you can tell if they aren't understanding something going on in the class. In conclusion, his technology can change the way things are in the classroom. If a teacher can know how their students are feeling, they can improve the way they teach. If they improve the way they teach, students will be more ingaged. If studenets are more ingaged, then they are most likely to learn what is being taught and understand it."
13987,0,"Dear Principal, I believe community service should not be mandatory. Many students do sports or are in clubs and if you made it mandatory students would not have time for these activities. Students would probably blow off the community service anyway and do whatever they want. A third and final reason is that some community service takes long hours after school. If you will continue reading, I have more to say. Students would not have time for clubs if community service was mandatory. Some clubs or sports have a positive influence on students, such as meting new people. I was on the cross country team for three years in a row. I met some good friends there. If community service was mandatory then this would not exist and students would miss very valuable opportunities. Another example is that sometimes, clubs help the school. At my school we have the helping hands club. You can tell by the name that this club helps the school. This club would have no time after school and our school would not be the place it is today. Another reason is that some students would blow off the community service. This would mainly be the ones who did not do community service in the first place. In this scenario, there would be no point in making community service mandatory at all. I can pretty much guarantee that the ones who didn't do community service in the first place would not do it anyway. Besides, some students already help the community without calling it ""community service"". Some students do nice things for people but don't consider that community service. My third reason is that community service takes too long after school. When the average student gets home, all they usually think about is getting away from the stress at school. They don't want to get more work to worry about. Community service also might intrude on their sleep time too. If a student does community service right after school, they would then have to do their homework, sometimes students barely make it to bed with homework alone. If you threw in community service on top of that, image how little sleep students would get. Community service should be a choice, not mandatory. Sometimes students serve the community with the little things they do every day, like RELATIVE_NAME's challenge says. Clubs and organisations are important to a student too and with community service around there would be no time. Some students might not even do the service at all. And it takes too long which may result in sleep loss. I hope you take my views into consideration. Gratefully, Anonymous student."
22959,0,I think students should not be able to take classes at home. Because is not going to benefit them with their work. Sometimes students dont know how to do their assignment assigned. Students need to communicate with others to gain more experience. a lot of students needs help with one person to support them with their work. Some students are not smart enough to work by their-self. If students take classes at home they might have some issues. For example from my point of view I think students should come to school. Because is more helpful for them they get help from their teachers. They communicate with others share their thoughts. If their having problems with their assignment they can ask for help. however some students are not agree to come to school because they might not like to wake up early every morning or deal with others. Some students have bad attitudes and they dont like been with others or forced to talk. But it is more important to come to school because it benefits you gain more experience.
24993,0,"Making Better Choices Decision and choices are things we all have to make, but why can't they be easier? Asking one's opinion on something can shine a light on something that was once not thought of, they can also persuade you to a decision that they see fit, and if you ask multiple people, you can find the popular opinion. Starting off, shedding light on a new topic can be helpful because if you have never thought about this option, then it could help you come to a final verdict. Second, this thing that has been brought up, may show you why picking one of the choices could negatively impact you. It can also show you a different way of thinking. This thing can provide to you why something is a better choice than the other. Next, if someone can persuade you to an option, it can make the choice seem easier, as if it's not all on you. Now, when someone tries persuades you, they try to give you the option they think is right, and if you trust them and believe in them, they can lead you down the right path. If you believe in that persons choice, then it could make them think that you really trust them. My last reason, if you find several peoples opinion on one thing, you can find the popular opinion. Finding the popular opinion can show you what ever one thinks is a better choice. It can show you that you are making the right choice. The popular opinion of all these people can also show you why the choice you were making is wrong. If you chose the popular opinion, then it makes you feel confident that you have made the right choice. In conclusion, I think it is better to have multiple peoples opinions because it can show you something new, they can help you come to a decision, and they can show you the popular opinion."
15562,0,"Dear Principal: I am really against the rule, you can't participate in any sports or other activities without a B average as your grade. I think that the reason all of the students have C' s is because they are not in any sports or other activities. It is a proven fact that if you put a student in a sport or other activities, they will do better in school. So i think you should lower the bar to a 75% grade average and when they start doing better in school, raise it back up to having a B average. Also if that doesn't work then maybe you can talk to the student and the parents to see what going on. But I am sure that if listen to what i am saying, my idea will work. Many students struggle with school, so if you lower the average down so the students can do sports and other activities it can help them learn the stuff in school a different way for them to understand. But as soon as there grades go up and prove that they can keep them up then you can raise the grade average to a B. Also if you start out with a B average then many students might think that your saying there to dumb to do a sport or other activities. Next thing you know, there grades are dropping even lower. That is what I have to say about you trying to raise the grade average to early as B. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME"
3572,0,"Students are like baby chickens. They need a leader and proper guidance to ensure they prosper in life. Teachers can be and usually are that mother hen for their students. This applies to many circumstances whether it is in school, during the summer, or even after college. Planning projects in the summer, a perfect time for students to grow and expand their knowledge, is an area that most teachers are experts on. Some people may say projects given during the summer should be designed by the students. However, summer projects should be teacher-designed because students cannot be held accountable and need guidance. Summer projects should not be student-designed because students are not trustworthy. The majority of students will search for an easy way out and try to make the project as simple as possible. This is completely divergent to a teacher's mindset. They enjoy pushing students out of their comfort zone so they have a better chance to improve and grow. Students cannot be held accountable to design a summer project that will challenge their mind because of their lack of motivation. In addition, students are not responsible enough to be bestowed with the task of creating their own project. Without a doubt, they will prioritize relaxation and fun over learning and hard work, especially in the summer. As a repercussion, it is a waste of time for the student and teacher, since the student did not put forth their best effort. Some people may say students should create their own summer projects so they can take the initiative and learn to be independent. However, they are wrong because students cannot be held accountable for their actions due to their lazy mentalities. Teachers benefit from challenging students, which is why teacher-designed summer projects ensure that students continue to learn. Another reason teachers should design summer projects is because most students still need assistance and guidance. Teachers are more experienced in life and share their wisdom with children. Nevertheless, they know what activities and projects stimulate the brain and help students learn better. With this additional knowledge, they are better suited to plan and organize projects. For many students, their brain continues to develop and their pre-frontal cortex develops last. As a result, they rely on their amygdala, which is why they do not have the best decision making skills. When asked to create a project, some students do not know where to start because they need guidelines to accomplish a task. For this reason, teachers are always there to help and give guidance. They look out for their students and give encouragement because they want what is best for them. Many people say that schools should give students permission to design summer projects as a way to give them more freedom and allow them to express their creativity. Although, they are incorrect because students still need guidance since they do not have as much experience compared to adults and for the reasont that their brains are still developing. Clearly, summer projects should be teacher-designed due to the lazy mentalities and ongoing brain development of students. Children cannot be trusted to create their own project because they will not challenge themselves enough, especially compared to a teacher. Students still require guidance because their brain is still developing and teachers provide beneficial wisdom. It is essential that these projects stimulate the brain so student continue to learn over summer. Without a doubt, teachers should definitely create summer projects because if they didn't, students might be robbed of a prosperous future."
7288,0,"Why Everyone Should Have to do an Extracurricular Activity Have you ever thought of something that you might want to do outside of school, but you never got around to it? Well this new idea might help you and I will explain why this should become a rule. I think that everyone should have to do an extracurricular activity outside of school. There are plenty of reasons for this, starting with meeting new people. You could meet a whole different friend group than you are used to and really bond with them. Also, it could get your mind off something, whether it is fighting at home or being bullied at school. If you do a sport, it could help your body too. Maybe you're not happy with your appearance, weight, or strength, sports help them all. Maybe in your activity, you could help someone who is going through a tough time with family or bad grades or anything bad going on in their life. Lastly, you could learn new things like a new sport, a certain type of art, or even discover a new talent you never new you had. First off, doing an extracurricular activity helps in so many ways starting out with meeting new people. If you can go into someplace new and make a couple of friends, then you can be able to find a safe place with the new group so you don't have to feel like theres only a handful of people you can go to for advice or help or even just have a good time. Also, making new friends that you've never met before shows that you can work well with almost anyone and not just that handful of people. Next, it could help get your mind off something that is just not falling into place right now. Maybe you're not getting along with your parents, or a loved one died, or maybe you're even getting bullied at school. When doing an extracurricular activity, all of your fears and sorrows just drift away like you don't have a worry in the world and you can just be yourself. Sports can definitely help with this, because when you are running up and down the court and hitting a baseball as far as you can, all of the stress in your body gets let out and you feel free. This ties in with making new friends too, because your new friends can help you get your mind off that one thing that keeps bothering you. Especially sports help with this reason, because they help improve your entire body making you feel like a whole new you. Maybe your weight is a little above what you want it to be or your arms are too weak to lift a chair. Either way sports can help with this significantly. When you run up and down the court, it gets your blood flowing and moving at a higher speed helps you loose weight. In baseball, half of the game is throwing a ball, and in order to be able to throw it hard, you have to have arm strength. This should motivate you to work to make your arm stronger by lifting weights and doing band exercises. Also, playing a sport and making your body stronger will help make your bones strong so that if you fall on an arm lets say, its less likely to break and if it does, then it won't be severe. Relating to where I talked about the activity or a friend helping get your mind off something, you could also help someone else if they are in the same shoes as you. Maybe they are having even worse than you which might seem impossible, but it is a reality for so many people. The least you can do to help them, is be a friend to them even if they are not your first choice. Maybe the reason they are doing the activity is to find some help from someone like you. You never know what could be going on in someones life, so be that good teammate that passes the ball to them and show them how to draw something they didn't know how to. Last but not least, you could learn something about yourself or how to do something you never knew how to but always wanted to learn. I've always been a baseball and basketball player but maybe if we had to choose a new activity to do, then I could choose another sport like soccer or tennis. Maybe even, I could branch out and try something that's not a sport like art or possibly learn something that I could do that I never knew I could, like play guitar. That would be the beauty of the new rule, learning something new about yourself that could last you a lifetime and maybe even make you some money one day. Yes, these after school activities can take up a lot of your free time, but when you are doing/playing them, it should be so fun that it feels like it is your free time. But if you can come out of an activity with at least one new friend and some peace of mind it should all be worth the time. Myself, I have done many extracurricular activities in my life which include mission trips with church, boy scouts, sports, and many others. For instance, the past two years my mom and I have gone with the church to a mission trip in St. Lucia. This has probably been the most special activity to me, because we got to work with kids from the age of four, all the way through the age of fourteen. The St. Lucia trips were so special to my mom and I, that we are going to Slovakia this Summer to teach the kids and teenagers English. Also I never knew that I was good at basketball until about six years ago I joined a league and started playing and quickly realized that this was something that I'm good at and want to do the rest of my life. I started playing baseball when I was four. My mom signed me up for tee ball and I had so much fun that I wanted to play again. So I kept on playing and again, I realized that I was actually pretty good. Growing up baseball has been a key to my success and I have now played on many different travel ball teams and hopefully the middle school team this year. That would be a dream come true because I have worked my whole life for that. This goes to show how much joining an extracurricular activity can do for you. I will do everything in my power to help this rule that the principle has proposed to make this an actual rule so that kids at our school and others can enjoy ourselves."
751,0,"Cell Phones While Driving? Iphones, Galaxies, Google Pixel, etc. are all major cell phone models that people spend hundreds of dollars on to get the latest release. The cell phone is no longer a ""want"" but instead a necessity to everyday life. Children are introduced to phones at a very young age as a distraction, teens use it for social media and to stay up to date with the latest trends, adults use it for work and communication. However there's a problem, we just don't know how to put it down. While eating, while in class or at work, while you are doing anything a phone is in your possession. Unfortunately, we cannot even put phones down while operating a vehicle. Using a cellphone while driving has become a harmful habit to many and has had a negative impact on society. The usage of cell phones while driving should not be allowed because it causes accidents and deaths of others, makes you less aware of your surroundings, and it gets you pulled over. Seeing a car crash on the daily news due to a distracted driver is as common as seeing the weather man explain the upcoming forecast. Seems to have its own segment during the news broadcast. Cell phone usage while driving increases your chances of getting in an accident by four times. All it takes is a simple touch of the home button, answering a text, just the glance to your lap when it vibrates can cause you to run your car against another, potentially taking yours and others lives with you. According to the National Safety Council, using a cellphone while driving caused about 1.5 million car accidents in the United States. Not only that, U.S. Department of Transportation reports that this act kills about 3,000 to 6,000 people every year. Some of those are innocent people who have a family waiting for them at home, but unfortunately an irresponsible driver just had to answer a text message. People cannot understand that using your cellphones while driving not only impacts them but everyone else on the road. It has come to the point where Georgia has adopted a new law to make cell phone use out of your hands literally. The law makes it illegal to have a cellphone in your hand, hence the name hands-free. However the number of people still using their phones is pretty high. According to an article by AJC titled, ""Georgia's distracted driving law turns 1: Has anything changed?"" The State Patrol gave 22,327 distracted driving citations from July 1- May 31. It is still pretty soon to tell if the law has been a complete success but in its first year the number of fatalities in Georgia has dropped 2.2%. Just proving if people leave their phone alone while driving it would save the lives of all people in a car. On the other hand, many people believe that their phones are needed while they drive. They could come to great use in some occasions like using it for GPS or calling for an emergency. Thus making the point to keep cell phones, but this does not eliminate the consequences the phones causes. There are more consequences towards using your phone while driving than there are benefits. Car crashes and accidents tend to happen more often when there is a phone involved, even if you are using it to find your way around. Although there might be a few benefits to using your phone while conducting a vehicle, they should not be allowed while driving. Cell phones can have a detrimental effect on someone if they are used when in the driver's seat. The usage of a phone while driving can lead to accidents, citations, and the end of someone's life.

16154,0,"March 2,2011 Dear Principal, I, STUDENT_NAME an eighth graders of SCHOOL_NAME has heard of your considering changing school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless we have a B grade average. What you don't know is that many of us students have a C grade average. my point is that your changing our school policy might be unfair. Why, you might ask? there are many reasons why. TEACHER_NAME, if you were to change the school policy it might be difficult to maintain a B grade average because some of us students might have difficulties in one class and might need a little help in one lesson that they didn't understand. but that isn't a real reason to kick a person off the team, that is really unfair because maybe the sport or activity is what the person has passion for. Its like trying to take a bottle away from a baby when its hungry. I myself am very passionate about soccer, soccer is an active and painful sport but its what i love doing, just feel that rush of adrenaline run through your veins and being able to say ""I wona gold metal because I was in the forward."" Every person wants to complete this phrase ""I'm proud of myself because..."" Another reason why you shouldn't change the school policy is because doing sports isn't something you do to be active or to have fun. One does it because of the benefits that come from sports. Many girls enjoy figure skating because its not only a sport, its because they feel beautiful and graceful. Ever sport shows you how you can feel better about yourself. If you were to change school policy most students believe that they cant reach the standrad of having a B grade baverage"

Being responsible is a great thing to have to not forget and have the power of trust worthy,but how can it effect your skills of learning.

These evidence proves how NASA are trying different approaches and they are making different kind of new technology so they can withstand the harsh condition of Venus, and striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."
6258,0,"I think it would be fair to say that more than half of students at my school participate in some type extracurricular. Most schools offer a wide variety of extracurriculars to participate in from soccer to theater, or govenment, there are hobbies for whatever you would like to try! I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it helps kids find what they are interested in, a positive social activity, and supports a healthier lifestyle. One major reason I think all students should participate in an extracurricular is because it can ignite new interests. If you don't encourage kids to participate in extracurricular, how will they know what they are interested in? You never know if you like something until you try it. People who go into the NFL and NBA don't just show up one day and start playing, they found their intrest when they were younger and stuck with it. Many of our past presidents were involved with their school student government in high school. Students can get scholarship opportunities if they are very talented at their hobby. If they are enjoy that activity a lot, and are committed to what they are doing, it could possibly become their future career. Another reason all kids should participate in an extracurricular is because it's a good social activity. You take a look around my school you will notice kids who do sports or take part in band are more talkative and friendly. Joining a club or sport team would help students socialize with people they usually wouldn't talk to otherwise. Many kids bond with their peers they do that extracurricular with, making more friends. It can give people a sense of belonging. Lastly, extracurriculars support a healthier lifestyles. Having to do a sport or club would get more kids off their phones and outside their house, away from their beloved XBOX. With child obesity on the rise in the United States, it would'nt be a bad idea to have more kids exercise, whether its their body or mind! This would encourage more people to be involved in their school community, making kids probably like school more. It has been proven that the people who usually have better grades are the one who take part in a sport or club. Overall, everyone should join an extracurricular because of all of the benefits. I think all students should participate in a some type of extracurricular or some type of hobby, because it can ignite new interests in things kids might have thought they did'nt even like, create new friendships with people in their school community, and support a positive lifestyle!"
20103,0,"Dear Senator Marco Rubio, I feel America should keep the Electoral College. This method has worked and has been sussesful most of the time. Even though some say this system is unfair and outdated, their are many pros that keep this system alive. Overall, this system has certainly an outcome. A state can create a lanslide electoral-vote which in return will give a victory to the canadite. Many candidates that win the election have had a popular vote. Even though this system can have canadites that tie, its very unlikley that this will happen becuase of the number of votes. The Electoral College requires the canadite to have a trans-regional appeal. Each region doesn't have enough votes to elect a president. That is a good aspect of this system because many people could favor a canidate in a reign. Swing states are vital in an election. Voters in these states are more likely to pay attention to the campaign and know who to vote for. These voters are known to be the most informative and help decide the election. Some people say this sytem is not fit in America and voters say this is unfair. This sytem keeps key states informed and more attentive when it comes to election time. This system helps avoid a candidate to receive a majority of the votes. Voters in this sytem are ones who want to show there political prefrence. This system allows people to express themselves and also give the canadites a fair election for the most part. People such as Bob Dole say to abolish the Electoral College, which is wrong. There hasen't been any huge issues that have not made this system succesful. People have a say in this system by voting. We should indeed keep the Electoral College. Sincerily, PROPER_NAME"
4348,0,"Research indicates that students forget almost one-third of what they learned during the school year over summer. Without consistent reinforcement of learned material over the summer, students lose essential knowledge about concepts that are going to be built upon in the next school year. In response to that, schools have started to require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break to prevent minimal loss of information. These projects will allow students to retain knowledge and learn over the break so they are prepared for the next school year. The summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers are knowledgable about the information students need to learn, student-designed projects may lead them to do the project incorrectly, and students may not make their summer projects challenging enough to learn new concepts. Teachers are educated in their field of study and pass that knowledge to their students; they are aware of the information and requirements for students to know for the next school year. By having teachers design the summer projects, they can readdress concepts that students need practice with or struggled with last school year so they will not be troubled by it in the future. For example, in the book Counting By 7s, the main character excells at history. Although she excells in that subject, she has trouble with other subjects. A teacher-designed summer project for her may be focused on math and writing while her student-designed project would have been based on history, which may help her retain that knowledge, but does not help her with subjects she truly needs practice with. In addition, teacher-designed summer projects can have students learn new material that will be used in the upcoming school year. Teachers are aware of what will be taught in a course next whereas students are not. These summer projects would allow students to prepare ahead of time for the school year by reaffirming previous knowledge and learning new information directed towards the course. Many educational resources are only for teacher use or are not accessible to students prior to the school year, such as syallbuses and requirements for a course, Khan Academy, and other study sites, allowing teachers to be more effective in designing summer projects than students. Having the summer to complete teacher-designed summer projects will allow students to expand their knowledge on topics they need to learn or struggled with so they are prepared for the coming school year. If students were to design summer projects, they may be unintentionally flawed or incorrect because the students are not experts on the subject like teachers. Student-designed summer projects may allow students to express their creativity, but can ultimately lead them to learn the information incorrectly. Teachers are guides and resources for students to follow when learning information and asking questions. Frederick Douglass, a slave in the 1800s, became self-educated by looking at other students' papers and reading magazines and books. Although he helped himself become more knowledgable about the world through the new information he obtained, he learned some information wrong because he was not guided or corrected by teachers. Student-designed projects can be precarious because teachers cannot correct students if the project is designed inccorectly. If the project were teacher-designed, then the correct information will be present and learned by the students. The summer projects being flawed can also hurt students. By learning the information incorrectly, they are likely to repeat the same mistakes, making it harder to correct them. In the book Fish in a Tree, a girl with dyslexia struggled with writing because the words kept moving. She got into the habit of writing letters a specific way so that when a teacher noticed and corrected her, it was hard for her to stop the habit of writing letters incorrectly. Student-designed projects can give students the freedom to express their creativity through learning and designing, but this also allows for students to do their project incorrectly because they learned the material wrong, leading them to repeat the same mistakes because the teacher is not aware of how the students are designing their projects. Summer is the period of relaxation and taking a break from school for students. Giving the freedom of designing summer projects to students allows them to make the project easy to complete, preventing them from challenging themselves and learning new information through exploration of the project. Students can manipulate student-designed summer projects by creating a project that is not difficult to do, therefore not pushing or challenging them to learn new information. One example of this was demonstrated by a study of a homeschooled family in the Midwest. The parents gave their children the freedom of designing their own cirriculum for education based on their interests. Instead of centering their cirriculum and challenging themselves with subjects like algebra or chemistry, they studied games and did not necessarily learn anything. By having teacher-designed projects, teachers can challenge the students so they learn the new information about subjects for the coming year, which fulfills the requirements of learning over the break. Teacher-designed projects would challenge students to learn while student-designed projects can be made easy for the student to complete. Teacher-designed summer projects can prepare students for the coming year by addressing upcoming subbjects and topics students have previously struggled with. In addition, it prevents students from learning information wrong or doing the project incorrectly by giving them specific guidelines. These projects also ensures that students are challenged and learn new information. Teacher-designed summer projects would be more beneficial for students."

Several photographs of the face have been taken over the last 27 years. The photographs were all taken by Nasa's Jet Propulsion Labratory (JPL). The face on Mars was not created by aliens. Although it may look that way, the face is actually the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. The same landforms are common around the American West. In Cydonia, the area where the photographs were taken, butte's and mesa's are common. The Martian mesa has wierd shadowing on the top which, caused it to look like a face. If the Face on Mars was created by aliens it would be easy to tell, because ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters.""The refore making the image incredibly clear and making it easier for analyst to identify what the face actually is. Even if it was created by aien lifeforms hundreds of years ago, Nasa would not keep this a secret from the world. Because it would benefit them. And also if it was created by alien lifeforms and Nasa wanted to keep it a secret, why would they release the image in the first place. Therefore the Face on Mars is a naturally occuring land formation"
9996,0,"Even though technology is a huge part of the world today to help with certain problem and can be really helpful to people. The author describes the FACS or Facial Action Coding System as a technology to shows a recognition to facial movement. In today's society we know that its alot of emotions being shown throughout the world no matter what's the case is. For example, emotions are hidden by certain people or even people that don't show emotions at all. To support my claim is that no matter if parents or anybody tells them something they will not show any type of emotion any type of way, so they use equipment or something such as the FACS technology program. The author says that from using the FACS experiment that it will make you feel sightly happy. In my opinion that is not true because that when you are down or upset you wouldn't want to do a experiment just to make you feel happy because you would think the experiment was nonsense. The author also provided us with is that if you raises your eyebrowns when your suprises and around your mouth tightens your lips to show anger is true because the FACS could shows and tell your emotion at anytime and any place. When looking at the Mona Lisa painting it was sucessful and was one of Leonardo da Vinci's biggest accomplishment was the painting of Mona Lisa. Some of the new comptuer software that can recognize emotions, It was sucessful because the software is the latest innovation from Professor Thomas Huang of the Beckman Institute for Advance Science at the University of Illinois with collaboration with Professor Nicu Sebe Of the University of Amsterdam. Comparing school computer and FACS is that school computer can recognize if a students is bored, or even confused about a problem there doing on a website such as Mindplay, Khan Academy, Carnige Learning, and etc. The FACS is extermely helpful and useful is because the FACS materials can be expressive for video games or video surgery. It can also help with human communication that aew nonverbal including emotional communtication. By according to Dr. Huang notes he says "" So computers need to understand that too."". Your home computer or work computer cannot modify Mona Lisa smile. To support my claim is in pargraph 7 it says "" Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile. "" But you can write down some simple instructions that ""encode"" the different emotions. The author says in Pargraph 9 us that the FACS can give you happy face that it can acutally be useful. It can be false because a fake smile is when you mouth widen alittle bit with no teeth showing, and when using the FACS it can probably not show it. The FACS technology can be very helpful for counselor, teachers, deans, doctors and even more. When someone is mentally challenge or mentally disabled the counsleor can uses the FACS to identify the mental person emotions. It can be helpful with teachers and deans is to identify the different or emotion the child has. For examples, say a child is got bully in the cafeteria for his lunch money and he just walks out the cafeteria with a frown on his face and he doesn't want to show his emotion toward the dean and/or teacher so thats when they can used the FACS technology to figure out there emotions. The FACS is very helpful for humans that performs the same impressive ""calculation"" everyday. Of course, most of us can probably tell how a friend is feeling by the look of there face, you can probably tell by the look of there faces when they are happy, sad, worried that why Lenardo da Vinci made the Mona Lisa picture and his crew from making the FACS technology. The author is giving us the mood of encouraging because without the FACS technology then we would never know how people feel when it comes down to the people that don't show emotions. In conclusion, FACS is very useful in many different sceranio. If it wasnt for the FACS technology then we wouldn't know how kids,adults,students,teachers and etc feel. Another thing is that the FACS technology is very helpful because that it can tell if a student is bored, and/or even tired. While a regular computer can tell if the student is bored. I would reccomend this in schools,hostipals, doctors office, or even in the dentist area."
4026,0,"Some schools assign summer projects for students to finish before the next school year comes around. The purpose of this work is to push the student to grow and learn on their own time. For example, teachers give book assignments where the student must read, then write an essay about the book. The topic of the summer project may be interesting to some, but cause other students to hate the work. Teacher designed summer projects should not be permitted and forced onto students. One reason that teacher-designed summer project should not be permitted is that, teachers don't know if the topic they chose will interest everybody. Students know what they themselves enjoy, so why force them to do somehting they may hate. When teachers assign summer projects its interrupts, and steals, the break that students need and deserve over the summer. If the project were chosen by the student then the subject would be something of their interest, and the project wouldn't be seen as such a nuisance. A students main priority during the summer should be to have fun. If a student enjoys the topic that they chose for their project then it wouldn't be interrupting the break, they well deserve, it would just be adding to it. For example, instead of reading, ""Lord of the Flies,"" students should be able to pick a book on a topic they as an individual enjoy. Another reason that teacher-designed summer project should not be permitted is that, students dont have the time or energy for it. Students who were just learning how to write essays a few years back are now getting jobs and paying bills. Those students, society believes to be little children, are now working twelve hour shifts. As a student, with a job and bills to pay, work is very consuming of not only time but also energy. If a student does not have the time or energy for the project then nothing will get done. But if a student is allowed to pick their own topic then they will make time for it. People make time for things they like, for example, intimate relationships, sports, and friends. Student-designed summer projects would encourage the student to do finish their work, knowing that its something they enjoy. Although some believe that if the summer project is student-designed then they wont learn anything or grow, but they are wrong. No mater what topic or subject is chosen for the summer project, or for anything in life, there is always something more that a person could learn and gain from it. Students know what they like, so they can chose the topic but in the end its still a project and its something the students must put work and thought into, pushing them to grow. When the project is student-designed the person doing the project would have more motive to finish the project well and learn even more on the topic, than if a teacher designed the project. Having the students interest in a summer project could make them want to learn more, instead of forcing them into more stress. Each student is unique and likes different things. Schools should stop pushing them complete things that they dont like or understand. One way schools could fix this is by assigning a paper two months before the end of the school year asking for a detailed explanation of what the student wants to do for their summer project. The school or teachers could pick the way that they want the project ot be done but allow the student to chose the topic. By letting them chose the topic of the summer project it would help the students feel less stress and allow them to enjoy their summer while continuing to learn and grow."
3507,0,"Many schools around the country design and assign summer projects for students to complete over the summer break. This is help students continue to learn and keep their brains active during summer break. Summer assignments also help students prepare for their incoming classes by learning concepts before the year starts. To better benefit the student, summer assignments should be teacher-designed because teachers have more knowledge of the course curriculum and many students need a teacher who can lead them through new concepts of the class. Summer assignments are designed to help students maintain an active mind and prepare for their upcoming classes by learning course concepts before the school year starts. Teachers are trained for years to master the subject they are going to teach and mostly likely have already seen or learned the material in the class they are going teaching. Students do not know the course curriculum before they have taken the class. If the summer assignment was designed by the students, the assignment would not be as beneficially because students do not know what the curriculum of the class is. For example, in classes I have always been give assignments created by my teachers. But, one class my teacher gave us an open ended project where students could create their own project using our ideas. All the kids in my class took weeks and even months to find an idea for their project. The students in my class had no idea what the teacher was looking for and how to correlate their ideas into the class curriculum. However, a teacher already knows the curriculum. This will allows for a more efficient and beneficial way of learning for the student because the teacher can create assignments they know is related to the course. Not only do student not know the course concepts, students also do not have the skills to create assignments; students need a teacher leader to guide them through the new class. When learning a new concept, students can become overwhelmed if they do not understand the topics. At my school, some classes have very little guidance from teachers to help the students understand a new topic. My friends in these classes become very overwhelmed and become more apathetic to the class. Students do not understand how to learn a new without the guidance of a teacher. A teachers job is to create assignments, tests, and projects to lead their students towards mastering a concept. When teachers create assignments they are more involved with guiding their students. If summer assignments were student-designed there would be a lack of guidance compared to an assignment made from a teacher would have. This would causes students to inefficiently learn through summer assignments. People who support student-designed summer assignments may argue that advanced placement (AP) classes require students to learn from textbooks without the guidance of a teacher so students do not need teacher guidance. But when taking a look at the students in these AP classes, on average students in AP classes struggle and receive poor grades in these classes. This is due to the lack of teacher leadership in these classes. Students in AP classes do not get enough guidance to fully understand the curriculum. Summer assignments should be teacher-designed because teachers have more knowledge on the course curriculum and students need teacher guidance while learning new concepts. Summer assignments would be more effective if the teachers created the assignments themselves. Summer assignments that effectively teach students the curriculum over summer break will help benefit the students during the school year."
212,0,"Required Essay: Phones & Driving There are many reasons why drivers should not use cell phones while driving vehicle. First of all, it can be very dangerous using cell phones while driving. Because when you use cell phone you get distracted with other things you are doing and things around you. When you are driving your focus should be in driving not in your phone or in any other things. There are high chances of you getting into an accident. Furthermore, getting in an accident that might really affect your bank balance and you don't want that. For example, when you hit a car in accident and if it's your fault you have to pay for that person's car repairing and for that person's medical also your insurance will go higher. That will really affect your bank balance. Lastly, I have seen and read most of the people who gets in an accident they are teenagers. Teenagers they keep using phones and driving in the same times that's how most of that accident happens. If you don't care about your own life there is more people who cares about you especially your parents. So at least Think about them before doing something. So there are my top three reasons why no one should use phones while driving."
1134,0,"Should drivers be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle? Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating. Reasons why are because far too many accidents have occurred because of texting and driving. If a driver uses a device while driving it limits their ability to operate the vehicle. Its equally important to have your mind free of distractions while driving. Each day in the United States approximately 9 people are killed and over 1,000 people were injured due to a distracted driver. Even bluetooth devices shouldnt be used while driving. The brain tends to use a lot of its visual processing abilities. Talking on the phone may seem to need the use of only your ears, but your ears send a signal to a part of your brain that creates images which is why when your talking on the phone you picture that person in your mind. For example someone asks you a question over the phone, like where did you put the tape? You'll imagine the last place you put it. These are my reasons and good reasons why drivers should not be able to use cellular devices in any capacity while operating a vehicle."
11365,0,"Imagine having a piece of technology tell you how you're feeling. I do not think that the use of technology to read our emotions would be valuable in a classroom. If they were used, the students may get mad, it could be a bother to the teacher, or it would be costly and takes regular upkeep. If technology was used in classrooms, it would not be valuable. The students in the classrooms sometimes want to hide how they feel about someone or something, and having a machine track what they feel, could trigger them. A student can sometimes hide their anger about a student or assignment, but if this was applied, it would be obvious. Another reason they wouldn't be valuable is because if it reads the wrong emotion of someone, they person's anger or emotion may rise and become an even larger ordeal. Someone can already tell what is felt just by looking at someone's face for the most part, as the author stated in paragraph 5, so there is no point to have to have a machine do the same thing. A friend would be also able to see if you are faking a smile or hiding what you really feel. The teachers also are another reason they wouldn't hold any value. A second reason that the machine is not worth it is because of the teachers responses. A teacher may now see how a student feels about something and this could lead to more disiplinary issues. The teacher may feel annoyed if the students become amused and there would not be a point to teaching. In paragraph six, it says, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" and this shows that they are becoming like a teacher and this could lead to a decrease in available jobs, kind of like what is happening with robots. The placement of these machines in classrooms could cause more stress on teachers and more to worry about on top of the student's needs. They aren't only a bad idea because of the teachers and students, but also the upkeep. The final reason they should not be placed in classrooms is because of the price and upkeep. The machines would not be a cheap purchase and the schools have better items to buy for the school. The school my have to hire more people to make sure they are always working and this is also using more of the schools money. The device would be like any other piece of technology and would also require updates. The ""Da Vinci Code"" would not be totally accurate every time, and that could lead to a disruption. Nick D' Alto says, ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" which shows how complicated the machine is and how easily it could misinterpret emotions. In conclusion, the placement of technology in classrooms would hold no value. They would be a distraction to students, have negative effects on teachers, and entail a large cost and major upkeep."
10587,0,"In order to detect human emotions these students are saying thrie computer can do it. I dont believe this and i'll tell you why. Computers can tell you how u fell on the outside but can't tell you about the inside. Emotions are not based on facial expressions. I can smile through pain but the computer won't tell you that. Many people cause decive you with there emotions. The person who created this only uses six basic emotions that can decive you on the outside. Explaining human emotions are very difficult because you cant actually tell how they feel on the inside. The emotions the show on the outside could decive how you see things. You should take the time to ask the person how they really feel after you get the results to see how accurate the computer really is. This computer cause not actually help these researchers. Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional coomunication. With this being said i do not believe any computer in the 21st century is advanced enough to read true human emotion. Maybe one day somebody will invent the greatest computer ever. But as of right now emotion truly can't be read unless the person themselves actually tells you."

Not everybody has the time to do community service. some people have homework to do and others have families that they have to help or deal with like there brothers and sisters. Not everyone has the time some people have the time but not everyone. I don't think that students should be required to do community service not only that but some people have more important things to worry about than community service. I'm not saying that its a bad idea or any thing like that. Just that some people don't have the time to do community service. Other people may have the time but I know that not every student has the time to do community service.

25245,0,"Have you ever needed advice and one person is not enough to help you so you should for sure have multiple people giving you advice it would surely be enough to help you. I believe that people should have multiple people helping them because they can give you better advice because they so much ideas that different people have. Therefore, you should for sure ask for more people to give you advice If before you only asked one person. I say that because of these three reasons They can give new ideas, you can make better choices, and there is different points of view. One reason that you should ask more people for advice is because they can give you more and new ideas. I say that because if theres different people with different minds then others they can surely give you and idea you never thought about. I know this because it happened to me before I was very mad because my parents did not buy me a toy. Then I asked many different cousins of what should I do to get that toy and many said be good or others said just dont get it and that gave little me so much to think about that I never even thought of before so that helped me because I got much more things to think about then just constantly wanting that toy. Also even researches say that 80% of people who ask for advice to many people get better outcomes. There is no reason for you to only ask one person if you get so much good things to ask more. The second reason I say that multiple advice is better then only one is that you can make better choices. Lets say that you need help on what to spend your allowance on and you have two things that you like but you can only get one. Would you want one person to help you with deciding which one to get or multiple people giving you feedback so you can make a good choice. If you would only want one person to help you let me tell you why thats not a good choice they could easily think for what they would love to have and not what you would love to have. For example lets say the two things is a dog and a cat they could easily be a dog person and just say dog but if there was multiple people they would give you reasons on why you should get the dog. Even research that a lot of scientists have found that is that 75% of people who ask for multiple people for advice makes better choices. The final reason on why you should ask multiple people for advice is that there is more points of view. This is a lesson that I learned before too because this has happened to me before. One time I was devastated that my parents would not let me play video games. Eventually, I asked my parents themselves on why i'm not allowed to play video games and they said think about it this way what if you were the parent would you let a child that has school tomorrow and it is passed his bedtime play video games while he has not been on his best behavior. That gave me so much made me learn so much things the whole time I was looking from my point of view while I should have been looking from both of my parents point of view. In conclusion sometimes one opinion can be better then one if the one person knows you very well. Although, in most cases more minds is better then one. Those three reasons clearly show that multiple people giving you advice is better then only one. Therefore, the next time you need advice try asking more then one person it could seriously make a difference. There is literally no reason on why you should ask one person for advice if you ask a lot more it can't make things worse for you it can only make things better for you."
7569,0,"Have you ever been bored at home wishing you had something to do? Extracurricular activities could be the solution you're looking for. A daily occurrence that happens to students and myself is that at some point you end up texting your friends because you're bored school can help change that. Extracurricular activities that students can participate in are Sports,Student Council,and Yearbook. Sports are a big part of schools all around the world since it has many advantages. One thing that sports can help in is helping students stay active throughout the day. Doctors recommend staying active because the body becomes stronger and healthier. Another benefit,believe it or not, is that Sports can help students work better together. People say theres no I in team thats because in order for a group of people to come together they need to improve they're teamwork to be successful. This extracurricular activities is suitable for many people because of the variety of sports that there are. It takes time for someone to find what they like to do,but because of all the choices students can try different sports until they find one that they enjoy best. One thing that I like about sports best is that they have endless opportunities for you to enjoy yourself. If Sports isn't your thing you can try Student Council it also has many things to offer. In Student Council you have the chance in meeting new people all the time. The council requires you to work and talk to many people to help better the school and other students daily lives. As you grow older you'll acquire many life skills all student council will do is improve those skills to better prepare you for the next chapter in your life. Think of student council as an office they both have similar ways of running and getting work down the only difference is that they're on different scales. The thing about student council is that they do many things but a big role they play is helping others. The council does many projects to help students and the community like donating,holding fundraisers,and community service. Student Council plays a big role in school,students,and the community if you're the type of person that enjoys helping others Student council is just for you! On the other hand many people say that an extracurricular activity takes your time away or is a waste of time. The reason for this is that many activities are held after school instead of school hours. However this is not true,nor correct,because extracurricular activities were not designed to take and waste students time. Students will be able to still be able to enjoy and relax during their free time. This is because the activities only take away a small portion of a students daily life plus there are some activities that are held during school hours like yearbook allowing students to take it as a class. Every school has a wide range of clubs or activities,so that all the students can choose one to their liking that way they can enjoy it other then having to take something they have no interest in doing. Taking a extracurricular activities has many good outcomes and benefits from helping students improve their skills to allowing them to enjoy themselves and have fun. Taking part in a club affects everybody in a positive form it also is a good way for students to be more productive while having fun."
22646,0,"Many school have offered students the option to work from home, do you think that's a good idea? Here's why its not. Many students need hands on help not only for them to understand the subject but for them to learn it properly. Also students may or may not have access to online learning maybe they live to far or have not so good service to communicate. Schools also help teach students how to interact with other, teaching them good social habits Most students need one on one help understanding the concept of the subject being taught. For example, math is known to be a hard subject if not taught properly, so if you were to work from home there would be a lot of confusion and questions unanswered. When in schools students can get as much help as they need, get questions and concerns answered and understand better. Some students actually would rather stay in schools where everything such as text books, Wifi, paper, and pencils are supplied for them. Students who live off grid or to far to get service would have a tough time getting information on the subject. For illustration, more then 15% of students live in wooded areas, hills and mountains with barely any service, just imagine the struggle of finding the right spot to sit in for about seven in a half hours. Some schools think having students work from home is a good idea, but not realizing most students require extra help or they just dont have the connection to do the work. Not to mention that school actually teach more then they know like social interaction. Students should stay in schools to learn."
10750,0,"Computers don't have emotions, but you do! Imagine technology that seriously works for you, not only at home but also in the classroom! If technology could accurately read human facial expressions the learning possibilities could be endless. For example, think about that one story that you're forced to read that you just can't understand and brings out all your frustrations, with facial expression recognition you probably will never be so frustated again. The use of technology to read the emotional expressions of the students in a classroom is unbelievably valuable. Technology in the classroom has already begun to advance rapidly with educational websites such as; Google Classroom, Edulastic, Khan Academy,and Mathia. The facial recognition technology could enhance a students comprehension to maximum potential. In the passage "" Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author states in paragraph 6 line 6,""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,""Dr Huang predicts.""then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor."",this kind of technology can possibly boost testing score and even help children falling behind instead of holding them back another year. The text also states in paragraph 6 line 10 that;""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communcation,""notes Dr. Huang."". This example actually explains alot of real world issues in the classroom, such as the fact that some students refuse to even try to communicate their confusion or boredom in the classroom so then they often disengage in the lesson and miss every part that would be essential to reaching standards created by the state. Many parents or administrators may not agree that this sounds real or possible, but the logic is right before our eyes. In the text the author states how the technology performs the task of reading emotional appeals. For example, in paragraph 3 line 1 the author says,""The process begins when the com puter constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit"". So apparently this process goes beyond just looking at the face,but actually looking for the movements in facial muscles. The author also talks about the muscles that present certain emotions such as the; the muscles above your eyes (frontalis oars lateralis) raise when you're surprised,the muscles around your mouth (orbicularis oris) tightens your lips when you're angry, and more. This shows that the computer breaks facial expressions down to a science. So now what do you think? Computers advance more and more everyday, however facial recognition may just be the beginning. Learning in classroom has become based on all technology in many different forms. Facial tachnology will broaden our horizons with better test scores and happier students that can understand the material evn better than before! The use of technology to read the emotional expressions of the students in a classroom could be a life changing improvement in the 21st century since every student has different wants and needs as far their education."
17032,0,"When it comes to knew things in technology usually everyone jumps on the bandwagon but in some cases you shouldn't just because others will. When it comes to your safety and peace at mind you should make careful decisons of what potential danger you might be putting yourself in, especially when others are involved. When it comes to driverless cars I stand on the opposing side. I don't think driverless cars are a good idea because they can be costly, dangerous, and give people the impression that you don't need to know how to drive. These smart cars can be very costly when you think about it. Driverless vehicles are new to the world, with new technology come new bugs and manufactoring errors. For example, one day you could be ""driving"" down the street and one of your sensors don't go off and you run into something. Thats money out of your pocket to fix the damage of your car and whatever or whoever you hit. Depending on how bad it is it can even cost you a lawsuit and medical expences. Even if they do find a bug in your car you're still expected to pay for a replacement and whatever you hit. Smart cars can also be very dangerous. It is mentioned that there are several occassions where human service is needed in case of work zones and around car accidents. In the event that you might not be paying attention you could potentially run into a work zone or car accident. These are only two things but these two things can still be dangerous and even life threatining under certain circumstances. Last but not least driverless cars can put new drivers under the impression that you don't neccissarily need to know how to drive. This is putting other drivers at risk as well. Teenagers and adults with driving permits that try to drive the car will think they don't need to be as aware as they would in a regualr car. Without that sense of alertness in case of an accident or malfunction a person might not know what to do or how to operate the car. Overall I think that it is a bad idea to have driverless cars because they can be costly, dangerous, and give new drivers the impression that they don't need to know how to drive."

I disagree with this because theres a ton of stuff this would effect. firstly it would be a giant hassle for anybody who has daily afterschool plans or has to do something because they would get in trouble for not going. Then it would be another giant hassle for people who do activities outside of school because then the school will think he's not doing them and then he'll get in trouble. Another group of people it would be a giant hassle for is babysitters if you have to watch a little sibling after school or babysit for someone it would make it so you couldn't babysit. Another giant group of people it would effect is kids with afterschool jobs because they or their family might need that money but instead of working a job they have to work on the yearbook. Then another group of people this would effect is student all of them, think about it what student wants to stay at school instead of relaxing at home. every students schedule would get changed by this and it would disrupt and change the community time schedule because now stores and fast food places that usually get alot of student customers when the school day is over will now get little to none. So i really do think that this little change that the principle is making can change the schedule of the town. Then another persons schedule that would change is Parents' schedule because if they have to pick their kid up at a later time then, that would mean groups of people coming at the same time which would cause a ton of traffic so then it all combined together will make it so stores have less Customers other than students and it will be harder to get around for the whole town. So in conclusion let me know what you think whether we should be forced to do school activities after school or if we can do our jobs. If you agree with me stand up to your principle if they do force you to do afterschool activities then write a persuasive essay like i did. and you dont know but it might just change his mind about it.

13752,0,"Dear principal, I think students should be required to do community service acts for bad behavior, disrespect and misconduct. I feel that the students who are irresponsible and disrespectful should learn to control themselves by doing community service and i think this will also teach them their lesson so they will behave. Another thing is that i do not feel its okay to have everyone do community service because if you can control you actions you shouldn't be punished. Also if a student is not doing well in school they should be able to do community service for extra credit or just so they have another helpful act to put on an applications for jobs, schools and more. I think if a student gets caught fighting or bullying others they should do a service act that has to do with people, or if they get caught stealing they should do something for a charity event, or if they get caught littering they should go gather up all of the trash from some place like the park, road-side, or near by pond. If the student should refuse their assigned act i think the student should be suspended for a day. then when they return they should give a hand-written or oral apology to whoever the act of misconduct was committed toward."
7670,0,"Have you ever done something you never thought you would do? In fact I actually have. I participated in a activity I didn't think I was good at. I agree that students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity like playing sports, work on the yearbook, and join the student counsel. These are activities that students would probably be interested in if they just participated. Reasons being that they would be more active, they could figure out a new hobby, and they could meet new people. My first reason why I agree with this decision is because student would be more active. Some students now just like to stay home and be on their phone all day or watch television. I think that it isnt healthy because they arent keeping themselves active by just staying home all day. For example I used to stay home all day everyday, but now I play on a soccer team and it keeps me healthy, active, and happy. I enjoy what I do, and I think that students should be able to have that same feeling. It dosen't have to be a sport that they play, but it can at least be something to keep them active and entertained. My second reason is because students would be able to discover new hobbies. They could discover new things like playing sports, joining student council, and even working on the yearbook. There are many activities to choose from and students just have to get out of their comfort zone and figure out what best fits them. For example when I first started playing soccer I didn't think it was going to be fun for me, but then I started getting more into it and then I realized it was now a hobby for me since I liked it so much. And now I love going to the field with my dad whenever I don't have practice. My last reason is students would be able to meet new people. Meeting new people can either go good or bad. At first glance a person may look very nice, but then they turn out being mean or disrespectful. Or you could look at someone that looks mean, but then you realize they are the sweetest person. For example when I went to a new school I didn't know much people, and I looked over at this girl that had a face that made her look mean. I was nervous to go talk to her because I thought she was going to be rude, but turned out she is like a best friend and the nicest person I've ever met. Thats why students shouldn't assume about a person based on looks because they are not always right. But definitely participating in different activities will give students the chance to meet new people. To come to a conclusion, I agree that students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. My reasons being they would be more active, meet new people, and be able to find a new hobby. I hope that students become more interested in this decision."
8138,0,"There are many factors that makes Venus a very challenging planet for humans to study. Although Venus is the closest planet to Earth, there are many risks that have made it a very challenging place to examine more closely. Venus is the second planet from the sun which makes it very hard to achieve missions. All of the previous missions were unmanned because no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. In the article ""The Challenging of Exploring Venus,"" the author supports his claim that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by telling the reader about Venus's thick atmosphere, NASA's possible solution to Venus's hostile conditions, and all of the forms of light that it cannot penetrate. Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite a challenge it presents, like Venus's thick atmostphere. The planet's surface and the atmospheric pressure is much more greater than what people experience on Earth. The temperature is so much greater that it would crush a submarne. Paragraph 3 states, ""Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun."" There are too many risks from this planet being the hottest planet in the solar system, for people to explore it. It wouldn't be safe for people to experience this incredibly hot planet. Another challenge that studying Venus brings to the reader, is NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus. Vehicles would be hovering miles above the landscape to avoid the ground conditions by staying up and out of the way. Paragraph 5 states, ""At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth."" It could be very dangerous with people many miles above the surface, along with the termpature very high. Although it's survivable for humans, it's still very dangerous. Another challenge that studying Venus brings to the reader is all of the forms of light that it cannot penetrate. Since the light isn't penetrating the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography effectively, people only receive limited insite on ground conditions on Venus. People have to look at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet to even get a little bit of insight. Paragraph 6 says, ""Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks."" Since researchers can't take samples of things like gas, or rocks from a distance, they are working on innovations that would allow their machines to last long enought to help with their knowledge of Venus. Studying Venus has many challenges to go along with it. Although studying this planet is a worthy pursuit, some dangers were presented by telling the reader about Venus's thick atmosphere, NASA's possible solution to Venus's hostile conditions, and all of the forms of light that it cannot penetrate. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system which makes it hard for people to explore it if the pressure is so high. Vehicles hover miles above the landscape to avoid the ground conditions by staying up and out of the way. Since it's so hard to get close the Venus because of its risks, people have to look at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet to even get a little bit of insight. Although there are many dangers that come with exploring Venus, people get so much out of the result if researchers get to exploring what they needed to, to inform the rest of the people."
11595,0,"I think that the Facial Action Coding System is a great idea. It can have it's pros and cons but I think that the pros overdue the cons. Three reasons why I think it's a good idea is because it tells you how someone might be feeling, if they are lying about how they feel or not, and that if they don't want to tell you, you can figure it out. First of all, do you ever wonder on how might one person might be feeling? I bet you have. using the Facial Action Coding System can help with that. It can be hard because if you really care about someone and you might wonder how they are feeling. You can ask but what if they don't want to talk about it because it makes them uncomfortable. Second of all, what if you ask a friend on how they are feeling and they say they are fine, but clearly they are't. People can lie about how they are feeling. They might show something but deny they are feeling some type of way. Lastly, what if they don't want to tell you but you really want to know so you can help. the system can help with that. It would be much easier because now you don't have to ask and make them feel moe of what they are feeling. In conclusion, I think that the Facial Action Coding system is a really great idea. It would probably take a long time for mostly everyone to have that system. But in the future there will be some type of system like that, that everyone can afford and have."
10399,0,"In a class room situation it would be so amazing to be able to see how everyone is feeling and how they feel about a certain subject. So, As a example if you used this system in a math class you could give out equations and make the students solve them. Another way this could be used is if you put it in a musical classroom and let the students play music would the music have a effect on the students emotions? I think a amazing place to put this system would be in the cafe during lunch periods just to see what the effect of food does to the students. So, In a math situation where you give students equations to solve and see what their emotions are about the equations it would be great to know how well they feel about the problems. So, If the students where sat down for a hour and a half with a math problem and where confused the system could alert the teacher and the teacher could provide extra help. While in a musical classroom we could see what the effects of a musical piece has on students to see if musical classes are worth keeping in school systems. In lunch periods where we get to talk to all our friends and relax seeing what kind of emotions that adds to a students day could be really helpful. I think overall adding a system like this into a classroom situation would be very helpful. As long as it was accurate it could help students out a lot more and provide better grades over all. Also, This system could be used a teachers asssistant and help the teacher know who needs help. These are some reasons I think adding a system like this into a school enviroment would be very helpful."
6292,0,"Imagine this: You are an adult looking back at your schooling experience. Were you in any clubs? If you were, chances are you have fond memories of that time. However, does that mean extracurricular activities should be required at school? Many people have strong opinions on the topic. Extracurricular activities should be required. One reason why clubs should be required in school is that being in a club provides skills that are extremely helpful throughout life. According to Brian Scott, an expert on youth development at the University of Social Sciences, extracurricular activities in school are some of the best ways that the youth can prepare to enter the working world. Scott explains that this is true because after school activities give kids further experience with important skills such as communication and team work. Furthermore, a study conducted by the Department of Youth Development found that 87% of adults who participated in extracurricular activities in school thought that being in an extracurricular activity gave them skills that helped them later in life. One possible reason why extracurricular activities could have helped people after they have completed their schooling experience is that it gave them important skills and character traits such as perseverance or good communication. All things considered, extracurricular activities give those who participate quality life skills. Another reason why after school activities should be required is that it gives the participants helpful experience. Evidence for this is found by the University of Statistics who conducted a study that found that 76% of people who were a part of extracurricular activities during their school experience thought that the experience from those clubs is helpful to them in their careers. Some ways that clubs can help in careers is it can give students experience in their chosen career path. Examples of clubs that are best at providing experience specific to future careers is the math club where students can participate in competitions or the newspaper club where students can practice for journalism. The experience students gain from joining extracurricular activities in school can also be helpful when applying to colleges, if students choose to go down that route. According to the board of applications for the prestigious College of Law, one of the top things they look for in an application is what extracurricular activities the applicant participated in while in school. One member even said, ""I value extracurriculars even more than the grade point average when I am decided who gets in."" As you can see, the experience gained from clubs in school has many benefits including college and job applications. Another reason why extracurricular activities can be beneficial to students is that it gives students an opportunity to make new friends with similar interests. The Department of Youth Statistics stated that one of the best ways for students to make friends is by letting students choose what activities to do and pairing those with similar interests together. That is exactly what clubs do. Furthermore, it is proven by the University of Psychology that when students have a healthy amount of friends, they are less likely to fail their classes and more likely to succeed. Based on that, extracurricular activities can cause students to be more successful than their peers who do not partake in those activities. However, some people argue that students should be able to choose whether or not they want to participate in extracurricular activities in school. They cite people such as Jessica Grant, a professor from the West Virginia University of Psychological Studies, who said, ""when people have a choice in what they do, they tend to feel the benefits much more than those who are forced to do something."" While that might be true, students who are required to participate in at least one extracurricular do have a choice in what club or clubs they join. That choice is explained well by Dr. Matthew Brown, a professor of psychology at the University of Washington State who said, ""even when students are required to participate in something -- either a class or an activity -- they still always have some sort of choice, whether that is what activity to do or what mindset to have."" Using both sets of logic previously stated, when the students choose what club to participate in, they will experience the largest amount of positive results. All in all, a requirement in schools should be extracurricular activities. Clubs give students important life skills and experiences, as well as new friends. If clubs are required, then young adults would be much more prepared to transition out of school and in to the working world."

I believe this because now and days you see that a lot of car accidents happen with texting and driving and also with drinking and driving. Now imagine how great it would be if those types of accidents would stop happening, well driverless cars are the answer. Now and days people can be very irresponsible and hurt others by their actions but these cars can help save lives and a lot of them. This can help keep pedestrians safe and even the drivers. Many deaths happen every year because of drivers not being able to be alert when driving, well with this type technology we can prevent this from happening. These cars will most likely be programmed to follow the law, as in mainting the speed limit and not doing illegal things on the road as in skipping a stop sign or a red light. These cars will also be able to help those who aren't able to drive like blind people, short people, and handicaped people these cars will be able to take them to their destination safely. These cars will be a great help to a lot of people who are irresponsible and to those with disadvantages. In conclusion I do believe they should develop these cars because it would be a great help to people."
20478,0,"We should get rid of the electoral college because with the electoral college when we vote we aren't actually voting for the who we want to take over as president of the United States. We are voting for electors that help to elect the president. Under the electoral college system, voters do not vote for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. Therefore, many of us could be dissapointed by the outcome of who has been elected. For example if you wanted to elect John Kerry, you would vote for 34 democratic electors pledged to John Kerry. I believe we should just stick with popular vote for the president because then it is only fair. We would vote and which ever political leader got the most votes is the one who takes over in office. Who pick the electors in the first place? depending on the state, sometimes state conventions, state party's central committee, and sometimes even the presedential candiates themselves. Also, voters can't control who their electors vote for and they get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. The single best argument against the electoral college is that it is called the disaster factor. The electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winner-take-all system in each state. its official the electoral college is unfair, outdated and irrational. Some people may argue that we should keep it because of 1.) The certainty of outcome 2.) Everyone's president 3.) Swing states 4.) big states and 5.) Avoid run-off elections. It is argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate that has no hope of carrying their state. Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president was picked by poular vote. Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee...however it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. The Electoral College is widley known as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by delcaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner. The Electoral College method is not Democratic in a modern sense...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate your actually voting for a slate of electors. Perhaps there is a tie in the electoral vote, then, the election would be thrown to the House of Representives, where state delegations vote on the president. If thats the case then i definetley think we should overthrow the Electoral College because then the election is now in their hands which means we have no control over who is elected at all, it is an unfair process that needs to be taken care of. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe. Consider that state legislators are technically responsible for picking electors, and thos electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to kennedy. In the same vein, ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. Over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. Yet, the Electoral College still has its defenders. Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. Now that i have made my point, I would like to add that my opinion isn't the only one that matters but I am positive there are plenty of other people around that agree with my decision. I believe that we should overthrow the Electoral College because it is the most unfair way of voting for our presidential representive and we have no way of controlling it."
13653,0,"To the Principal, Community service is a very important thing to do. It is the act in which you are giving back to the community which houses you and your family. After all, if no one does community service, the whole town would be a mess. So students should be required to complete a set amount of community service based on their capacity to be able to help. Many students who go to the elementary probably lives quite close to it. The majority most likely grew up in the same place that they live now. This would mean that they would have benefited off of the people in the past keeping the place clean. It only makes sense for a receiver of free services to return the favour in one way or another. When required to do community service, students can help pick up garbage or plant flowers to make the overall cleanliness of the community better. Students can also volunteer to help out with the school itself in thanks for the education received from going there for free. Students will be able to show gratitude and improve the community through community service. Although most students may live close to the school some may live farther away and even out of the community itself. These students may not want to help out as they do not owe the community much but still attend the school. They shouldn't have to help out the community because they aren't a part of it. In addition some students may just not be able to comply from a physical injury or a disability that impedes them from helping out. They should be accounted for and excused from doing so. In most cases however, students should be able to do something even if it is small. Possibly helping an elderly person across a street or picking dropped things up for people. Community service should be a requirement to always help out whenever available to do so or when the student knows that they are capable of doing a larger task. In conclusion students should always be aware that they must help out the community but unless they are capable, in which they will be required to help, not have to do any difficult tasks and only small ones."
21581,0,"Dear Principal, I think that not allowing phones at all would be your best choice. When the students are at school, they are there with their friends so they don't actually need their phones with them to communicate. The students don't need to text their friends at lunch when they could just walk over to them and say hi. The students need to learn important social skills to get through life, and cell phones could cause them not to learn these skills. Second, even if phones were just allowed during free time, I'm sure you'd see their effects elsewhere, too. Having phones during school would encourage cheating because is gives the students silent ways exchange answers. Also, you might also find that the students are less focused on the material they are learning and more focused when they can next update their facebook status. Lastly, if students are in the middle of a conversation on their phones when lunch ends, it's very likely they won't stop the conversation just because they have to go to class. You might find that students are going to the bathroom to use their phones or texting their friend from under the desk. This leads to not paying attention in class and missing out on important information, which can affect their grade by a lot. As you can see, it would be best to keep your school phone-free for the good of the students and their social skills. The students can live without their phones for six hours a day, and they can actually talk to their friends instead of texting them. I strongly believe that you should not allow phone on your school grounds and I very much hope you agree with me. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME"
21781,0,"Dear Principal, I believe that the policy one is better because students bring their phones to school to communicate with their parents. Students also bring their phones to school to let their parents know if they need to be picked up from school or if they need to stay later with a teacher. Allowing students to bring their phones to school is also helping parents because they will know if they need to pick up their child or not and they will know what their child is doing. I believe if you allow students to bring their phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times they are less likely to be using them during class time. Allowing students to use their phones during lunch periods and other free times will give them some freedom and will result in them being happy. With policy two and not allowing them to have their phones at school at all is not a good policy because students will not be able to communicate with their parents to let them know if they need to be picked up or if they need to stay after school with a teacher. By allowing students to bring their phones to school there is a chance for them to disobey and use them during class time without the teacher being aware. As a punishment for using their phones during class time without permission, the students phone should be taken away for a period of time. After that period of time is up the parents should have to come and get the phone. I believe a punishment like this should have the students think twice about using their phone during class time. If students are allowed to use their phones during lunch periods and free time I don't think they would try to use their phones during class time because they already know when they can use it so they don't want to get it taken away before their free time. Thank you for your time and I hope you take this into consideration."

So that instead of students always doing things for themselves they should do something for someone else for a change. I will say this to all the students. Why stay in the house all day playing video games, doing nothing, just watching television? When you could be helping someone in need or help the environment get healthy One way you can help your community is by planting a tree, giving food to the homeless, volunteering at an animal shelter or a homeless shelter. You maybe want to change your life but help someone change theirs. How would you feel if you really needed help or wanted to make a change but no one will help you and no one will support you in any way what so ever, what do you think will happen to you if your homeless or don't have enough oxygen because you never tried to plant a tree not a day in your life?

They shouldn't use they phones because it causes accident and most of the time when u on the phone driving people can't multitask and they get distracted and pay more attention to the phone instead of the road and end up hitting a car from and the person that be on the phone they be the ones with no insurance. Reports has that 1.6 million car crashes are caused because drivers try to text and drive. If the police had a device to see if a person is on their phone while driving, they should loss their driver.

Asking for multiple opinions can help you see the different side of the situation. For example when you go to the doctor and they diagnose you with something you might ask for a second opinion from another doctor, which would help you get a better grasp on what the problem is and what you can do to solve it. when your asking your friends what kind of activity you should do together you should ask most of them for their opinions, you would be able to know what most of your friends like to do. Asking for multiple opinions is good because it helps you make better choices, you get to see different sides of the situation, and you would know what the people around you like to do or what their opinions are. Everyone likes making good choices, especially when youre choosing something important. Asking for peoples opinion on something important can help very much. When youre looking for a college you dont just ask you parents about one college you ask for multiple opinions on multiple colleges, therefor helping you narrow out your options. When your looking for a pet you should ask multiple worker their opinions on different dog so you know which one suits you best. Knowing peoples opinions on things is good for knowing what to do or what to choose. Seeing different sides of the situation is also important. when school drama breaks out and you dont know what happened you go around asking what there onions are on the drama. By doing this this you are obtaining more knowledge on what happened and what different people think about it. Courts call people to jury duty so the judge can tell if the defendant is guilty or not. Knowing different opinions on a subject can help you decide what your opinion is. Knowing what people round you like to do can benefit you. youll make more friends and discover new things about different people. For example: you and your family are going on a vacation but you cant decide where to go so you ask your family's opinion and pick a place that everyone likes. If you dont ask any one for their opinion and just do what you like some people will get mad. Asking for peoples opinions can help you make a choice everyone agrees with..

8730,0,He tells us that venus shows signs of once having life and watter because of all the hills and mountains and valeeys and craters. and since venus was the second earth like planet it makes sense since earth is home to all these life forms and all these metal and materials. and the examples are scattered through out the article and are actually very fascinating and cool because its weird to think other plnets couldve helped life forms other then earth itself. this article was pretty fun and im so glad i got to read it and learn from it. but the thing about this is i learned so much more about venus and what it is like on there with the sulfur acid and the hot temperatures and the prssure on it and how a human would die instantly but how scientist are finding ways to look at the planet without anything getting destroyed or damage. life is so amazing if you rell just stop to look at it and have time to realize how lucky we are to have all these things next to us in our own life and what we will have in the after life in heaven with God himself and how everything we do will pay off and we'll have endless peace and hope forever.

Well, what's it going to be? Keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular votes for the president of the United States? In the text In defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the presiden it states that, ""The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popualr votes the winner."" This means that The Electoral College is like a person or a thing that seems to belong to the past and it doesnt fit into the president. It aslo states that the advocates of the position are correct for agruing that the Electoral College is not a modern sense, it's the electors who elect the president, not the people. In the text The indefensible Electoral College: why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong states that "" It's official: The electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" This means that people now know the truth, they think that it is unfair and will not listen to your opinion or anything you have to say about the president or senators you elect."
3411,0,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break should these projects be teachers designed or students designed?. I'm taking pocition of this topic, In my opinion students should be have their own projects during the summer, the students already knows, whats the problem is or what they have it trouble with. students involved in summer projects, could be one way to students can learned also students can have more skills if they keep practice with their own projects and ideas they are going to be ready when they coming back to school, I'm totally agree with that the students should be designed their projects,For example, I'm a student of ESL, I like to make my on projects during summer to dot not forgot what I already learned during the year, in others words students need to work in their on projects during their break The firs reason about this topic, some students, who feel more comfortable making their on projects is that they will know how the topic goes, because they were the ones who created. in fact, If schools let students to make their own projects, they will be more comfortable because they will know what the topic is about and it will be easy for them to make it. Second reason, students needs to make their own projects during summer could be more help for the students, when they came back to schools, because they are not going to forgot it, what they already learned,the students don't have to stop working their own projects because if they stop probably they become lazy. for example ESL students, if they don't try to make their own projects they will be forgot everything. I think that the students, needs to have their own projects during summer, that would be a good for students, also, students, won't forget everything that already leard during the year, because they are still working on their own projects and understanding better their projects, I'm totally agree with that the students, can do better without teacher during summer, students can be more active and show more their abilities, if they try they will make it. there are many points to students make their own projects during summer."
19145,0,"I dont think that we should keep the electoral college. i think that we should just have it to where it would just be an election by popular vote for the president of the United States. One reason that i feel this way is because you dont always have the power of knowing why you are voting for. Another reason is because sometimes voters get confused about the electors and they vote for the wrong candidate. Did you know that in the year 2000 over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind that we have now. Another fact is that under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. Just think of it this way state legislatures are trechnically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. For example perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would then be thrown to the House of Respresentatives, where state delegations vote on the president and the senate would choose the vice president. so basically if there were to be a tie in the electoral vote you wouldn't even have a vote in who you're voting for. Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for congress, the House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe. At the basic level the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner take-all system in each state, the candidates dont spend time in states they know dont have achance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidnecy in the hands of a few swing voters in ohio, they have yet to make it."
17454,0,"Driverless cars sound like everybody's fantacy, you see and hear about them from everywhere; fictional movies, childrens books, television, but having a driverless car might not be the fantacy you hoped for. There are many problems that come with the driverless cars. While you may be able to get around easily, who would be at fault if technology fails and someone is injured- The driver, or the manufacturer? Surely If you were to be in an accident because the car itself malfunctions causing injuries to you and other people you wouldn't be to blame? Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert human drivers. In most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars. Why? Because it is rather dangerous. Another negative aspect would be that not everybody would agree with driverless cars, so would this cause a problem? Having normal cars and driverless cars on the streets together? Having a driverless car will cause issues with navigating through roadwork or accidents, because they might be programmed for certian roads with certain conditions. So if something were to happen such as an accident would the car know when to stop? Or if there was an ambulance coming down the road for an emergencey, would the car know to pull over and let it pass? Another con to the driverless cars would be that there would be so many sensors to go along with it. These types of cars need to have sensors in every direction, because there are unexpected animals, or children that cross the road without paying attention, they need to make sure the sensors are able to detect those types of things fast. Technology is going very far but not this far yet, we might be trying to rush it too much, having only driverless cars would pretty much mean getting rid of normal cars, therefore; Many car buisnesses go out of work and many people lose their jobs. That being said, it would be way to expensive to replace normal cars with driverless cars for the billions of people in the world. While there are many benefits to this idea of driverless cars there are just as many if not more cons."
11876,0,"Should emotions come in the way of teaching? Some may feel uncomfortable, and some may think its nessasary. With teenagers now a days emotions are very unpredictable. There is many things to take thought into before introducing this 'Facial Action Coding System' in schools. Teenagers go through many emotions during the day. In one hour they may feel tired, sad, mad, or even discusted. But then the next hour they may feel happy, excited, or surprised. The point is that students' emotions are very unpredictable. Yet I feel like these emotions should not get in the way of teaching. Another thing that is very important to point out is that this approach might make students feel uncomfortable or even exposed. Privacy can be very important for some students. School is supposed to be a place where students can come and learn not have to worry about their emotions. That shouldn't be an excuse. Not all students have the same emotions, to make a plan that goes with every students' emotions is close to impossible. However, teachers may find this approach helpful. They would know if the students are bored and they might be able to go about their lesson a different way. This would help to get the attention of the students and to keep them entertained. This approach would make it easier for teachers to connect with their students too. Overall, having this approach in school in my opinion, isn't nessasary. Of course it could be helpful to get students more engaged in their learning, but this approach could also make students feel uncomfortable. It'll be very difficult to come up with a lesson to work with every emotion in a classroom full of develpoing kids."
7718,0,"Do your kids only want to stay inside and play video games? I know that I would love to do that, but the principal thinks that us students should partake in a extracurricular activities. I don't like the idea of that, but he is right. Students should take part in extracurricular activities. If kids just stay inside and play video games or watch videos on YouTube or Disney+, we could grow up to be dependent on other people, we wouldn't be strong, and maybe become very violent. The first reason why kids should take part in extracurricular activities is because if they just play video games and watch videos on YouTube, Disney+, Netflix, or Hulu, they could get lazy and depend on somebody else to do things for him. This also ties in to the fact that I said that they wouldn't be fit or strong. If they spend their whole life not doing anything productive, they won't be very strong and if somebody asks that kid to lift something up, they may not be able to do it. Since I already talked about the second reason why kids should takes part in activities, lets take about the last reason. Some movies, videos, and video games are very violent like Call of Duty or GTA. Kids that play those type of games may think that all that stuff is normal and become violent. They may start to say bad things or destroy stuff. If we let them play many different activities, they they may develop teamwork skills and make friends. That is why I think that the principal is right and that we should let kids play extracurricular activities. It may help the future generation of kids. Don't you thinkl that it is a good idea?"

The amount of space and walkway in an area like that, would that be a pro or con for you? People all over have participated in local events where cars are banned for a day, like Paris and Colombia, and some want to get rid of it completly like Vauban, in Germany.

This is an advantage to people because they perfer a healthy, stress free life, according to the passege, ""As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here"". Smog is usually because of fossil fuel admission. This is why Paris proposed a partial ban to vehicles. Paris nearly had a near-record pollution. Paris was a little more operatable, according to the passege ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france, after five-days of intensifying smog...[The smog] rivaled Beijing,China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. Less congestion is a valid reason to limit vehicle use, being more spacious and operatable. People may complain about the penalties or the transportation is needed, but people can carpool, and transportation was free in that limited time frame. eventually the fog was less visable, and people could return to the normal lives. However the damage is continuing, Getting a smart car would be a splendid idea, trade the bad fossil fuel car, to provied clean transportation if needed.

You get to explore the world and its uneqe sites like Europe, China, Greece, Venice, and more! I had many advencures away from the ship as well as on the ship. Once I toured an excavated castle in Crete. I also saw the Panama Canal on the way to China and took a gondola ride in the watery city of Venice! You get keeped working hard cleaning and taking care of the animals but you also get a whole lot of fun! Two weeks may seem like a long time at sea but there are many things that make time fly by! When the animals are getting unloaded you can play games like baseball and vollyball in the empty holds where the animals are being housed. There is also many other games like fencing, reading, boxing, and table-tennis to make the time go faster. The opportunity has made me aware of the suffering and hardships in other countrys. Why can't it do the same for you? This opportunity is not all fun though. Once on one of my16 trips there where 335 horses and the hay and oats to feed them. All of the animals need to be watered 2 or 3 times a day so you can not get lazy! Stall have to be cleaned too! If you get a great opportunity like this, do not back down!

As long as they turn them of during class time or any other learning time. I think the students are old and responsible. To let them use there phones during lunch or any other free time. They should know when to use the phones. Students should be able to use there phones during there free time. It is there free time and they should know what there going to do with it. Either walk around talk or what ever they like to do or use there phones. They are old already and they what there doing. That's why the principal should let the students. Use there phones during there free time. The principal should also let the students use there phones during there lunch periods. There the ones that are having there lunch. There not learning there just having fun with there friends and eating. So there is no reason to not let students use there phones. During there lunch time they should know if there going to eat or not. So there is the other reason why you should let the students. Use there phones during there lunch period. So why not let the students use there phones. During there free time or lunch time. If there not learning there just having fun. They just will have to turn them of when they have to learn.

6511,0,"I agree with the principal decision about participating in extracurricular activity's. It will give the students something to do, instead of going home and doing nothing. The extracurricular activity could bring students together and create friendships. There are multiple actvity you can do such as sports, work on the year book, and serve on the student council. It will also get the student more involed with the school and make them feel more comfortable with other students. You don't need to participate in one curricular activity you could particpate in multiple activity's. It give you a chance to get better at something like sports if you have never played sports this gives you a chance to play and even get better at it. There are lots of oppurtunities that open up for you. You don't have to participate in the activity's every day. But if you do wanna come to the activity's you must particpate if not your free to go home. There will be times where you can talk with your fans and engage with others. working on your schools year book would be a nice way to connect with our students to."
25690,0,"Have you ever thought your choice wasn't the best? Not feeling like your did the right thing can cause a lot of anxiety. So, a way to release yourself from that endless regret is asking for other people's opinions. Asking other people for their opinion can help you make a better decision because others can point out certain things you missed and it causes you less anxiety. To begin, people think differently, so they can point out things you may have missed. They can prove a point that you didn't even know existed in the situation. For example, if I was stuck trying to figure out if I should get the gray or white sweatpants for when I go horseback riding. So, I ask a friend which color I should get, and they point out that the white sweatpants would probably get dirty and disgusting, so I should just get the gray ones instead. Right there is a prime example of something I didn't even think about and in the end they ended up helping me make the right decision. Lastly, it causes less anxiety for you to feel like you made absolute best decision. Feeling like you've made the wrong decision can cause a lot of stress and anxiety for a person. Almost enough to swallow you whole! That's why asking for another opinion is beneficial for you and your anxiety. Having a second opinion really does help! In conclusion, seeking other people's opinions help big time in the long run. Asking for others opinions release a lot of weight off your shoulders. Multiple opinions help someone make a better choice because it causes less anxiety and other people can point out somethings you didn't notice. So next time your in a slump make sure to ask for another opinion."
1395,0,"My fellow citizens, some advantages of limiting car usage is that its better for the earth and reduces the greenhouse effect. Also there wont be as much smog and there will be a lot less pollution in the air. Limiting the usage of cars can be a better for you. not using a car can really benifit us. People use cars everyday for everyday things. If people cut down on the usage of cars and took the bus or even rode a bike to work it really could help the earth. Less cars means less of the greenhouse effect. Less of the greenhouse effect means a better world. Billions of people driving cars can really pollute the earth. Paris had to ban driving because the smog was to great and needed to be cleared from the sky. The smog was so serious that if you didnt leave your car at home you would get a fine. almost 4,000 people were fined. Beijing, China is one of the most polluted city in the world becouse of smog. If you dont take a car you could walk, bike, or skate witch could be fun. If not then you could always take the bus and still help of the earth. If you didnt take a car to work then it could reduce traffic. Some people enjoy riding a bike instead of a car because it reduces stress and also reduces pollution to the earth. Limiting car use is not only good for you but also good for the earth its self. there could be less greenhouse effect and smog. Lets all help and limit the usage of cars."
24648,0,"ADVICE!! People talk to more than one person for advice because they could have better options. The more options a person has a better way they could do something. People from experience should have better advice then people that has not had the experience. The more advice you get the better off you are more advice becomes into better ideas. Advice also can give you more ideas and bigger and better ideas. The first reason I think that seeking to multiple people trying to find advice is that people with the experience of the task can help you. People from experience should have better advice then people that has not had the experience. The more experience someone has normally can give you good advice about the task. When I need help with something I personally like to go talk to older people because they are the most likely to know how to do it and make it easier for you. That is why I go to older people for advice 95% of the time. The final reason I think asking multiple people for advice is to give the person better options for the task and possible better ideas for another project or task. I have asked people for advice for fixing a flat tire and I have asked multiple people for advice. Nobody seemed to know how to fix a flat without just buying a new tire. Then I asked my Grand-Pa for some advice and he said I have a perfect substance for this. He came out of the shed with some of this green stuff and he told me to squirt this in youre tire. I went home and squirted in my tire and it fixed my flat. Now this green stuff helps me with a lot of flat tires. If I havent of asked a lot of people then I would of had to get a new tire for all of my ATV's, UTV's, when they got a flat this green stuff has saved me a lot of money. This is why I think you should ask more than one person for advice. People from experience should have better advice then people that has not had the experience. The more advice you get the better off you are more advice becomes into better ideas. I hope this essay inspired you to ask people for more advice."

In the article it claims of huge rock formation that ""resembles"" a face. The picture was taken by a space craft at a far away distance forming shadowing giving the ""illusion"" of a nose, eyes, and mouth. First, the reason why the ""face"" is a natural landform is because on Earth you can compare a face in many objects around you. Some natural landforms on Earth such as Middle Butte in the Snake river Plain of Idaho looks like it has a face also. You can make out a face in even day to day objects. Even a tree near your neighborhood could look like a ""face"". Secondly, the reason why the ""face"" is just a natural landform is because the huge rock formation causes shadows. The shadows of the huge formation of rock can create the illusion of a face. The shadows can make it look like it has a nose, eyes, and mouth like structure in cases such as this one. Lastly, the ""face"" on Mars is a natural landform because the photo was taken by a satelite. The pictures come in pixels meaning it could come out blury or unclear to clarify. The shadowing of the mound also gives the illusion in the picture of a ""face"". The ""face"" on Mars is only a natural landform that was mistaken as something else more than that because of the illusion of a face."
22050,0,"2/14/11 Dear TEACHER_NAME, I think policy one is better. Which is to allow students to bring cell phones to school and use them when they have free time. I agree with this policy for many reasons. I think its both fair to the students and the school staff. As for the other policy, policy two, I'm going to have to disagree with that policy. There is no point in making that policy anyways because, students are still going to bring cell phones to school even though there asked not to. So I would, and most of my fellow students will also agree with policy one. One reason why policy one is better is because students need cell phones. For emergency's and other use. And if you try to make cell phones banned from school it will anger both parents and students. Some students need it to stay in contact with their parents and others need it for music, texting etc. Policy one states that cell phones can be used during lunch and free time. It's very disrespectful to text or call someone in class while the teachers are trying to teach, but policy one says that cell phones can't be used during class time. And I'm sure that if students get to use their phone during school hours while they have free time is more than enough which will prevent them from using it during class. Over all, I think that's its best to enforce policy one. I would rather to use my cell phone during lunch or free time but not using it at all is very uncomfortable. And I'm sure students will respect that policy more than policy two. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME class 814"
20208,0,"Does the Electoral College work? The Electoral college is a process in which it happens. The Electoral collge is not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the president. The Electors are people who vote for President and Vice President, and how many votes each one has gotten. The priotity in the Electoral College is that it consist of having 538 electors. 270 electoral votes is required to elect for the new President. It has to have the same amount of entitled alloment of electors to the same amount in its Congressional. ''Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors''. But are state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilties are. We as Americans all get a new President every four years and its always held on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. When you are voting for your presidenrt you're voting for your candidate's electors. But most staes just have a ''winner-take-all'' system that awards all electors to the new winning president candidate. Most people may not like who are next president is gonna be but all just have to deal with it because we all cant go back and pick who we wont to be president. It all depends on how many votes a person gets. Some may get only one vote and others will get millions of vote it all depends on if they think your good enough to rule your your county. It is very hard for you to make a decsion that big. After the presidentail election, your governor prepares a ''Certificate of Ascertainment'' listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. Your state's Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidentail election. the Indefensible Electoral college:Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? That would be Abolishing the electoral college! AL Gore-thanks to the quiks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost the presidency. More than 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election. The electorak college still has its defenders. If you are under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. Sometimes stae conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, sometimes the presidental canadidates themsleves. The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. What if state send two slates of electors to congress? It has happened before in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily vice president Richard Nixon, was there but he made sure to do so ''without establishing a precedent.'' The house's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of people. In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only just wright there. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen staes didnt see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a single campaign ad. It's finally done The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. Its har dto say but mr. Dole was right all along."

I think you should join the program because you get to help nations recover their supplies and explore the world as you travel which I thought was really fun to do. One reason I think you should be a seagoing cowboy is to help the nations by giving them more things they need such as food, animals, and more. I think helping the nations by doing this in the war will contribute to them so they could win if I give them the things they need to win the war. Another reason I think people should join is to have fun. I say that because while you are at sea you could explore different places around the world. While being a seagoing cowboy, I visited places like Europe and China while i was working as a seagoing cowboy. I also went to Greece to see an Acropolis, and I even went to an excavated castle in Crete. When the animals are unloaded you could play many things such as Table-tennis, baseball, volleyball, and many more in the empty holds where the animals were. In conclusion, i think people should join the seagoing cowboys program because you get to help the nations regain their supplies, and you get to have fun by exploring around the world. You should join because the seagoing cowboys program is fun and helpful to many people."

Traffic laws will of course have to be made for the driverless cars as time goes by, but I think that once they are fully driverless there will be little to no driving laws as the cars will be advanced enough to not have to worry about them. Cars may not be fully driverless in our lifetime, but I believe that eventually it will happen. Traffic laws for vehicles will be added and removed as the advancement of driverless cars continue. I think that there will be motion sensors or a sync that will detect when a car is coming to a stop sign or a stop light and will make it stop on its own. All the basic driving laws of today will either be altered or removed more than likely. Cars that are still required to have an actual person control them will be used more as entertainment purposes than for actual transportation. It will be like sporting events such as NASCAR and Formula 1 racing I would say. They will not be used for actual transportation though. Cars will not be fully driverless in our lifetime, I believe. We will be very close to achieving it, however. I think that they will still be semi-driverless by then."
11790,0,"I feel like it would be a good idea to have one of these in schools because, it can one tell how a student is feeling on any certian day. Along with that it can possibly predict how a student or a teacher will react to something that happens in the school or what another person says. It can also help the students with their work if the computer can tell that a student is struggling with their assignement, it can give them easier question but still get the point across for the class. I also backed this from the article because it mentions that a classroom computer can recognize when a student is becoing confused or bored. Another reason I think it woud be a good idea to have these in classrooms is, there are some students that learn better on a computer and this will help them if they do not understand a subject. There is also other students that can not learn if most of there course is online and to difficult for them. So this system could possibly tell a teacher or another staff member that this student does not work well on a computer. These are my reasons to as why I feel like it would be a good idea to have the Facial Action Coding System in a school. I feel like it can benefit some students off the jump and, I also feel like it can help some students get to where they need to be if they are struggling."
10402,0,"Facial Action Coding System This passage explains how FACS could help for a lot of different things. For example in the article it says ""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa."" Meaning that if the FACS really does work, it could be used for knowing how teenagers feel about school and learning. Teenagers now an days think school is boring. Sometimes teachers don't even know when their students are paying attention. If schools had emotion-recognition software we would be able to know if our students are into the lessons. The FACS could help teachers understand how their students may feel. In paragraph 6 it says ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" In my opinion i think it is true, having a emotion-recognition software could really help teachers. Some kids are to nervous to ask the teacher to repeat the lesson, kids get confused easily, having a FACS could really help. It could let you know if your student is confused or bored. This could really change the way of teaching, some teachers don't even pay attention to their students. Having a emotion-recognition software could really help all around the world. The creator tested the new software on the Mona Lisa painting. The results were incredible. He says ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" It also says ""It could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor, the same technology can make computers animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery."" Having this software could really help people understand how others feel. This proves how technology could be very useful, this new generation is going to change the world, and so is this new FACS software. Dr. Huang created the FACS to underdstand human facial expressions. I say that in my own words having a emtion-recognition software could really help people. Sometimes teenagers hide their emotions and put on a fake smile or pretend to be happy when they are not. Teenagers now an days don't really like showing their emotions because in their mind they think it makes them seem weak. Sometimes teenagers don't want to talk about what is wrong, and sometimes teachers/parents don't even know what to do. That technology could really change the world. In paragragh 6 Dr. Huang notes ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, so computers need to understand that, too."" That is true. Now that kids have iphones and computers, they could use emoji's to express how they feel."
14081,0,"2/1/11 Dear Mr. Principal, I believe that students should not be required to do community service. It is their choice. If they want to, they should but you can not force them to do so. I also believe that you should only make students who have gotten in trouble or been bad to do community service as punishment if you want to. This will help the community and make them learn their lesson. For an illustration, if a girl or a guy gets into trouble instead of giving them detention, just make them help out the world by doing some community service. This explains that it will benefit you and your world. This also illustrates that this punishment is better because in detention, you do nothing and just keep quiet but with this, they actually do something which would make them very sore and make them never want to do it again. I believe that detention rate might go down because of this. Time is very valuable which is why community service should be a choice. People who do community services for free I believe should feel happy with themselves and shouldn't care what other people thinks. For a demonstration, if you have done something good and you friend told that it was a waist of time, you shouldn't care what they think. This explains that if you don't care, they might stop since people will stop if you show no reaction. This also explains that people can feel happy with what they do no matter what. This is why people shouldn't care about how people judges them. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME"
20870,0,"Dear Principal, The majority of students in middle and high schools are glued to their cell phones everywhere they go. Even though they are used to text friends frequently, they are also important to scheduling. I think the policy best suited for our school would be the first policy. Cell phones are often necessary to determine whether or not a student can get home after school, to schedule after school activities, and to make plans with other students. To take away all of their right to use a cell phone during school hours would limit them to not being able to do this while eating lunch or having a free period. If a student is unsure if their parents can pick them up from school or not when they aren't taking the bus, it is necessary to contact either their mom or dad to see if they can get home quickly after school ends. Sometimes, when a student isn't able to call a parent, they end up waiting for an hour or more outside the school until he/she is picked up from school. Students need to be able to use cell phones for situations like these, especially when they much homework to complete for school because then they have less time to do their required work. Another reason why students should be allowed to use their cell phones during lunch and free times is because many are involved with some sort of after school activity. Whether it's a sport, musical instrument, or anything else, events within that activity are often scheduled last minute or without the student knowing days ahead of time. When this happens, they may not have transportation to the location if it is not held at the same school. In this scenario, students should be able to contact a parent or friend who can drive them to wherever they need to be. The last reason why I think you should choose Policy 1 is because students need to take a break from working constantly and make plans with friends. Students have so much homework to do when they come home from school, and sometimes it can become overwhelming. Students need to be able to spend time with friends after school and not be always thinking of all the work that needs to get done by the next day. Taking a short break is helpful and make them feel less stressed about their schoolwork. So, students should also be able to use their cell phones to call or text friends to schedule activities together. They can even study for an upcoming test or quiz together, so they can get a higher grade. Overall, Policy 1 is a better policy because it still allows students to sometimes contact others with their cell phones. Today, cell phones are used by the majority of Americans multiple times. To take away their cell phones wouldn't be right. In some situations, students need them to call or text others to help them for whatever. Policy 1 works best because they have the chance to contact parents or friends when they need to, but they won't get distracted during class when they are turned off. This policy allows them to take care of anything they may need to, yet still be able to focus in class. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME"
24781,0,"When people face a problem or are in need, they generally seek outside opinions to help them tackle their issues. Receiving multiple of these opinions is very beneficial for many reasons and in many cases it can be crucial to finding the best answer. It can eliminate false statements and incorrect facts that one person may give you, it can eliminate bias from one side, and it can be important in finding the best answer for the problem, as having more minds being put into a problem gives a higher chance that the best answer will come out. By getting more than one opinion on a problem, the person asking can be assured that they are avoiding bad or false statements and facts. One person may be incorrect or may have low amounts of knowledge on the topic at hand. This can lead to big problems later on down the road for the person seeking the advice. However, getting more opinions on the topic can help in finding the correct facts, and quickly pushes out the few peoples ideas who have a bad understanding of the topic. For example, when I was younger I accidentally broke a necklace that my mother loved a lot. I was extremely worried that if I told her I would get in huge trouble, and I had no clue what to do. At first, I asked my older sister what to do, thinking she might have had a past experience with such an issue. She recommended to me that I should just hide the necklace, and pretend to not know where it was when asked by my mom. This seemed wrong to me, but I wasn't sure, so I sought other opinions. First, I asked some of my friends, and they instead recommended that I just tell the truth and tell her about how I accidentally broke her necklace. I wasn't sold yet on this opinion either, so I decided to ask one more person, my older brother. I then explained to him the situation, and he instantly reassured me on what my friends had said. He told me to tell her what had happened, and that she wouldn't be too mad as he knew that she could fix the necklace and would appreciate my honesty. In the end, it turned out my brother and my friends were correct. By doing what they said I avoided as much trouble as possible, and my mom got to have her necklace. By seeking multiple opinions I ended up with the safest and best answer possible. Seeking multiple opinions not only avoids bad or false statements, but it also avoids bias. Bias has become an increasingly strong issue in our country and in our people. Bias can be very detrimental to people who are seeking outside opinions on an issue, and may steer them down the wrong path. Someone with extreme bias on a topic may have clouded judgment on what the true facts and details on an issue are, making their opinion untrustworthy. Seeking multiple opinions, especially opinions from both sides of an issue are key in avoiding bias, as seeing both sides of the equation makes it easier to find a middle ground. For example, when people search to find the best presidential candidate, they will find extremely biased answers from both sides of the media. In order to find the best answer to the question of voting, voters must look at both sides, democratic and republican, to find the best answer for who should be the nominee. By simply viewing republican or democratic media, the voter will experience extreme bias and a sub par answer to the question of who really is best fit for the job. This is why getting multiple opinions and statements from both sides allows the voter to find the best answer for who will be the strongest candidate for the presidency. This shows how getting multiple opinions eliminates bias from a topic, but attaining more opinions and putting more heads together to solve an issue can also be critical in getting the best answer, and not just the correct one. Finding not only the correct but also the best solution to a problem is key in some situations. In order to do this, the person seeking the best answer must get outside opinions on the topic. Putting more heads together to think about ways to solve a problem has been proven to produce the strongest answers possible. This proof can be shown in a 2016 study done by Dr. Williams of Harold-Webster University. Some things listed in the study showed that groups found better and more sustainable answers to problems that they were given than people who were working with only one other person on the same topic. The numbers were staggering, as the groups of people had a 95.7% success rate in finding the best possible solution, while the people working with only one other person only had a 60% success rate in finding the best solution to the same issue. The study concluded that groups of people were way more efficient and successful than the other people who worked on the same topic with a partner. The study went as far as to recommend the practice of getting others opinions and working in groups to it's readers. This clear benefit in getting advise from multiple people to solve problems has inspired top scientists to collaborate with others on their work. Even the president must find outside opinions, such as when he consults his advisers or when he calls a special session of congress to talk things over. This clear benefit of multiple opinions is what the very principle of democracy was founded on, and makes up our United States politics and ideals today. Getting the best answer on a topic is just one of many good reasons to get multiple opinions to help solve a problem. Overall, seeking multiple opinions is a great way to find the best and most efficient answers to a problem. This method of problem solving is great as it avoids bias and can easily rule out bad opinions that use false facts. While asking only one other person for advise can be good, it can also be flawed and can be risky, and it never hurts to just ask a few more people. Collaboration allows for multiple minds to work together, and it allows humans to do what they are best at, being social creatures."
12999,0,"If you want to believe that the face on Mars was created by aliens, that is fine, but we have evidence that it was not. The reason behind this is that like a lot of parts of Earth, it all naturally happened. Even if we find a clearer picture we have comfirmed in 2001 that it was just another natural landform And in the more clear picture, this face is the same as buttes or mesas commonly fond in the American West. As we have been looking for more evidence we have gotten clear picture one after one, just to show that there was nothing left behind from aliens at the time. That was just the beginning. If we really have found a ancient artifact, then we would have started collecting small bits and pieces to examin them. Now, lets say that we did find that aliens created these lanndforms. We probably would have let more pictures to be seen to show proof of what we found. Yes, there was also a thing during our winter where that everything on Mars is also hazy so that could be why we have been left to conclusion that it just naturally happened. However, if the monument gets abandoned every once in awhile then there could tools and items left back at it. If a landform was man made or in this case alien made, then there would be mistakes made, changes every once time. As in an article that was read not that long ago, Jim Garvin says that the face on Mars looks about the same height as a Middle Butte in Snake River Idaho. This means that it was no matter what others say, it is just a natural landform that has just happened to look like a face. As from what Garvin said, ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" For that being so, the face is not an alien monument. The landform just has happened to be there and look like some face. Which if you still want to believe in the fact it could an alien thing that is fine. We have no alien evidence at all."
3803,0,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. These summer projects should be student designed. Having students create their own summer project would be a new experience. It would be good opportunity for them to showcase their knowledge. it would demonstrate: cognitive thinking skills, creativity, and the knowledge acquired throughout the school year. Having students design their own summer project would require cognitive thinking skills. Cognitive thinking skills are essential to designing a summer project because students must put their heads together to create a project they all agree on and enjoy. Students also have to think of what to incorporate into the project. It's important for students to cooperate and pitch in ideas for the project. Creating an assignment requires thinking like a teacher. Designing a project is difficult but can be accomplished if students set their minds to it and focus on the task at hand. All these things require a higher level of thinking. Creating a summer project would spark student creativity. Most of the time during school, students do not use their creativity but the chance to create their own project would encourage them to be creative. Since the students are the ones creating the project, they most likely want a project that is fun and enticing. Coming up with ways to make school work fun can be difficult but it's possible. In order to design a fun summer project, one must be creative and think outside the box to create a project everyone enjoys. Allowing students to design their own summer project would their knowledge of everything learned throughout the school year. It would put their knowledge to the test to see how much information was actually retained. It would also give students an idea of how what was learned in class will be used in their daily lives. In conclusion letting students design their own projects would be a wonderful opportunity for them. It would make them use cognitive thinking, creativity, and showcase their knowledge. It will be a new experience that would teach them valuable lessons. It will also teach them skills needed in everyday life."
8633,0,"""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is an article focused on the topic of studying Venus and what diffculties can happen, but also the benefits and knowledge gained. The author describes how exploring Venus can be dangerous but can also help the Earth's population. The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents very well with evidence. The author supports the main idea well with evidence and details included in the article. At first, the author shows some of the dangers involved in exploring Venus, ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals"". This fact gives an example of a bad situation that people might go through if they explore Venus. The author uses this fact to remain unbiased and show both sides of the argument. Later in the article, the author says, ""Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way... Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans"". This statement describes a solution to humans not being able to survive Venus's conditions. Exploring Venus is so important that scientests thought of ways to complete that mission safely. Lastly, the author states, ""Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth... Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel"". This realization illustrates how beneficial traveling to Venus is because it could be a planet that humans could use for habitation. Exploring Venus is necessary because the human population might need to use the planet in the future. It is always good to have a backup plan if something on Earth goes horribly wrong. Overall, facts listed in the text support the author's main idea and purpose. The main idea, that Venus is worthy to pursuit even with its dangerous elements, is supported and shown well by the author. The author does this by including facts and statements that keep the article unbiased and describe the incredible benefits of exploring Venus. The main point comes across well because it opens the readers' mind to the possibility of venturing to Venus and what it could do for our planet."
25225,0,"What are the benefits of asking more than one person for advice when making a decision? For example, a boy is challenged with the option of running for the highest leadership in his community. What shall he do to make sure that he is making the right choice? To put it simply, your average boy next door has the opportunity to be a youth leader in his community. With natural leadership skills, his parents have no doubt that we would make a good leader, but doubt still seems to be a deciding factor. Our boy is faced with doubt and overwhelming uncertainty of his options. With so much going on, he has no idea of what he should, and can do. Would you, as his neighbor help him? When people have a decision to make, consulting more than one person can oftentimes lead to the better choice. Sometimes, others can have more knowledge than you, and therefore would be a better source. Others, especially adults with more experience can even tell you possible outcomes of your decision. Seeking advice from people with experience, knowledge, and wisdom can help you make the right decision. More than one set of eyes on a topic can be a good thing sometimes. With more people reviewing your choices they could catch mistakes, or even tell you what you could do to improve your idea or choice. For example, when I wanted to buy a new camera, I was torn between so many different options. After asking my parents, friends, and family, I finally made the best choice for my money. Even when you have a small decision to make, like what to buy for lunch, asking your friends could help you get the best option they have to offer. Even when the President is making decisions, he too has people he can ask for advice. No matter what choice or decision you have to make, asking others for advice is a healthy option. When others have more knowledge than you, their opinions and advice can be more in depth, practiced, or even more intelligent. To put it into perspective, if you have a question on math homework, asking the teacher would be more beneficial that asking your peer, or table mate. If you want to switch classes, or change your schedule, asking a counselor, or teacher with more knowledge than you can help you make the right decision too. Even when a high school student is applying to college, they too would ask their parents for advice. Using other's experienced advice, older knowledge and wisdom can lead you down the road to the right choice. When making a big decision, sometimes asking somebody who has done such a thing before can tell you the outcome, or give you experienced advice. If a girl wants to get contacts, she could ask her parents, family members, or teachers who have had contacts before for advice. They themselves have had it before, so they would know the outcome, and therefore would be a great resource for advice. I know that when I wanted to go to summer camp, I asked my teacher who had been there before. She knew what it was like, and could tell me all about it so I knew I was making the right decision. Even when an aspiring actor or singer wants to join the industry, they too ask those who have gone through the same process for advice, or what to expect as an outcome. Asking those with experience, or previous knowledge can not only help you make the right choice, but also tell you about an outcome that the choice might provide. Seeking advice from people with experience, knowledge, and wisdom can most definitely help you make the right decision. So, would you help the boy next door? If you have been through what he is experiencing, would you offer him advice? It can be tough to find people, but more than one person reviewing a topic or choice can help someone make the right decision. Having other people review your decision, or asking multiple sources can sometimes help you make the right choice. Even asking more experienced individuals can help too. When asking someone who has more in-depth knowledge, or is wiser, you can receive advice that you wouldn't have thought of. Even when making a big decision, like our boy next door, you can ask people who have done such things before. When asking those who have experienced first hand the choices you want to make, you can get opinions or advice from more experienced individuals. When you ask others for help, advice, or opinions, you have the chance to dive into a world of possibilities. When asking more than one person, you can experience even more possibilities. Asking other can give you the best help you may ever receive."

The Seagoing cowboy is when you or someone else that helps take care of the animals on a boat, while they are crossing oceans. That is kind of like joining the milatary or the army. You are basically risking your life for other people, some peope you probably don't even know. It can be a lifetime experience. It also can be a huge opprtunity. Like Luke couldn't say no to for trying something new after he was done with school. He was also at a young age. Starting early. After you are done with trying something new, you will realise that you have done something wonderful. While you are working, you also realise that you are having fun while doing it. You could be working hard and having fun at the same time. Some people think,if you do something that can take your life, isn't fun. I'm just saying if you like to do something then work hard to acomplish it. And I'm not just saying that you have to do that,but once you do it, you could have fun by doing it. Just like Luke did. Before finishing school, you should make plans for what you want to do. Dont wait to the last minute to think. Making differences is a good thing, not a bad thing. It seemed like Luke didn't know what Seagoing was, but it was something new so he went on and did it. Seagoing can also give you a opprtunity to have fun with animals, if you like them. Luke grew up in farms, so I guess he liked them. He was prepared to work that job. I wouldn't want to do that, because I'm not a big fan about animals.

I think is not benefit for student, that take classes online because in the video maybeabilities,and dont have a teacher is not organized dont have partner when are you take the classes online. Teacher: when are you take the video online you dont have a teacher for tell you what do you need do in the class,and him cant help in your work for example the teacher cant help with kahoot or quizlet or with others strategies of work. Organized: when you take the class online you dont have organized, if you need highlights or pensil for write something for read it or explain your work. Partners: in the class you dont have partners or others people with you, just are with your teacher online, but is not your confidence or your friend like in the school the many people is your frends However; the people can say you cant take the class online because you work for ten hours for this you need to take the class online, but is not bad idea take the class, but you cant work or cant study after school with partner. Conclusion: you dont are prepared for take the class online worst is a video coferencing because you dont have teacher, organized,and partners in the end you cant take the class because is more difficult for learn in your work. is more better take the class in the school you have more benefit how you can pass the class and more oportunities that the school have for you,and in the school you can help new students,and in the school you can protrude like better student in the school.

Then when you turn on the tv use the Facial action coding system. People sometimes dont know what mood there in at school, some people love coming to school, some hate it, but some people dont like to be bothered. Alot of people like to stay to themselves at school, so maybe using the FACS would make thhat student angry, when probably that person was in a happy mood so it works both ways if you ask me but i really do think the FACS would be good for class rooms."

The ""face"" on Mars could be many things but scientist have evidence that it is a natural landform. In the story it says that the natural artifact is like some landforms in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. It also says that few scientist believe the Face was an alien artifact so if it's not that and that have other evidence it has to be a natual artifact. The Face is very similar to natural artifacts here on Earth. In the story it talks about a place in idaho that is very similar to the Face. It also says it looks very much like a lava dome. Scientist say a place in Idaho that is called Middle Butte looks very similar to the Face. The pictures the very nice camera took of the Face is proof that they do look alike and that it is just a natural artifact. Not very many scientist believe that the Face is an alien artifact and they back that up with the fact that it doesn't have the features of it. It might look very much like a humans face but they do not believe that. There scientist and they have evidence that it is not human like its just a natural artifact. Some people might believe that it is a human face and that the face does look like it but no it is a natural artifact. It is a natural artifact because scientist believe that and they have facts to back up there reasoning, for example in the story it talks about how the ""Face on Mars"" was a huge hit to scare people and things like that and then scientist come out and say they have conspiracy theories that the face is not evidence that there is life on Mars. All in all, scientist have many theories and evidence that the Face is a natural artifact. The Face might actually look like a person but there isn't facts yet that show there is life on Mars."
19208,0,"Dear State Senator, ""The Electoral college is a process not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" I do not thing think this is the best method of voting on the next President for our Country. I feel this way because the people of America do not really make the decision of who becomes President their vote just goes to a slate of electors. People may say that the Electoral College is fair but some of the biggest states only vote on democratic or republican canidates and thats not fair at all. The first reason I think the Electoral college should be abolished is because the deciding factor of who becomes Americas President doesn't come from the people it comes from the Electoral college. Under the Electoral college system, voters vote not for the President but for a slate of electors. The election process should be changed to ""election by popular vote."" Another reason I think we shouldn't use the electoral college is because some states are biased towards certain political groups so say California wanted a democrat to be President that person would recieve 55 electoral votes from just one state! Many states that don't have as many electoral votes may not even get to see the canidates because they only care about the larger states. For instance, during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. The third reason I think we should let the outcome be decided by the American people and not electoral colleges is because the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California. In conclusion, I think that the Electoral College should be abloished because the deciding factor for who becomes President comes from the electoral college, states can be biased towards certain political groups, and because its just simply unfair, outdated, and irrational just like Bob Dole said!"
23582,0,"As society becomes more reliant on technological advances, many individuals are now granted the opportunity to take online classes at home. Essentially, school systems have modernized their methods of providing various approaches towards an efficient education. Although virtual learning provides a more personalized learning experience for students, the consequences of implementing online classes outweigh the benefits. Online classes can hinder the development of social skills within individuals. The classroom setting and environment offers students a wide variety of ways to exercise their social skills and develop character by interacting with different individuals. For an example, many individuals who are confined inside their homes are unable to participate in healthy activities that involve engaging with other students such as sports, clubs, organizations, and other extracurricular activities. Oftentimes, the individual who finds themselves being accustomed to this way of learning have identified themselves as ""anti-social"" or socially awkward. This is due to the fact that they prefer to isolate themselves from group settings or from social events because they are apprehensive and, sometimes even, hostile towards others who attempt to change their habits. Some may argue that online classes have the ability to engage its students with insightful discussions with their teacher and peers online. However, physical presence plays a vital role in developing relationships and allowing students to overcome their social anxiety. Like any technological application, individuals typically use online platforms and sites to display a persona and in this case, online classes encourages these students to strengthen their online presence, but not their physical one. In terms of longevity, this method does not strengthen crucial life and work skills that they are expected to have when they join the workforce; it is simply unrealistic. These students are encouraged to hide behind a screen because they lack social skills, and they justify this practice because the education system glamorizes the idea of their innovative society. Overall, online classes not only affect their learning experience, but their social skills. Furthermore, online classes are not preparing individuals to face the reality of the workforce and the legitimacy of this method is ambiguous. The whole purpose of providing the youth with education is to be able to train them to become independent enough to be self-sufficient in the real world. In a school or classroom environment, they learn valuable teamwork skills that allow them to cooperate and collaborate with other individuals about how to approach an issue, overcome challenges, and propose a solution. This eventually leads to the building of bonds and relationships that could impact an individual's life or mental health, whereas online schooling encourages the opposite effect of this. By physically going to school, these individuals nurture their abilities to be problem-solvers and natural thinkers. Additionally, some students may not take online classes seriously as opposed to physically showing up for class. For an example, online students may not require a time constraint and does not require the students to be properly dressed for the ""class."" Sometimes, the individual may present themselves to an online class in their pajamas because they woke up an hour ago. This does not exemplify sophistication nor does the class seem respected. On the other hand, if the student were to show up to school, they would look much more prepared and willing to learn. This highlights the difference between individuals who value their education and the ones who do not. Lastly, online schooling does not account for individuals with learning disabilities. Most schools consist of people from various races, ethnicities, backgrounds, sexes, and learning capabilities. Not every student thinks the same way, so they should be encouraged to express their creativity to establish a diverse school setting. Additionally, some students may possess specific learning disabilities such as ADHD, dyslexia, autism, mental illnesses, and more. In this case, these students require much more attention from their teachers to help guide them through this process, but an online class can only do so much. The teachers may be going at a faster pace than what these students can normally handle or they are confused about a certain area of the subject, so their frustrations may build up and lead to detrimental effects on their mental health. Although it is considered to be personalized learning, these individuals require careful guidance towards achieving the same success that their counterparts are experiencing. In the sense of virtual learning, these individuals are at a disadvantage because their learning disabilities are beyond their control. Video conferencing may be an option, but students with learning disabilities prefer not to share with their peers that they are struggling in a certain area or having difficulties understanding the curriculum, but would much rather keep this information confidential between themselves and their teachers. By implementing online classes, schools should reassess the validity of its efficiency and the impact it will have on students. Virtual learning can have benefits, but is effective to a certain extent. Ultimately, the negative imbalance between the consequences and benefits of virtual learning suggests that online classes should not be encouraged within school systems and to continue to maintain a traditional form of education."
21148,0,"Dear Principal, The two policies that you have considered are to help the students at this school focus during the duration of the school day. One policy may work better for certain things, and another may work well also. In my opinion, the policy that would be most beneficial to the school system and students would be the first one, ""Allow students to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time."". Having cell phones during class periods can be a huge distraction to kids, and can harm their grades as well as their future. They would not be allowed to have cell phones at all during school, and at times when they are not studying or learning, they may actually have to use their cell phones. For example, if a sudden storm of snow or rain cancels an after-school activity, and the student does not have any way of transportation to get home, then the student would have to go through a lot of trouble just to find someone who has a phone or a way of getting home. The first policy allows students to have cell phones out during times when they are not studying or learning, and would be very useful for the kids. In the situation described earlier, the student would just be able to take out their cell phone and turn it on, then call their parent or guardian to take them home. The situation would become much easier. The student's learning habits would not be harmed either, as long as they follow the rules and do not turn their cell phone on during class. If they do happen to have their cell phone on during class, then certain punishments may be necessary for the kids to not do this again. One punishment may be to temporarily take away the cell phone or reduce their grade in that class. There are even more situations that this policy could be useful in as well. If a student has an emergency with no way of getting to a phone, then the student could just take out their mobile phone and call whoever they have to. In this situation, the mobile phone could be a huge help or even a life-saver. I hope that you will consider the ideas I have presented during this document, and may take them into action, so that one day the school system will have a fair way of controlling the kids' cell phone habits during school hours."
14933,0,"Dear, Principal I think you should make it mandatory for your students to perform community service. It would benefit the community with your students helping out and may change several students. Most students don't do anything important after school or on there free time so it would give them something to do and it would be helpful to everyone. Just think about it which one do you think would be better for a student to do, tutor children or sit and watch television all day. Community service would only take a few hours giving them enough time to complete their home work and giving them time to do whatever hobby they enjoy. It would be better for them to help the community because it would make the community a better place. With people helping out especially with students, most likely they will learn something from their experience helping out the community. Since their are a lot of students their would be a lot of people helping out. It would help out and give the students something to do, consider adding community service to your school."
4243,0,"In high school, summer projects (especially for advanced placement classes) are assignments that students must complete. There is no way to get out from completing those assignments. Teachers create most of these summer projects because they know exactly what the students should learn before they reach the first class of the year. For example, AP Language and Composition has the students create 15 precis on different nonfiction pieces and read the book Thank You for Arguing in order to prepare for some of the essays that will be written for the exam. Although many people believe that teachers should create these summer projects because the students would know exactly what they need to learn or prepare for, nevertheless, students should be the ones creating the summer projects because it gives them a chance to show their creativity, use their skills from prior knowledge, and build on life skills needed for the future. Giving the students the ability to use their creativity is very important because it lets their voices and thoughts be heard. Students usually have more time over the summer to be able to express their creativity, but that is being pulled back due to the same projects that teachers have them do every year. For example, most high school math classes provide students with a four to six page study guide to complete over the summer to make sure that their prior knowledge is still remembered. What if students created their own, unique study guides to complete? How about a presentation on the basics of a unit and sharing it with the class the first or second day back? Not only would the students be able to use their creativity in a project and express their knowledge in many different ways, students in the first class would have a great review of prior knowledge to prepare them for the challenge ahead. Giving students an assignment that they create also makes them more interested and determined to complete their project. Most students would rather show what they learned their own way than the same way as everyone else, and a lot of teacher-designed assignments have the students all doing the same thing. It might be easier for the teacher to grade or review, but students aren't enjoying the assignment because they aren't able to express their knowledge that is different from everyone else. Letting the students create their own projects will give them the opportunity to be creative and express their ideas. Additionally, students will continue to use or remember the skills and knowledge prior to help them create their projects. The biggest reason why these summer projects are created is so that students wouldn't lose the skills and knowledge from previous years that are need for their upcoming classes. If the students created their own summer projects, they would not lose those skills or knowledge at all. More than likely, they would research more about certain skills or information in order to make their projects even better and stand out from their peers. Subjects such as science and english are definitely able to make this happen because the skills and techniques that are learned can always be worked on, and they are easier for students to share what they know about certain topics. For example, AP chemistry has everyone doing the same assignment before the school year starts. Students in AP Chemistry, instead, could create their own experiments with the skills and knowledge acquired from Research Chemistry. The students would not only keep the techniques/skills practiced and knowledge from the year before, but also have the opportunity to explore different skills or use the skills obtained at a more advanced level. Even though students wouldn't lose the skills and knowledge learned from previous classes, they would also learn and build on some others skills such as life skills. Student-designed projects would build on skills that students need for the future. Teachers help them practice life skills with these projects as they could be long and tedious. However, students should have opportunities to build these skills themselves to prepare them for the upcoming school year and their future in general. Students who would work really hard on their own summer projects build their organizational skills as they plan out their assignments. Time management is another skill that is taken into these projects. Practicing time management prepares them for college and their future careers as deadlines can't be rearranged, and some tasks take more time than others. They would be able to schedule how much time in a day they can work on their summer assignments. Students who create their own projects also practice focusing and perseverance. There will be times where the project comes to a stand still in progress; practicing focus and perseverance encourages students to not give up on their projects and to make it the best it can be. In conclusion, students will prepare themselves for future tasks such as college projects and career projects when they create their own summer projects in high school. So, what is the point on arguing about whether students or teachers should create the summer projects? These projects set up the students for what is coming in the following school year. The knowledge and skills used in previous classes are still needed for the upcoming classes. However, when students are able to be creative and make their own projects, those skills and knowledge would never leave them. In fact, teachers would be amazed at how advanced the skills of their students are because the students were actually interested in learning more to create an amazing summer project."

When the founding father created the consitution. I'm sure that they expected the system to last, and for the citizens to have a say in what happens to our home. but now is our government is denying us our, chance to make a difference in america. Voting. Many people think that the Electoral college is a place, But it actully is a process. the fonding fathers established it in the constioin as a comprmise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. But now it is a way for people with a big pocket, to get there say, in who get to be president. In source 2: the readers are told that over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election. What this tells the readers is, americans don't feel like their vote actually counts towards the election anymore. Now people are starting to wonder, Whats wrong with the Electoral college? The answer to that questions is, under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. To any american looking at this process happening and knowing their vote doesnt really matter. would feel like an injustise has been done to them, and they are absolutlly right. In the constition it say, That americanshave the freedom to vote, both men and women. so as a citizen of american, WE should be able to choose our president not an elector, from the electoral college. As an american the citizens should be able choose who they want for president. It is not only unfair and unjust, that our votes don't have any pull. But it is also going against what our fonding fathers worked so hard to perfect. A naton where the people's words matter. The people who work hard everyday, teaching our children, and protecting our citizens, the people who lay down their lives for this country. The people who support this country, no matter how many injustices are thrown at them. Those people should have the most sway in choosing our president. Not the people who have had to never work a day in there life, or the people who are not grateful for this country. when a person who holds a position in an american government office, is easily paid off, It s time for some new, loyal, and dedicated workers. who work just as hard as the rest of america."
7251,0,"You have just scored the game winning goal for your soccer team. ""Goal"", the crowd roars. Your team crowds around you with joy. This is a famillar feeling for students who take part in extracurricular activities. Whether its the newspaper club, robotics club, or the football team. These students get to feel a sense of acomplishment when he or she takes part in extracurricular activities. Therefore all students should be required to take part in an extracurricular activity. Joining these activities will help students make friends, explore future carrer options, and learn life lessons. Students will be able to make new friends if they are required to take extracurricular activities. For example they will be able to find students with simillar hobbies as them. To add on students will learn communication skills which they can use to make firends. For instance if a student were to join soccer they would have to talk to eachother to know who to pass the ball to and when. Lastly they will meet more of their new peers who are also apart of the same club or sport who they might have not ever met before. In conclusion extracurricular activities help students make friends. Extracurriculars also help students explore future carrer options. First of all students can figure out what they are good at and explore future jobs that match those skills. For example if a student was in the yearbook club and he or she was really good at drawing they could look into future carrers as an artist or graphic designer. Also speakers come in every two months and speak about their jobs and how students could pursue their dream jobs. Furthermore students have a chance to get a scholarship to college for doing a sport. Then they could continue that sport in college. Also being good at a sport will make it easier for them to get into their dream college. Which is why extracurriculars help students explore future carrer choices. Lastly by requiring students to take extracuriculars students learn important life lessons. For example student learn how to be good leaders. This is because in extracuriculars there is always a captain selected if you are selected as captain you learn how to be a good leader but, if u aren't selected as the leader you learn how to be a team player and how to follow a leader. To add on you learn how to balance your time. Therefore you must be able to keep up with all the stuff you have to do in your club and your school work at the same time. Lastly another life lesson you learn in clubs is how to communicate properley and respectfully with your fellow peers. These are a few of the may life lessons you learn while taking part in an extracurricular activity. All students should be required to take at least one extracurricular activity. Extracurriculars encourage and help students make friend, explore future carrer options, and learn life lesseon. As a student body we must stress to all students how important it is to follow the principals wishes and, join extracurricular activities."

Have similar features like earth. Venus could be the nearest option to visit. Astronomers are facinated by Venus beacause the believe ""it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"" meaning a similar discussion about Mars. They believe that Venus, long ago, ""was covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life"" demostration it could be an interesting visit to Venus and if the statements or beliefs are true, Sciencetist might find an answer why Venus doesn't support life or the bodies of oceans dissapear if it did have those features in the first place. ""Venus still has some features that analogous to those on Earth"" meaning there could've been a possibility about life on Venus but also was discover that ""the planet has a surface of rocky sidiment and inclused familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters"" demostrating interesting theories people can make why those familiar features are in Venus and how they were created if no life existed there. Finally, Venus ""can be our nearest option for a planetary visit,"" for example: and ""end of the world"" scenario. People could travel to Venus to start a new life there, if researchers make an innovation to make it safe to land in Venus and probaly restore life in the planet if it did long ago. The conclusion is, the reasons above explains why studying Venus is worthy despite the dangers. The visit can inspired a lot of researchers to make trips on othe planets that they may think it was Earth-like at some point or supported life in it. The planet Venus may have a thick atmosphere meaning a human won't be able to survive; however, the innovations that can be created for those problems can solve it. The features the planet has might help us and make us understand why now Venus doesn't support life anymore and how humanity can avoid the same problem."
13564,0,"Dear TEACHER_NAME, I think that students should be involved in community service because then it gives other schools good examples on how great our school is. And it also sets a good example. If we do community service then we are helping our environment and grow big as a society. We will be helping the earth and stop pollution. If all students perform it then the more help there will be to help out. My idea is to have groups of people every week to stay after school and do community service. Students can pick out the people they would like to work with and turn a sheet in for what team they are on and what grade and then the teachers will set out who goes with who, depending on the number of how big the group is then it will all be sorted out. That's one way of doing it and then the other thing that might interrupt that is if they are in after school activities then those kids wont have to do it but when their activity is over with for the year then they will have to be in the week they are called in to doing community service. And every Friday instead of having advisory we can try and clean up the community, like, picking up bottles, paper, cans, and any kind of garbage that might be on the ground. Like I said before this can make a big difference in the world and make not just students but every one to actually care about how our environment looks and feels like. Just like my mom always tells me ""If you want you're room to be clean all you need to do is clean it up."" I always think about that saying that my mom tells me when i think about cleaning the environment. But i really do think that you should follow this idea it might take along time but its all worth it if you're helping something be strong again."
2451,0,"There are many advantages today of limiting car usage. This accounts for car usage limits in Europe, United States, and many other places. Limiting car usage around the world isn't just good for society, but also for yourself. Limiting car usage helps to separate suburban life from over usage of autos. It's good for people to separate themselves from cars also because many people get stressed about their gas money, whether or not they will be late for something, and also because many people worry about their own driving, and may think they will injur somebody. Reasons why limiting car usage has been discussed throughout many people and regions. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. There has been efforts in the past two decades to make cities more suitable for walking but it's basic percepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation. From the passage, David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, says, ""All of our development since Wold War Two has been centered on the car, and that will have to change."" Mr. Goldberg describes how everything pertaining to where places are built, how many roads built, and not enough sidewalks is because of the car being the center of everything, that people are not focusing on anything else. Advantages of limiting car usage varies on different places. Some of these advantages include the ban of driving in Paris to help clear the air of the global city. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France after five days of intensifying smug. In Bogota, Columbia the streets of this capital city, eerily devoid of traffic jams. Banning cars also cause less accidents around the world. Not using a car for one whole day limits stress on people and greatly lowers air pollution. Limiting the usage of cars in Bogota has also helped the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city. Limiting car usage in many places even for one day has put a good effect on society, people, and the world. Limiting car usage in Germany suburbs opens the streets for tourists on trolly's or just people who need to be to work on a certain time who cannot afford cars. It also reduces the air pollution by very much. From the passage Heidrun Walter said, ""When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Opening the streets from cars allows isolation between suburban life and auto use. Greenhouse gas emissions will decrease by decline of car use which is good for the planet. Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals due to their high usage of diesal gas. Causing the decline of car usage will remove smog due to not as much diesal going into the air. In Bogota the Day Without Cars is held to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. The turnout was large, despite the gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota, Antanas Mockus, said, ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating."" He also stated, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. In conclusion there's many ways to reduce air pollution. There's also many advantages to banning usage of cars. Not only are people stress free and feeling good, but air-pollution decreases and Greenhouse gas emissions stop."

Although there are precautions the companys have taken to prevent accidents, something could always happen, and no company has found the answer to who is at fault if there is an accident. Driverless cars may seem like an exciting new way to travel, but there is not a way for the driver to completely relax. The driverless cars cannot drive where there is not a smooth course. If there is construction work or an accident the car can not drive, and requires the skills of a human, which makes the name ""driverless car"" falsely stated. The way the cars alert the driver that their assitance is needed, is just by annoucing that the driver needs to take over. This way of getting the driver's attention may not always end in success if the driver is distracted and not paying attention to the car or the road. Why not have a human drive instead? The driver has to always be alert and ready to take over in a driverless car, so why not just drive normally? It does not make sense for a driver to sit in a car and wait until they have to take over and drive, and that drive may only take five minutes. It is pointless to have a computer drive and to have the person in the driver's seat be alert. Driverless cars are also making it ""fun"" to drive in a car where a person is not needed nighty percent of the time. Some manufacturers are planning to bring in car entertainment systems, which is another distraction to drivers on the road. Also, not needing to drive gives people more opportunites to be on their cellphones, read road signs, or look at the scenary instead of the road. All of these distractions are giving drivers more reasons to not pay attention to the road, and will prevent them from taking over the car when the computer can no longer drive. Driverless cars are dangerous, but they do bring some goods to the table. Driverless cars are estimated to only use half of the fuel that regular cars use today, which can help the environment immensely. They are a new and exciting way to travel and get around, and if all the drivers are paying attention, can prevent accidents because of the sensors and cameras. Driverless cars are exciting, but they are dangerous and have never been tested in real situations, like a family going on vaction, or someone going to work. The outcomes are unknown, something can always go wrong, and no manufacturers know who will be blamed when something does go wrong. The cons outweigh the pros, driverless cars are dangerous and cannot be trusted to handle situations if a driver is not paying attention. Driverless cars should not be developed and sold."

Will I think by using this technology if it bring a smile to my face while it shows how much this computer can do. Then I might have to get it. Like if the computer no if im happy or sad in my emotion then thats a be a good feeling I dont know why but it will. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. So if you confused on something the computer could help or figure it out for you. I think its good because if the teacher is helping another students work the computer could help the kids or whoever. So I think it will be good for students to get a smart computer like that so when you do need help like that or feeling disgusted or fearful the computer will help. Like on her last asignment she could feel not knowing how to do things.Then you can calculate emotions like the math homework. In the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face in if you dont know how to work a app it will show you. But one reason why I dont know about it because one day you can be mad in not let no one know. Or want somebody to know whats going on with you. So I think thats probably one reason. Then you might not want help or want people seeing your emotion even the teacher. so thats the reason I probably would'nt get on the computer for that reason or some people probably just dont like the setting to it or probably want think its useful.. But last I think its valuable in someways in school or at home. Sometimes people dont know whats wrong with they body. They can get right on the computer in so the computer could tell them like your despress or things like thats. So I think its a good learning envoirment for the kids in grown ups.

17678,0,I think it's better to have a car because people that are driverless would get all lazy because they don't have to drive. People that needs to learn how to drive wouldn't be able to because they cars drives by itsself. People shouldn't be lazy to drive. Maybe one day when your in a hurry and the car you got is driving so slow that your going to be late to your appointment or whatever you going to. It would nice if they cars could tell them turn her or watch out or something like that. So the car can warn you guys incase of accendent. People should be responsible to drive theirselves to wherever they want to go. What if the car breaks down?? They won't have a way to go anywhere without it working. They would still have to buy the pieces or whatever to fix the car. if it was your own car you wouldn't even mind to buy the stuff you need because you know it's yours. Most people would be walking to places they need to go for the same reason of not having a car. The car could hurt the drivers. Safety is the most important thing in any car in the earth. People that drive with car be getting into acciedents imagine having cars that drives themselves. It would be worser for people. If the car goes to the other way where its not suppose to and get hit the person is the one that going to get the consequences for the cars action.

I have a fine time talking to people in the real world not a computer,if a computer made a weird face at me i would probalby get up and walk away from it. This is kind of dumb i think you should be able to know or ask some one about their feelings in the real world not on the computer pull up a weird face to show how they feel.

6336,0,"Picture this: you are a senior in high school who is taking multiple Advanced Placement (AP) classes. You are unable to attend your dream college because you have not previously participated in one single extracurricular activity. Now, you are very disappointed because you could have done one little thing to eliminate this problem. It may be too late for you, but you could prevent this problem from saddening many more students in the future. Taking up at least one extracurricular activity can benefit you in ways such as finding your passion and morphing your future, so requiring it is a must. First of all, being a part of a club or sports team can result in you finding your love for a specific activity. Personally, I experienced my love for running after joining my middle school's Cross Country team. Also, becoming exposed to many different activities at a younger age helps you decide what you prefer to do and not do. If you already love something not offered as a specific school activity such as photography, you can join the yearbook club at your school to use your talent of taking pictures. Many sports are also not offered, so you could talk to your principal about adding a specific activity to broaden your options. Secondly, having participated in a school extracurricular could be the difference in attending a specific college or not. The same goes for a desired workplace, as many companies require an extracurricular to be present on your resume. For example, if you participated in your school's drama club in middle school and high school, you are more likely to get into a theater class in college than someone who was not a part of their school drama club. Also, being a part of a club or sport can help you gain social skills, that way if you have to give a talk or write a book with someone, you will be prepared. With all that being said, many arguments arise. One popular argument is parents may not have the time to drop their child off at their club. The easy solution to this problem is that schools most likely have at least one after-school club that seems appealing for that child, which is very convenient because your child is at school anyways, so being dropped off is not necessary. Also, if your specific sport or club is not offered at your school, there is a very high chance that someone else does the same activity, and you can carpool together. Another argument is children may not have time to participate in a club due to homework. Because of this argument, many clubs allow you to complete your homework during their session time, or are only about an hour long, still giving you time to finish your homework at home. Lastly, some parents argue that they do not want to pay for their child to do an activity. Although some sports can be pricey, most school activities just have a small registration fee. Some clubs are even free! Therefore, doing what you love most and becoming a good employee both are a result of extracurricular activities. If that is going to be the case, why not require it? Although some good arguments arise, even better solutions rise higher. Do not let the absence of one activity ruin your academic dream. Overall, extracurricular activities help more than hurt, so add something fun to your schedule and receive the benefits of taking a little bit of time out of your day to unwind."
4462,0,"Summer projects are commonly used to keep students minds engaged and active during the long summer break away from school. Although this seems like a big burden to students who are looking to relax during the summer after a long school year, it is crucial to keep students minds thinking about school so they are not blindsided by the large wrok load they recieve during the school year. A big question about these summer projects is who should have a say in the design and makeup of the assigned summer projects. I believe summer projects should be designed by teachers, but students should also have a say in the topic of the assigned projects to maximize summer productivity and prepare students for what is to come. My main reasoning for why teachers should be the ones to design and have the final say in what project is to be completed during the summer is that they know what students will be expected to do during the upcoming school year. This means they can utilize the summer projects to help groom each student to be prepared for what is expected of them during the school year. If, for example, I were taking a chemistry class my senior year and it is the summer leading up to it, I would want my assigned project to help me understand what will be expected of me in that class. The summer project would be able to help me prepare for the school year and I would have a good understanding of what the class will be like if the project is designed correctly. School teachers have the best knowledge of what will be taught and expected of each student, so they have all the tools to design a perfect project that prepares students for the upcoming course. The summer projects can also be a good introduction into what will be learned in the upcoming year, which allows teachers to jump right into teaching as opposed to giving a long introduction to the course over an average of about 2 weeks. This gives students a chance to have an early understanding of topics that will be taught during the year, and can lead to better grades due to a deeper knowledge of topics as opposed to coming in cold and seeing the curriculum for the first time ever. Although it is important for teachers to design and assign the proper summer project, it is also important that students have a say in what they will be working on in their time off from school and stress. It is extremely difficult to stay engaged in a project during the summer because everyone has their mind set on seeing friends and going on vacation since it's supposed to be a break from learning. This is why I believe that it is vital for students to have some freedom in their summer projects to personalize it and make it about something they enjoy. I know from personal experiance that when I am assigned a summer project that is dull and sparks no pesonal interest, it makes the project dreadful. This makes the summer projects very difficult to complete because for kids it's hard to set our mind to something and work hard at it if we are not passionate about it. Obviously if students had complete control over the summer assignments, they wouldn't be very productive for anyone. Because of this, I feel the best way to assign a summer project is by teachers giving students a structured outline explaining what needs to be completed, while still giving students the freedom to make it about something they find interesting. This helps spark creativity in students while also providing them with the tools to be able to succeed in the upcoming school year. My last reason on why there should be a shared responsibility between students and teachers when assigning summer projects has to do with the completion of the assignment. As a student, I can say first hand that many students put off assignments till the last week of summer because no one wants to be working incredibly hard after doing it for an entire school year. That being said, there are many ways that teachers can find a common ground in what interests students but still benefits them. Despite popular beliefs, there are actually ways to make summer assignments enjoyable and not have them stress out students with an overwhelming workload. For example, If a teacher was assigning a math project to be completed over the summer, they could incorporate real life activities for students to go into the real world and collect data for a certain topic, and then have them form a project on their findings. This keeps students happy because although they still have to make a project, they are making it based off of their own research and findings in the real world. I believe this would maximize the completion of the product as it is interesting to students and keeps them being creative so it doesn't feel as much like a stressfull school assignment, but more like a personal project. In conclusion, it is important for teachers to have the overall responsibility to design the summer projects due to the fact that they know what the students need to prepare for, and can help them realize what will be expected during the school year. This will also benefit both the students and teachers in that the kids will already have an understanding of subjects, leading to less time wasted by teachers giving introductions. The student-teacher collaboration will help keep students interested in what they are completing, and help them have a mental drive to complete the assigned tasks, while also guiding them in the right direction to begin the next school year."
22630,0,"In the United States, some public schools offer what is called ""distance learning"", a program where students remain at home and take classes online, as an alternative option to attenting classes in the school building. There are clear benefits to more schools allowing students to take classes from their homes. Sick students will not find their education hindered, anxious students will not be forced to endure a group setting, and others may find themselves more open to self-directed online lessons. Firstly, it allows sick students to still take their classes, even while bedridden. In schools were students are required to be present in the classroom, sick students miss out on instruction and have to make up the work. Students who are enrolled in a distance learning program can continue to learn, even if they are unable to leave home. Distance learning can also have other benefits in the realm of health. In terms of mental health, students who suffer from severe social anxiety and have issues being around others would perfer an in-home learning experience. These students often find themselves unable to cope in the group setting of a school classroom, and unable to learn. The online courses or video conferencing of distance learning would allow these students to participate in school without risking a panic attack. Another benefit is allowing students a self-paced style of learning. The rigid structure and pacing of the classroom could be a ""turn-off"" for some students; distanced learning, at least in online classes if not video conferencing, offers a more relaxed and self-directed style. The student determines when they do the work, when they study new content, and for how long they work, with the only strict condition being the deadline when they have to turn it all in. Students enrolled in a self-directed online course may find themselves more engaged than if they were in a classroom. Distance learning is something all schools should implement. It would allow sick students to continue learning, allow anxious students the opportunity to learn while remaining in a safe environment, and provide a more engaging style of learning for others."
15330,0,"Dear TEACHER_NAME, Hello named STUDENT_NAME I don't think that you should make the students with a C average stop doing sports. The reason why I think that is because some students really love sports. Sports is like school you work as a team and you work hard on the job. I know there are students here who like sports and have excellent grades but not everyone. Some students were made to do great in school but some aren't. The main thing is that students that have bad grades shouldn't have to force themselves to doing a great job in school with all A' s and B' s because some thing may be difficult and they get a C on it. Also there is after school tutoring that way if they need help on any work they can stay with the teacher and catch up on what they need done or help on. For a example me I love school and sports and I don't have all A' s and B' s. At points you really have to think of what the students think they may have the same feeling but we want to have fun and do sports to support the schools and ourselves. So what I'm trying say just let the students have fun and be active and support our school with good grades and with being active. So then when they get older and what to be a professional athlete they have to have good grades to make it so I see where you get that from. Its very important to have good grades in life because school is what actually helps us on anything. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME"
1205,0,"What's the first thing you think about when you see a car? How much gas mileage its has? What year is it? How fast can it go? Well, have you ever thought about how much polution it puts into our air that we breathe? Or the car bill you have to pay every month? I'm going to assume you don't. There are ways we can change this problem and im going to prove how! To begin this argument im going to point out that over 77% of American people are in debt in their car bill, ALONE. That's over 3/4 of our population in the U.S. You cannot tell me people are not stressed from this over whelming statement! ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."", said by a former car owner Heidrun Walter. She now rides bicycles with her two children and now a car bill is one less thing she has to worry about in her hectic life. Another advantage of limiting car usage would be do reduce smog polution. Now this is not only a problem in America, it's all over the world. Paris is particularly bad in this division. Paris typically has more smog that other European capitals. It got so horrible they has to enforce a ""driving ban"" to ensure all the air was clear in the global city. It even rivaled Beijing, China which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. After about five days the congestion on the streets plumitted down to 60%. Having said that, not only is car usage bad for our earth, we could benifit our health from it! In Bogota, Columbia they set up a program named ""Car free day."" Millions of their citiznes hiked, climbed, skated or took bus transportation to work. This day left the streets empty with no traffic, and the people that did drive had a $25 fine. Rain or shine nothing could stop these people from participating in this event. The city benifited from this so much that parks and sport centers have boomed from high demand because people want to have a healthier lifestyle in general. One day they hope every city has something simlilar to this day so that our owlrd will be heathier and even happier! Therefor it is clearly obvious of the advantages we would have if we limited on car usage. People would be alot healthier not only from the excersise, but the air would be alot more cleaner to breathe in. Also it would be safer and cut down tremendously on deaths. We might just be over the peak of driving."
22419,0,"Could attending classes from home via online or video conference be a beneficial option that schools offer? I believe it would be a good option to have for those having problems with bullying. Bullying is still a big problem across the world causing depression among young teens. Having online school as an option for those who go through harassment and or assault could help decrease the rate of depression among teens. Another factor is getting more sleep. Typically when teachers ask how much sleep their students get at home the in my experience the usual response is five to six hours. The recommended amount of sleep teens should be getting at least is eight hours and at most ten. The teachers on the other hand aren't surprised by those numbers the students come out with due to how many of them play sports and take AP classes. This can also cause a lot of stress like on test days, important sports competitions, or cramming in assignments last minute because other classes are assigning multiple projects due in the same week. Attending classes at home would mean they have the option to start thier classes at a later time assuring that they can sleep in in the morning to get the extra few hours they're missing out on. Not getting enough sleep effects the productivity of the student which could prevent them from finishing papers on time then having their grades drop. Which could all lead into depression. Making friends at school can be pretty difficult, especially at schools where there are ""social classes."" For example: A teen who is more anti-social would have a harder time than someone who is much more comfortable talking with big crowds. Or even someone whose being bullied or have a mental issue they can't do anything about. This could also induce stress to the teen when assigned a group project or assignment. Attending an online course would help them in that manner of not being comfortable around others. Could not having friends also be a problem? Not having friends could also cause depression in the teen which could lead into showing less effort and not having motivation to complete assignments. Would taking classes at home make the teen become lazy? Its possible to happen due to the work environment, it could definitely cause distractions like working next to the television or their cellular device. As long as the teen can be in a closed environment with less distractions it should not be that big of a problem. It is also likely that they try and cheat on assignments, but it would more or less show when taking a test without knowing the required knowledge that they just took off of the internet. In conclusion attending online course could be beneficial to those struggling to attend school while dealing with bullying, stress, and or depression. It can also help work on their independence in the future with colledge or a day job. Even though it can also cause a few problems like laziness, it can easily be solved through motivation. Overall it should be provided by more schools so that parents can consider it an option."
7818,0,"If my principal had decided that ALL students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity for example students could participate in sports, work on the year book, or serve on the student council. I would strongly disagree because there is people like me that dont want to do sports and would just rather go straight home after along day of school or some could not physically do sports or stuff like that and lastly i think i will just make students mad so you will have a lot of students yelling and talking back and not doing what they are supposed to do. I don't think you should be forced to play a sport or something like that because if you want to do it you will do it so there is no need to be force by principal. After school people just want to go home school is long enough so having an after school activity will just make some people upset and because I will be mad if i get forced to participate in an activity that will take time out of my day, and besides people have stuff to do also after school, some people dont have time for that. Some students have disabilities so some of them won't be able to do that stuff and they have to go straight home after school. i'm just saying if the principal does that there will be a lot of complaints for example why do they have to do it and we have stuff to do this is not fare. If all the students will be forced to do something like that they will all be tired the next day because some people are just not used to it like me for example. I dont think it is wrong sports are very good for you for example sports are good exercise and you could try something new, and you could even learn that you like a sport, but if some one wants to do an activity or play sports they can do it on there own they dont have to be forced for that stuff if you want to do it you will do it if you dont you shouldn't be forced that just going to make the students mad and aggressive. That should be something you supposed to do on your own."
4583,0,"Projects abilities brings out a person's perspective on subjects or topics, which outbursts into a creativity mindset that some people might consider they never have. Mostly, school's resembles into that category. Teachers gives out assignments, homework's, and projects in return of students showing work ethic and independence. In other cases, some teachers prefer giving out student's projects to complete during breaks. However, teacher's do not take in consideration upon us students on deciding the designs on these projects before breaks. Because students have their own ways of techniques on projects, students should be in control of designing projects. During breaks, students initially will mostly tend to work on the project last minute or genuinely forget about it. Which takes on how the projects are given. A teachers material may become abstract. For example, "" List the following:..."". Or even, "" Explain the following:.."". Because of this, it makes learning somewhat frustrated. Students loves to focus more on credibility. Another example is, making the topic into a story lines or even poems. It shows students that they comprehend the bigger picture of the project. Also, understanding the language of learning, making it to be more satisfying to do during in school or outside of school. A student would strongly try and do the project but if the materials that's given by teachers is unsatisfying, it becomes harder on student to complete. People who have more experiences than others are most likely to be more beneficial. Students, like me, likes to explore new things throughout the school year. Working on the same materials makes others hesitate to break out their comfort zone to explore new things. Teachers usually stick with one material throughout the semesters. For example, my English elementary professor, Generic_Name, had all his students remember one specific way to brainstorm ideas. Until, throughout my years in English, I learned from other professors that it's more than one remarkable way to brainstorms ideas. It's beneficial to show others your perspectives in things so they can take on the ideas you explore and find their own way of brainstorming. Designing our own projects will be more than just a grade. Each process will become tremendously easier and grow on us for our next future projects to become perfect. Summer projects should be a place where student's loves to work while being out of school. A place where they can sit and create incredible projects. If a student create their own ideas, the turnout will mostly be successful. It shows a student true hard work and dedication.."
25592,0,"Being close-minded to others opinion isn't always the best choice, when having more than one opinion you can learn and experience new things. My first reason why having more than one opinion on something gives you a better point of view on the decision you're about to make or the advice you're seeking. For example if you can't decide on what ice cream flavor is better vanilla or chocolate, you can ask a friend which seems tastier than others. They're obviously gonna say chocolate. However, if its a life changing decision make sure that you get more than one opinion, it'll most likely help you make a better choice. My next reason is when making an important decision by yourself is difficult and nerve-racking when you don't have someone to help you. Only having one point of view might not be the right mindset or choice. It can put a lot of stress on a person if they don't have a second opinion or someone supporting them. Some people need that extra support or need someone to tell them that they're wrong, not saying that they're always wrong, but thinking negatively can lead to bad decision making. My last reason on why seeking multiple opinions is good is sometimes you're not sure if its the wrong thing to do, and getting the right advice from someone you can trust. Receiving different opinions might help you change your opinion on something and help you view stuff differently. A big part in decision making is getting your advice from someone you trust and also someone that is honest with you. Sometimes with the wrong advice from the wrong person might not help you make the right choice. In conclusion receiving more than one opinion is good so you can keep and open mind to new stuff and have different views. Having your own opinions is important but just be open to others opinions."
14427,0,"Dear Principal, Doing community service is important because it's helping out the world. The students do it because they want to and because they care not because they have to. If you create a program where they could sign up for community service because they want to, then that will be fine. If you make it mandatory to do community service, then there will be a lot of complaints. Basically, if you make the students do community service, you'll be going against what they want. Some of them actually have things to do like extracurricular activities or out of school plans that are important. The best thing to do, would be to require all of the students to do community service at least once a month for extra credit. You can also give them a choice of doing it more than once or just once. Therefore, The students will be able to keep their plans and they'll still be helping out. Also, you could make it mandatory for anyone that has a write-up because they could do community work as a punishment. But making students who are innocent do it even if they don't want to will make it seem like a punishment. The students will tell their parents and the parents will call the school complaining. Giving the students a benefit will definitely get them to help out. Its good that some of the students do community work without a benefit or something in return. Those students are inspired to help out and feel that it is neccessary. The other students that don't want to help out always wants something in return so maybe giving them extra credit will help. These are just some ideas that will still have students doing community service but also won't go overboard with the concept. Sincerely, An 8th grade student"
1158,0,Phones & Driving Cell phones one of the most important technology in today world since cells phones have been created almost no one can do without them. Phones are so important to us that we need them in case of emergency. family or friends that are away from us or international from a different county. we all known that driving is one of the number one cause of death. While driving is a privilege we have today. When you text and drive you not only put yourself at risk you put innocent drives at stake. Just recently the state of Georgia ban the use of cell phones while driving. I believe there is no text back to that person that can not wait. We should take life precious. in the UK cell phones are banned. I believe all call phones should be banned. Recently researchers have come up with a way of using our phones while driving. In order to do that they have came up with advanced vehicle that we can make phone calls with touching our phones by using the aux. I hope as we move forward in life people can learn from each other's mistakes. Texting while driving is the worst thing to do you can. loose your privilege or suspended license. Even worse you could kill someone while walking. So the question is does it really worth texting while driving?
6297,0,"The position of the principal is good because some people in schools just wake up go to school and go home right after that, but with this decision this way the students can interact with other people and learn about different things going on in the world and can give them a chance to try something new. This decision will help with creating friendships with different people but also will be able to make some student get out of their comfort zone and interact with people. Some people may not have liked this decision because maybe they go home and hang out with their neighbor but they go to a different school and that school didnt want that disition so they are bored have nobody to play with. Its a good decision because it gets people out of their houses and more than just the average day of school. It help with that by getting people to stay after school and gives them a chance to hand out with their friends or to make new friends. It also just plain lets them have fun with a club. Getting to get out of the house also can also help if your parents are always just nagging you to get out of the house and do something this way you can go to a creative club for almost any subject like SGA, art club,strategy games club,video games club, or even stay after for a sport. you have so many disitions to choose from all you need to do is get out of your comfort zone and try something new. Another great thing about the principals disition is that it gives everyone something new to do and to get you out of your comfort zone. This some what helps people get out of their comfort zone and do something with their lives. It also helps with someone who doesnt have the time to go to a sport after school this helps. It would definitely help with my family because my little brother has his own sports after school so if I stay after school then I can pick him up and not have to wait bored at home for another two hours just to get him. If you are trying to make some new friends but still hang out with your friends then you can just get a teeacher and some of your friends and create your own club so that other people if they are fasinated by your club then they can join your club. With the principals desision I still think that with it that the school will be able to know their students and try to get them to get out of their homes and also get them to try something new. By this desision the students will be more well rounded and be able to do someting that they love to do. They will also be able to hang out with their school friends and not have to worry about trying to get home from each others houses where at the school they have buses to get home."
20936,0,"In my opinion i believe that our principle should consider the choice on having students use their cell phones during the school day. I think it would be a good idea if our teachers or our principle give students permission to use cell phones during lunch and other free times that we have, as long as we don't use them during our class time. One of the reasons why i think it's a good idea to consider the choice on having cell phones during school time is because there can be an emergency at home and our parent's can either text us or call us.! As long as we pay attention to our teachers during class i think it would be an awesome idea. I think it would be dumb if our principle doesn't consider the choice to let us bring cell phones to school because either way student bring them and they still use them during class time so if our principle doesn't consider this idea it would be the same either way. But i think it would be better if she does choose to let us students use our cell phones during a free time or during lunch. Students would use their cell phones freely without trying to hide from a teacher or an adult while using a cell phone, without believing they are getting their phone's taken away. So i really believe that our principle should really go back and think about these options. Students would be more than happy to have the permission to use their cell phone and I also believe that they wouldn't take advantage of their permission to use cell phones, but that's just my opinion on this case, other student might think different than me, so that's why i think that our principle should really think about this opinion."
23945,0,"I think students could benefit on attending classes from home because it's less distractions and they're in their own comfortable environment. When students are at school in most cases they find it distracting because there are a lot of students in class and some of those students are loud therefore, it disturbs the other students and it can be irritating trying to listen to the teacher and do work while others keep talking, yelling, or being being loud while you're trying to concentrate on what you have to do. But when you're home schooled you can be disturbed here and there but it's less disturbing then being around a lot of noisy students and students that turn their headphones up all the way so you can here their music is also a distraction to students and if you're at home doing the work, you're in your own zone. Being at home also helps if you're nervous around other students or you don't like being around big crowds. When you're at home if feels more comfortable because you're around an environment you know well and that you're used to. You also have your parents at home to help you with your work and your parents keep you on track with your work. It also helps being independent at home by yourself and doing work online because some adults do that when they're in college and have to take online classes. Another reason is because some students might get bullied and if they feel they're not ready for school then, they should be home schooled so they mentally and physically don't become damaged. If a student says he or she is getting bullied then changing schools can also be beneficial but, I feel like having them home schooled would help them a lot more so they can get more comfortable and find it in themselves that they are ready to be in school again. It can also be a big stress relief for the student as well because they find peace in their own home that they like for an example if the student has a pet that can be relaxing for them and therapeutic to the student and have them calm while doing work because the student can rub the pet to focus more and be calm. Student also need experience in school to know how it feels,but in all if the student likes it better in their own home I think that is most important and what ever makes the student comfortable so they can keep striving and become successful."

The value of returnung to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive. I think if we can study Venus up close we'll get a better understanding of the planet, like what materials it has and how the weather conditions are. NASA has a compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. A blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the rolling Venusian landscape. However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground. To meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."
18799,0,"Dear Senator, I am arguing in favor of changing the Electoral College to the election of by popular vote. The process of the votes going through the various different places until it finally gets counted and determined who wins the state is unneccesary. The system is not even fair, for example in the year 2000 Al Gore had one the popular vote by 60%. Unfortunatley he lost the presidency because he did not win the the votes of the Electoral College. For a counry that is ran by the people, a vote of over 50% should always win. When you take into consideration how big the United States are, then cut that into half it is still a remarkable amount. Now picture a little over half the people in the United States voting for the same thing. This process led to the ""biggest election crisis in a century"" says Bradford Plumer. According to this source the system can also allow for much worse. He even says that at the most basic level the Electoral college is unfair to voters because of the Winner-take-allsystem that occurs in each state. For the purpose of common sense why would we as a republic use a system that is ""unfair""? Richard A. Posner says that the method of using the Electoral College method may even restrain potential voters for a specific candidate. All because they know that they're votes will have little to no impact on the outcome of the election. This also leads to the fact that would have no logical reason to pay attention to the campaign they would've picked. Plumer quotes that "" the Electoral College is outdated,unfair, and that Bob Dole was right in saying that we as acounty should abolish the Electoral College"". When everything is added up the same words such as unfair,outdated,useless, and unnessary keep coimg up on this topic. Not everybody in this country enjoys the use of the Electoral College and I strongly feel that eventually in this country the Electoral college will be left in the past and new methods of voting will be of greater use."
778,0,"Phones & Driving Now in the 21st century, the major of humans own and use cell phones daily. The number of teens who are dying or being injured as a result of texting while driving has skyrocketed as mobile device technology has advanced. Texting while driving is a big problem though out the world with the death rate going up every year. Teens and young adults ages though 18-24 are texting and driving more than any other age group. Texting while driving increases the chances of a person having an accident greatly for being distracted. Driving while texting is as dangerous as driving drunk. Driving while texting, as with drunk drivers, are less likely for a person that's texting to notice any signs, people walking in the middle of the road, and the signals coming from other vehicles. The larger phone manufacturers, such as Apple and Samsung, could help put something in their phones like an app, or app blocker, to help texters with their problem. About over 300,000 injuries have occurred every year by accidents caused by texting while driving in 25% of all car accidents resulting in almost 400,000 physical injuries. 550 pedestrians and bicyclists are killed each year in distracted driving accidents. The poor habits of texting while driving would keep on going nonstop once a person gets used to texting while driving, there is no telling where it will stop. Texting while driving does not encourage a person to care about their surroundings and fosters a sense of detachment from the world at large. Constantly texting, along with nonstop waiting for that next text to come popping up on your phone screen, looking like a robot is no way to live. The ability to enjoy life and carry on a conversation in person is completely and diminished. Putting down the phone for a few minutes each day could help with your communication skills, and your phone would be put down for once for some rest. Texting while driving is in the 21st century has changed the way of driving nowadays while technology keeps on advancing the problems gets bigger and bigger and while the death rate would keep on increasing as time goes until everyone fix the texting while driving problems continues."
10246,0,"INTRODUCTION: A brand new software has been developed. This software improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others; This new software has promising applications for a variety of industries. Imagine a computer can tell how you're feeling just from your face, like for example you go to a computer and ask her how am I feeling today, then the computer will say= 83%happy, 9%disgusted, 6%fearful, 2%angry; And you'll be like WHAT?, how can a simple computer make such a thing?. The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D model of the face, with 44 major muscles this is called ""action unit"". Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System) BODY: Dr. Huang observes that the facial expressions for each emotion are universal and humans perform the same impressive ""calculation"" every day; How?: you can probably tell how is your friend feeling just looking at him or hearing his voice. This software could change the whole world; For example imagine you are in the ethernet and then a web ad player pop's up, if you smile at it a similar ad might follow; But if you frown, the next ad will be different. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" Dr. Huang predicts. CONCLUSION: Moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also can help produce them; we unconsciously imitate person's facial expressions. So in conclusion I would say that we can start using this magnificient software and his technology to read student's emotional expressions because it could also help teacher's to see how their student's are doing and if someone is distracted or bored the computer will notice the teacher so he/she can move on into another thing or go talk with the student."
10805,0,"Peoples emotions can be hard to detect most times. Personally, my friends have gotten very good at faking emotions. Detecting how someone really feels in nearly impossible for the human brain. For example, in the article it states that the Mona Lisa is, ""83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry."" Being able to detect all of those emotions in just looking or talking to someone just isn't as easy as it seems. Thats why they came up with ""the Facial Action Coding System."" This system has been developed to improve the accuracy in perceiving ones emotions. Frst, the way this system will work is when the computer constructs a 3-D compter model of a face. The computer will be able to detect the emotion of a person when they see the muscles in their face. To be able to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom will be very benificiary when it comes to how they feel about the thing the school is teaching them. If we continue to advance in technology like we have, then using the computers for lessons will be able to detect weather the child is interested or not. The article states that, "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becomming confused or bored."" That way when a child is confused, for those who are too scared to ask for help, the teacher could be alerted and try their best to help the child or maybe even change lessons. Secondly, the computer system could also be very helpful in a school because of teenage kids and their problems. If a student is feeling very down, then the computer could detect that and try to get help for them. In the world today there are many kids who suffer from depression and anxiety, sometimes school can be too much for them. Therefore, when doing school work if the computer can detect the sadness or overwhelming confusion causing their anxiety to rise it could help them out a lot. The article states that, ""In the real smile, the zygomatic major lift the corners of your mouth, while a fake smile the mouth is stretched sideways, using zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" This would help the computer detect kids from being actually happy, or just faking it for everyone else. Third, the computer system could help with kids who struggle with anger. Maybe school makes them angry, or they struggle with the work. With the school fights in the past, and future, i belive this would help detect how kids feel. The computer could watch what the child proceeds to look up on the internet, while also detecting how the child feels. This way, if a child shows signs of harm to themselves or to others, the computer could inform the school and try to give help to the kid. I believe this would only improve the safety of schools while also offering help to the ones that need it. Fourth, I believe the computer system could help those of us who tend to get very bored or tired. This way when a child is bored or tired the teacher has a way of fixing the problems, or doing more interesting ideas to help you stay focused. Personally, i tend to get very bored when school comes up to topic, so if my teacher had a way of making it interesting for me that would be awesome! I also tend to get very tired so if my teacher is alerted of a child getting sleepy, we could do exercise or stretches to help wake us up. This computer system would help school coorporations tremendlously because of all the problems kids go through. I believe that every school computer should have this sytem, because i think the techers could have a chance to keep children interested and awake. This could possibly improve attendance and graduation percetages. Getting a kid engaged and interested can be very difficult but i belive this stystem would help a lot! As the article states, "" Whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions!"" Truly amazing and helpful!"
16220,0,"Dear Principle, I think it not fair that people that have B' s or an A' s could join a sport or another activity. i Find it unfair. I have many reasons to tell You why its not fair. i would at least tell you three things why it not fair that people that have A or B average get to join a sport or another activity. First of all, Its not fair because you never know if your students have been working hard to pass there classes. Maybe they are working there butt off to pass but maybe they might find there classes harder Because what they say the older you the harder it gets in school. Second of all, I think you should let people that actually want to learn join activity's or join a sport, and the people that don't want to learn they could get everything taken away like there break or lunch and give them back there freedom when they actually do better. Just don't take away the people that are trying to do better there fun. Third of all, I find it un fair that mostly people that have B' s and A' s get to join a sport because that makes the other people feel bad. Everyone can join a sport or an activity because school is like family and we get to do what other people do to. So That's why i find it unfair because that people with A' s and B 's get to join activity's"

Most of it is caused by teenagers because they do not know between what is right and what is wrong. teens around the world resolved to violence, affecting others around them. Most of it is caused by bullying. Years ago the government allowed students to attend online courses and a good amount of students left high school and stayed to take online courses. Students should attend online courses because bullying would decrease nand it would be easier to find your way through the website instead of walking from class to class. Bullying would have a major decrease because students would be at home instead of school. Everyday students get harassed by other students and then up to the point where it drives them to commit suicide. Students would be at their house where it's safe and less distracting. Also, some students are too shy to be around other people so they get bullied for it. Every parent doesn't want to see their kid get bullied. There so much negativity being spread around and it not only affects the victims life it also affects their families. It would be easier to find your way through online courses instead of walking class to class. It could be difficult for some students to find their way around the school because of how big it might be. With only the press of a few buttons, students would easily find their way towards their next assignment. Others may think that taking online courses are a waste of time. Parents question the school district "" if we have teachers then why do we need online courses?"". Some students would feel a bit depressed knowing that all their friends are at school and they are the only ones at home looking at a monitor. It is more likely that kids won't be able to learn that way because they'll be distracted by other things. Students would prefer to be with their friends and listen to a teacher in person and have less work."
24906,0,"Going to someone to ask for advice is one of the most hardest things a person can do. It is like taking away candy from baby or saying the word,""No"", to somebody. People think that it is easier to make a choice with his or her own opinion, but in reality it's not. It will always be hard, but it is better to get an outside opinion on something. People think that asking for advice is the craziest thing in the world, but it may actually help. It can help with many problems someone may face. It is always better to get multiple opinions because it can help you solve a problem, see other viewpoints and not just your own, and it helps you think about the problem more clearly. Although asking someone about advice is hard, it can help solve the problem. Getting someone else's opinion can help you make a decision faster. It can also help you look at the facts and not what you think about it. If you just think about your opinion, the problem will never go away. It may feel like it's the longest thing in the world, but it could just be a few minutes. The most important thing would be how it can give you solutions to help fix the problem you're stuck with. There are many issues a person can have, but it helps to listen to other people's viewpoints. It can help you see what other people have to say. Also, getting other people's thought or viewpoints can help you learn about how they feel. There are many things that people can say or do, but it can help you make a choice of what to do. This will be hard because making a choice is like breaking ice. On the other hand, it will be relieving to get the advice. It may be struggling to do, but having more opinions can make you think about the problem more clearly. For instance, it can help you think of the problem with a more peaceful mindset. A person's advice can help you think about the problem from someone else's point of view. If you are someone else's shoes, it can help you realize what you might've not seen. Also, thinking about the problem more clearly can help you think about what you can do to fix it. The advice given to you can help you see why the problem is going on. Then, it may be easier to solve or help fix the problem. To conclude, it is always better to take someone's advice to heart. Many people struggle with asking for advice, but it becomes more easy over time. It is like when you learn something new, it is always better to ask for help when you are having trouble. If you ask for multiple opinions on something, it can help the outcome of your decision. That is why getting opinions can help you solve problems, see other viewpoints, and give you a better mindset to think more clearly."
18994,0,"When you think of the USA the first word that you think of is freedom or a word along those terms. I would have to agree with you we are a very free and fair country for...most things like voting I would have to say that the Electoral Collage is the one unfair thing we have and their are many reasons why we should replace the Electoral Collage with popular vote. The Electoral Collage is when voting for the president, instead of dierectly voting you have electors represnt your state during elections. The Electoral Collage is made up of 538 electors, you have one elector for every member of the Congressional deleagtion and House of Representives plus two for the Sentors this is per state then they all come together to represnt during the election of the president. This is how the Electoral Collage is set up it all seems fair but you, yourself arent having a fair chance to vote for who you want as the president, its like haveing someone make your dessions for you its just unfair. The Electoral Collage is set up so the electors vote for who they want to win surely one of your electors will vote for who you want but its not enough you basically have no voice during elections. Bradford Plumers The Indefsible Electoral Collage he says ""At the most basic level, the electoral collage is unfair to voters, because of the winner take all system in each state"" he then says "" The candidates only spend time in the swing states where they know they have a chance of winning""; he is pointing out that those who are running for president spend a mojortity of their time in the states where they can get the most amount of votes for example they might campain to Florida or Washington DC but not even go to a state like Wyoming or Idoh. I think we should have the popular vote because it goves everyone a chance to vote for the president, they can voice their opions out loud and have a chance at seeing who they want in office. Another reason the Electoral Collage is unfair is because the electors might all be Republican or all Democrat but we as voters dont get a chance to pick what party we stand for, with popular vote you have a chance to say who you want and what party you represent weather its Republican, Democrat or Induvial you at least get the chance and even though its only a 25 percent chance who you vote for is going to win at least its still a chance. Popular vote has its many advantges but one of the best is you can ""get to know"" who your voting for the canidates can come to your state and make speechs, have posters something to tell you what they are planning on doing if they get elected, this gives every state a fair chance to see who they are voting for. And yes they might spend a longer time in New york then Ohio but at least their spending time and educating the people on what they want to do and why the people should vote for them. Know I know theres alot of arguments on why we should have the Electoral Collage so let me get to that. In Richard A Posners In Defense of the Electoral Collage he states that the Electoral Collage is good because of the "" swing states"" wich he then says "" The voters in toss-up states are more likely to be the most thoughtful voters because they know they are going to decide the election"" in saying this he means that people who live in swing states will be more careful and more thought out on who they want to vote for. Yes this might be true but what about all the non swing states like for example Texas they could have been careful while voting but Florida was not, then you have Ohio and New Mexico who could have been careful to but compared to Florida their votes get lost even though they were more careful and thoughtout. So as you can see popular vote is more fair and also a smarter method of things it gives the peoplle a fair chance to vote for who they want while also allowing them to voice thier thoughts."
12816,0,"As exciting as alien formations on Mars would be, claiming the Face is of extraterestrial origin is like stating Old Faithful was dug by cavemen. Nature can take a plethora of exotic forms. We know this from exploring the many natural wonders of our own world, Earth. That is why we can't jump to an irrational conclusion when faced with an irregular occurance. You see, from a non-subjective view point, there is no face at all. There is an area in your brain dedicated to breaking down the world around you and associating it with familiar objects and patterns. This is why you may see a rabbit amoungst the clouds or a butterfly in an ink-blot test. When it came to a low-resolution image of Martian rock formation with conveniently placed shadows, it only took a fraction of a second for our brains to automatically associate its appearance with something humans see everyday; a face. In reality, there's no more of a face in the Face than there is an angel in an abstract painting. Furthermore, evidence from NASA's most recent expodition has highlighted the Martian formation for what it truly is. Compliments of rapidly evolving technology, Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) sent in 2001 captured a brilliant, high-quality image of the Face. With the camera's 1.56 meter per pixel resolution, it greatly shed a more vivid light on the planet in comparison to the original 43 meters per pixel camera used by the Viking 1 in 1976. Now the formation could be identified as a natural butte or mesa on Mars. It is very similiar to the rock formations one would find in western regions of the United States. Since we know such rock forms are created by natural processes such as erosion, the theories of aliens can be firmly put to rest. I will not completely disperse the possibility of foreign life forms outside of Earth; however, the Face is definitely not a product of an ancient civilization. As new data is gathered about the Red Planet, more anomilies will inevitably arise. Curiousity is the essance of human nature, so we will undoubtly explore each mystery and may yet come across new signs of life. Despite being just a rock, the Face had positive effects in sparking the public's interest in Mars. Perhaps one day very soon we'll have humans walking amoung the planet's rust-colored surface, trekking into the unknown."
2005,0,"It is an innovative idea from may people to cut down on the use of a motor vehicle. in these passages it gives pros on the better enviormental way of living. The first source talks about a city that is in Germany called Vauban, where residents have accepted the challenge of no car usage. The city is designed for walking to department stores, grocery stores, ect. But this so what utopia is not all a utopia itself, where 30 percent of families own cars. Also the United States Enviornmental Proctection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities like Vauban. This action to have a car reduced communites was because of the damage done by cars on the enviornment by pollution. The second and third source is about how a city took matter into their own hands and had a ""car free day"". In the cities of Paris and Columbia is where it took place. First the reasons why is because of near-record pollution of poulltion in the enviornment of Paris. Where on Columbia the reason for the car frre day was because they want to promote alternative transportation and smog. In Coulmbia this day has been going on three years straight! In the last source, it tells about how car culture is ending slowly. In the United States pople have been ""buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" A study shows that driving by young people has decreased by 23 percent from 2001 and 2009.

21608,0,"Dear Principal, My name is STUDENT_NAME. I have read and understood that you are considering to two policies for cell phone usage in your school. I have read both and i think that the best policy is that you allow the students to have their phones during lunch and other free times. I think this is best because giving students the time to have their phones out when there is free time gives them the time that they need to have their own personal time. When students are having to hide their phone in class this just makes more interruptions for the teacher to have to handle, but if they had their phone out in free time then there would be less interruptions for the teacher and the students wouldn't have to worry so much for getting caught with it or having to hide it. I think that giving these students the chance to have a little bit more freedom and not having to hide everything that they do would make the classroom more comfortable for the students and the teacher as well. Teachers make students feel like children when the students are getting yelled at for having phones and it just makes the whole class become uncomfortable to them. When the students have a feeling to hide something such as a cell phone, they become self aware and make things very uncomfortable for the whole class. Letting students have their phone would give them the freedom to talk with the people they wanted to without interruptions and there would be more peace and not so much tension throughout the school. When the students are hiding their phones behind books or papers they are more likely to get caught and get in trouble with not only the school but the parents as well. Letting them have their phones during acceptable times would let them have the freedom to talk but it would still make the classroom a better place in whole by teaching them but still letting them have their own personal time. Thank you for your time, STUDENT_NAME"
22517,0,"Students should not be allowed to take distance classes at their schools. Being at home, taking classes on a computer all day is not good for you. There are many problems that occur when you get no social interaction in real life. It is important to make coversations with people in person, the amount of work completed would decrease, and there would not be as many memories made. The importace of in real life interaction is huge! There is a big difference between talking to someone face to face, and talking to someone over the internet. Many people are not scared to say whatever they want on the internet, while in person they are very timid or hesitant to express themselves. Making students go to school and interact with people helps them slowly break out of their shell and become more willing to talk to people. But if students stay at home and take classes and never talk to people, it would be nearly impossible to break out of that shell. The amount of work that is completed and turned in would drop dramaticly. If you think about it students hardly do their homework, so why would they do classwork at home? They would not and this would lead to a drop in grades. A person that is for the distance classes could say that they could attend class even while they are sick. But even if that is true if they are too sick to go to school they will probably not pay attention to the class thats on their computer. A big thing they would miss out on is the memories. There are so many times where someone messes up something and the whole class starts laughing, or the teacher assigns a fun class activity that makes the whole day better. You just can not get that same excitment of having fun in person through a computer screen. The worst part would be making zero memories with your friends in school. You can not talk to your friends in between classes and joke around because you would not be in the hallways. You would be behind a screen waitiing for your next class to start which is no fun. When you think about the importance of social interactions and then think about distance classes it is really a no brainer what the answer is. Students need that interaction in order to develop important skills that they will use for the rest of their lives. So students need to keep going to school and take normal face to face classes."
519,0,"Phones & Driving Cell phones have become an addiction to the human race. We as humans tend to use them for everything in our lives. People use their cell phone for communication, social media, alarms, schedules planning, etc. Often times people are so distracted by their cellular device that people use them at the wrong time. One of those wrong times are when people use their phone while operating a vehicle. It is dangerous for people to use their phone while driving. There are a lot of issues that can come with using your phone while driving. Others lives are put into danger, fatal car crashes, accidents and using your phone shows that you are willing to risk your own personal safety. According to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, 1.2 million car crashes in 2013 involved drivers talking on the phone, and at least 341,000 involved text messaging (teendriversource. org). ""Statistics show that the use of a cell phone behind the wheel reduces the amount of brain activity associated with driving by 37 percent (teendriversource. org)."" Distractions from cell phones cause death rates to go up. Society has a bad addiction of being on their cell phones for long periods of time. This addiction is causing people to be distracted while driving. Many people have been in car accidents where people were brutally injured and some have had fatal accidents. Not only did the distracted driver hurt the opposing driver but the loved ones of the opposing drive goes through a lot. Their loved one might be hurt and need full time care or they may have to plan a funeral. Situations like these should make us think about the actions we take. Society should pull away from their phones to save others lives and save heartbreak from others. Most adults think it is the teenagers that are causing the problems with distraction of cell phones. Adults are a big problem when it comes to being distracted with cell phones while driving. However, society should not accuse each other but we should work together on making a change in cell phone usage. In conclusion, society should take time out and stop being selfish about using their phones while driving. People should stop trying to check their messages, read the latest tweet, or catch up on the latest post on instagram. Society should think about the safety of themselves and the safety of others. Waiting until your next destination to check your phone could help bring down the death rates of fatal car accidents. Our states have laws in place that demand that we don't text while driving. People have bought devices to hold their cell phone on their car dash but that doesn't help. The driver tends to look a the phone instead of the road. They especially look at the phone when making a video call. The purpose of driving is to arrive at our next destination safely. Face to face conversation should be practiced more and that could decrease the use of cellphones while driving. Everyone should stay safe and keep the world safer by focusing on the road and not our cellular device. Work Cited ""Cell Phones.""

Plus the they sent to mars was just taking pictures of a landing site for viking 1's sister viking 2. The first time they saw the face was when it was all shadowy so you could barely see it but as time past by it was 1998 when they went back up to mars with oe of the vikings to take another picture and it was more clear. They had to 12 years to go back up to mars and I dont think that aliens could build it that fast, it would've at least taken more time to make a good face. Then at the year 2001 they took another picture and it was fading away and I honestly dont think that the aliens would be able to take the face down that fast and why would they have to take it down. It has to be natural because there are no suh things as aliens, because no one from nasa has ever seen one and if they would've Nasa would've told everybody that they have found aliens and that they are real. Also I know its natural because even nasa said that the face had a nose,eyes,mouth, and looked exactly like a humans face. How would an alien know what a humans head looks like? When nasa was taking pictures the head from a red planet called cydonia was looking back at the camera. Also maybe the head only appears on different years."
17704,0,"The aritcle "" Driverless Cars Are Coming "" talks about negative and positive asapects of driverless cars. I agree with the development of these cars because they help people out, they're smart cars, and people would be saving there money by not having to buy another car. All of these are good ideas to have driverless cars in the near future. These new cars can be a big help to many people in genreal. If a person doesn't want to drive and is to lazy too, then that is what the cars are here for. Drivers can rest while the car is taking the wheel, but they would have to be in alert because there might be situatuons where there is work zones and would have to use our human skills to go around it. These cars can also warn drivers about certain things, such as pulling out of a driveway and making the driver look back and check if there are any cars. These new and developed cars are also smart and can warn a driver with anything. Manufactures plan on using cameras to wtahc the driver have there eyes on the road and nowhere else. This would be a good idea because many people use there phone while driving. Either they are texting or talking to someone on the phone which is dangerous. This idea about using cameras to see if drivers are paying attention on the road would decrease the number of accidents and deaths. A good idea that they also came up with is to use flashing lights on the windshield to give the driver a heads up that it's there turn to take over the wheel which I feel is a good idea because if they're asleep then the flashing lights can wake them up instantly. Another reason to get the driverless cars in the future is that a lot of people can't afford cars and they're stuck walking or riding there bike to school or to work. You won't have to buy a car anymore because of the new technology that they are coming up with. This will save people that are in need of a car a lot of money. This new technology would help out alot because of the different ideas that manufacutrers are coming up with.

25850,0,"Advice is important to some people and most of the time they ask more than one person. There are 3 different reasons to why people ask for advice. First some people ask what to do in a situation and pick the best answer. The second reason is that they might need your opinion on something. The last reason is that some people ask for it because it might help get through hard times to make life easier. When people are in a situation they tend to ask other people for advice so they can fix a problem. An example of this is, you ask three of your friends, "" My TV is broken what should i do?"". The first friend says, "" Try to fix it."" Then you ask the second friend and he/she says, "" Call somebody to fix it for you."" then the last friend says, "" I could help you I fixed a TV before."". Now that you have some choices you can pick the best one. If the one you picked that you think is best fails then you can try 2 other choices or ask for more advice. Opinions can be important to people too for example lets say you were going to prom and you had to pick a dress. You walk up to your friends and they help you pick a dress. The first friend tells you, "" I think this purple dress would look good on you. '. The second tells you, "" No i think she should put on a blue dress."". Then the last friend says, "" Maybe red would look good."". After you ask you can try out the dresses to see which one looks better or just keep asking till you fine the one you like. Life is a very hard subject not to many people ask advice for this and its the most important thing people ask. When people ask about life its usually when people are having a hard time For example, Lets say you have been feeling sad lately because you feel like your useless and have no talent. So you ask you family and your mom says, "" Its okay dear you'll find something."". Next you ask your dad and he says,"" Its okay it will just take a while."". and lastly you ask your brother and he says,"" Dont worry ill try to help you find your talent."". As you ask you start to feel better. That type of advice is suppose to help you feel better and help you with life. Thats why people ask for advice from different people. To help them cope with life, for an opinion, and lastly to help them with a situation. Advice can really help people sometimes just be careful with who you ask."

The sport will take up a lot of the students time that they should be working to get there grades up to A's and B's. If you are getting a C then that means that you need to work on those classes to get at least a B that way you have some lean way for your grade. if you were to get a bad grade on a test it wouldn't bring your grade down to a D or an F. There should also be some lean way on the sports side to if you have a grade B average and your average drops to a C then they should give you some time to bring your grade back up with out completely kicking the kid out of the sport or activity. The coaches or teachers will also need to under stand that if they need to miss a practice because the student needs to get some homework done or they have an appointment then the student should be excused from that practice, but that doesn't mean they can use that excuse every time they just don't want to go.

4215,0,"In various educational systems across the country, students are required to complete summer projects that help them retain infromation they would have most likely forgotten if not for these projects. Not only this but it is an efficient way introduce new concepts students will likely see in the forecoming school year. This idea is of sound measure. Students are said to forget a significant amount of material they learned in school in just the few months they are out on break. But how can teachers really maximize their students' fullest potential? What can they do to assure that the students are learning in the most befitting way possible? The answer lies not in them but in their students. As teachers begin to conjure certain summer assignments, they should look to reach out to thier students for advice. Having student-designed summer projects should be used in lue of teacher-designed summer projects because it creates a learning enviroment that is not only efficient but specifically designed to maximize potential. During the summer, the last thing that a student wants on their mind is to complete a summer assignment. And who can blame them? It is most likely not in anyones best interest to want to sit inside a house where work is waiting for them. However, if teachers can somehow make their assignments more interesting and incite active engadgemnt, then students can have the value of imrproving their cerebral capabilities in an enjoyable learning enviroment. There are numerous ways a teacher can get their student's input on a summer assignemnt. They can have a digital survey, one of the most commonly used tools to get basic information on a topic. This is a helpful strategy when just looking to improve the quality of an assignemnt, or get a taste of what might be expected. This strategy, however, is still very teacher oriented and lacks student control. If this is to broad and/or unfufilling, then teachers can avert to another method such as student drafts. This is where a student can individually submit a draft of a summer project by outlining their opinions and suggestions that may benefit all students. Here, a teacher can observe first hand what a student would see most appropriate for a summer assignemnt. This is still a very subjective method of student input; while the goal is to assure that all students are learning during the break, this particular student may not be speaking for everyone else. In other words, a poll may predict the general concensus of a majority but it still can be inaccurate and non-representative. Another, more objective strategy a teacher can use is what is called a class concensus. Here, the class (or any student body) organizes thier ideas together, to come to a final or multiple conclusions. This is not the most practical way but it is non-biased and very effective in a factor analysis situtation. This method is the most effective way to implement a student-designed summer project in the absence of bias and non-representation. Teacher-designed summer projects can be counterintutive, as they fail to not only improve the compulsive tendencies prominent in these projects, but also lack incentives to promote active engadgment. In other words, the only way a student can activley learn is to provide a setting where they want to learn. To reinforce a point made earlier, it is summer time. No student will bow down and work for the sake of working; they need to be molded and guided into a mindset where they can put time aside to want to engadge in a summer assignemnt. While a student-designed summer project is the most effective way to assure continuous learning throughout the summer, it is ultimatley the teacher's job to be the enforcer, the head hunter. Students can be heavily influenced by the actions and tendencies of thier teachers. By what they do, what they say, how they talk to people, and so on and so forth. There is no absolute way to teach and in fact there is no absolute way to do anything. This very fact alone demonstrates the importance of teachers' ability to shape thier students into fine men and women through their methodology. Just as it is important to base educational strategies on the strengths of the students in the classroom, it is equally important to have that same impact outside of school through summer assignemnts and projects."
15935,0,"Dear Principal, Changing school policy so students with c grades that need b grades are not able to play a school sport is a bad idea. Some kids may have a problem with math or science or social studies or English that doesn't mean you shouldn't stop them from sports. Its a good way of exercise and they could go on to be great players. They are atleast trying their hardest to get their work done and get the highest grade they can get but it can be hard for them. If a student is smart and you know it and they aren't try to the best of their abilities i could se why you would do that. I myself am like that, but atleast a c is passing and you would like to see someone succeed wouldn't you? I know i would that would make me very happy. A sport to me is like my life my life revolves around sports and exercise with friends. I'm not always available out of school so i use the school activities and sports to hang out with my friends and stay active. If you take sports away from a kid who is very fit but doesn't do good in school they could become slackers and give up in live and not be as fit as they were before. So i'm here speaking for all my friends and me we would like for you to reconsider what you are thinking you could regret it someday in your life. Plus students could stop trying in school or drop out. So just reconsider your thoughts. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME"
14442,0,"What I think about community service is that you can spend the time helping your state be a better place. I like community service because I like to take care of my community and help other people when they need helping. One way I would like to help in is doing chores for my mom and dad. I like to help them wash the dishes and get lunch ready for us to eat. In my community, I see a lot of trash on the ground and what I would do about it is pick up a trash can and go around and pick up all the trash in my community. I would also like to cut grass for peoples yards. At my house I always cut the grass in the front yard and in the back yard. Sometimes I take the trash out for my family members. I always love to recycle things like plastic bottles and paper. By doing this, we can save a lot of trees. I love taking care of our community because its fun, easy, and helpful for our state. That's why I think students should be helping community."
7130,0,"In this day and age of society, most students that attend middle or high school revolve around electronics. This is something that I think should change because some students prioritize using electronics over socializing with other classmates or friends. I agree with my principal, and I think that a student must participate in one or more extracurricular activity. Participating in one or more after school activity in my opinion is a great way to socialize with new people, and make some new friends. Playing sports for example builds you as a team player, and helps you have a stronger connection with your team mates. I am currently training for freshman football at Generic_School for next year. Some of my friends and I go to Generic_School and work out in the weight room together, giving us a feeling of support from one another. During training, we are listening to music while we help each other out with the workouts we are supposed to do. While at workouts, we also get to know some of the JV and Varsity players who attend Generic_School currently. Doing football was a great Idea because of the strong bond I now have with my friends and the current high school players. When we have away games, we all take the bus to go to the other schools, and on the bus, we all talk and prepare our selves for those games. If you don't participate in a sport, general activities are great to socialize in too. Last year, I chose an activity which was out of my comfort zone, tennis. In tennis, I was in a group of about 7 or 8 other kids who I didn't know at all. But when I get showing up to the practices, and I kept making an effort to befriend the other kids, it ended up working out for the better. I got to make new friends and become good at the sport. Participating in an extracurricular activity is also a great way to have fun. Even if the activity you want to participate in isn't a sport, you can always have some fun in an activity that interests you. Having fun for just an hour or so usually brings anyone's day up to a better mood. I participated in the yearbook committee in 6th grade at Generic_School and it was a great experience. I would have so much fun hanging out with all my friends while we were designing the yearbook and taking pictures for it. Now, even though the yearbook committee wasn't my first choice for my extracurricular activity, it was still really fun in the long run. I also played recreational league soccer in 5th and 6th grade. At the start of every season, our teams would switch players meaning I would have new teammates every time. This was a great way to have fun with different people and cooperate with them as a group. After every one of those activities, I would leave with a smile on my face, and just being there for that one hour made my whole day better. Extracurricular activities can also teach you a lot of new things. Yes, doing an extracurricular activity is fun and all, but you end up learning a lot. In the yearbook committee, I learned how to upload pictures onto a document, how to format the pages to have rows of pictures, and to decorate the pages with cool designs. In football, I learn the different types of positions to play, the different playing styles of other players, the different positions to play, and I also learn how to train properly to play the best I can possibly play. In soccer, I also learned different techniques on how to be the best player I can be. Some activities teach you more than let you have fun, but if you like the subject it is on, than it, again, is a great thing to do. I think learning while you are also having fun is one of the best things in life because it is always good to learn, but it also depends on how you are being taught. In conclusion, doing an extracurricular activity benefits you more than anyone else. They teach you good things, you have fun while participating, and you get to socialize with your friends and potentially make new ones. This is why I agree with the principal, and I think we should do at least one."
17041,0,"Google has always been there for us when we need a fantastic search engine or when we need to figure out what special holiday it is, but little did we know about there lastest invention! Google has been seeking for a better technological future since 2009 with there latest peice; the smart vehicle. Although, this great thought has come to life for the world to visualize, I don't really believe that this invention is as great as the world may see it to be. For a place which is already called ""Lazy America"", why would this nation want to progress the other lands thoughts on that belief? The fact that there are cars being made for the laziest of people who don't have the moments of time or ability to sit and drive to go from one place to another is upsetting. These cars are being made for the people who rather text, eat, (etc.) and drive than pay attention to the road. Google had mentioned that their cars must have ""the human driver..remain alert and be ready to take over.."", but Google is trying to get around that problem so the car is totally self-operated. Not only Google, but many other vehicle companies. For example, in paragraph ten, it states that the ""Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drives themselves by 2020."" What does this prove? Does this show that America's self worth is our inventions? No, I believe that this shows how unbelievably lazy this world has become. Secondly, Although this autopilot car may caught the heart and the eyes of everyone who has heard about this invention, I'm positive that these cars could not be afforable to the people who want them most. Because of the amount of time and money that it took to research how to make these cars, it would cost lots of money to replenish those funds and there is only one way of doing that for those vehicle companies and for Google; selling their cars for higher prices. For this reasoning, many of the lower classes and comfortably living middle classes would not be able to pay for the cars. In paragraph one, it talks about how ""the car he{Sergey Brin} foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis.."" and cars, which is good for our planet and good for the ozone, but if the only people who have these cars are the rich, which is low in numbers of people as a whole, what difference would it make if the many people who cannot afford these smart cars are still giving off these gas fumes and pollution into the air? Many people think about how this will affect the human race and how great of an invention this is. Yes, this invention may have its perks, but it wouldn't make a difference for those who cannot afford the first downpayment of these cars. Lastly, the amount of regulations and laws that have to be overturn would take many, many years for these cars to even be legal to drive in many parts of the world! ""Traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times."" I firmly believe in this. They say this because when a human driver is always operating the vehicle, they are forced to pay attention for the sake of their lives or others. The narrator of this article that ""..special touch sensors makes sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel"" at all times, but even if the human driver is holding on and behind the wheel that does not mean that they are paying attention 100% percent to the road ahead of them, which happens to be a scary thought. Many people fall asleep behind the wheel when the car is fully operated by them alone, so this would not stop many people from falling asleep.. Especially if they don't have to do anything to drive! If those many alert sensors do not alert the sleeping person, that may be trouble. Getting that passed through traffic laws would be difficult; Even for Google! Although Google has been there for us for about a good decade and a half, helping us with our internet needs, that doesn't mean that they need to continue to move forward with something like this. The smart car, may be a pretty new thing to gaze and gauke at, but is it safe for our everyday use? Would it be safe for our newly founded driving teenagers, who already text and drive? Teaching people that it's okay to be lazy and not pay attention to the road is not something I would want to support and I believe that many people should stand behind this thought. I say ""No"" to this contraption."
11842,0,"The use of this technology that allows people and teachers to read the emotional expressions of students in the classroom is valuable. This new technology can be used to detect whether a student understands the lesson or is confused on a subject. Professor Thomas Huang has developed a new way to use technology that can recognize how each person is feeling, based on their facial and emotional expressions. Artist, Leonardo da Vinci, studied human anatomy all his life and used this study to create paintings that can percieve a certain facial expression to convey certain emotions. Leonardo da Vinci's painting, Mona Lisa, was used by the technology Dr. Haung created to determine what exactly she was expressing. In the painting, she seems to be, ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" This was all shown by using the technology many people are trying to get into the classroom to help students and teachers better understand each other. The software broke down each expression she has on her face to figure out how da Vinci wanted her to feel and show through facial emotions. In classrooms, teachers can often tell whether or not a student understands the materials based on there emotions the student gives out in the classroom. Dr. Haung has researched over this concept and has made this software that allows, ""A classroom computer [that] could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This would allow teachers or college professors to better teach students that do not understand the materials, like some students would. The computer's software could also allow teachers to understand if the students are benefitting from the lesson or if they understand the topic being taught to them. There are many different facial muscles that can show a certain emotion based on how you are feeling. The ""frontalis pars lateralis"", which is found above your eye, will raise your eyebrows when you are feeling surpised. The ""orbicularis oris"", which is found all around the mouth, will tighten your lips to show that you have been angered by someone or something. Dr. Haung has been working with Dr. Paul Eckman and his FACS machine (Facial Action Coding System) to better understand what and how facial expressions can be found. The FACS machine is something that can classify six of the major emotions that can be found on your face like,"" happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" These muscle based emotions and the use of the FACS machine can let the teachers in the classroom know, if a certain student is struggling or if one student is excelling in the topic or class in general. Facial muscles, emotions, and new discoveries with technology are all ways to determine if a student is having trouble in the classroom. It is a beneficial way to read emotion expressions of these students and is considered a very valuable discovery of technology. New emotions can be made clear by expression or using the FACS machine."
6383,0,"Should all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity? I personally disagree, even though it is a good idea, some students don't have the time to participate in these activities. Many students already participate in activities outside of school and are usually busy enough with school work and studying. Im sure some students would enjoy this but it is not meant for all students. When kids come home from school they want to have a break, they dont want to go straight back to work, they want to sit down and maybe have a snack. School is already hard enough and they would get overwhelmed with more activities to do. Some kids don't have the time to participate in extracurricular activities because they might already have something planned or they might be trying to do different activities that they actually want to do. If they were forced to participate in these activities it would put on a lot of stress and take away time for them to do something else. Many kids have to go somewhere after school and they might not have any free time to do these activities. A lot of students already participate in extracurricular activities outside of school and it takes up a lot of their time so if they had to take part in the activities again, it would not only take up a lot of time, but the students would have to cope with more things on their to do list, which leads to stress, and less free time to do things with their friends or by them selves. Also if kids had to do these extracurricular activities they would miss out on other things such as homework, or events. They would also miss out on things they have already signed up for and if they don't participate in these activities I'm sure they would get in trouble. Some kids take a break when they get home and some kids go straight to homework. School work and homework take up many hours of your day, and if we participated in these activities it would add to our to do list. Many kids like to study for hours and put all their effort into school, so I imagine they would be exhausted at the end of the day. If we were forced to participate in the extracurricular activities it could take away time from our sleep, when someone doesn't get as much sleep as they usually do they don't work as hard the next day and they would not be in a good mood the next day. These extracurricular activities could be fun and they would be good on a resume, but they aren't meant for everyone. They would take up to much time with all the school work and activities everyone already has, and some kids don't want to do them because they would feel overwhelmed with everything they already have to do. Also if they participated in these extracurricular activities they would miss out on things. That is why I personally disagree with this idea."
21721,0,"Dear Principal, I understand that you may not like cell-phones being used in our school but the only problem with them is that they are a distraction to the learning process. As long as we do not use them during class time but only during free time such as free periods or lunch then I don't think that they are a problem. My first reason is that almost everybody does some sort of after school activity whether they are sports or clubs or anything else. These things are constantly getting canceled and rescheduled. Students need to inform there parents if they have practice and what time their parents need to pick them up at. For example I planned on staying after school to watch the school basketball game. On the announcements I was informed that this was cancelled. My mother was coming right from work to pick me up. I had to inform her at lunch or she would have left work early and have been waiting for me. During lunch I informed her with my cell-phone and the problem was resolved but if you do not allow us to use our cell-phones then this could turn into a real issue. My second reason is that cell-phones are bad because they are a distraction. If we are only using them when we are not learning then how can they be a distraction. At home sometimes I text when i am doing my homework and this really distracts me and I can't get my homework done so I stopped. During class I totally agree that cell-phones are nothing but a nuisance to teachers so they should be turned off so students can learn. When we are not learning then cell-phones aren't always bad because we are having fun, getting something accomplished even if it is the littlest thing and there is no way they can distract us if we are not doing anything anyway. People have some pretty stupid stereotypes for why cell-phones bad but most of these aren't even true. For example when someone says ""Cell Phones are a waste of time"", they are wrong because you might be asking a friend what the homework was or you may be planning a trip to Brazil to learn about the creatures in the rainforest. I am begging you not to completely ban cell-phones because this will cause an uproar of people banging on your door because you banned cell-phones without any hard evidence. If you go out and take a survey of all the students and they say ban cell-phones then I will be okay, but I am positive that what the student body at are school wants is to continue to use cell phones during class time because it is not disrupting the learning process."
21516,0,"My Opinion My opinion is that student's shouldn't be allowed to have phones in school because it disrupts the learning process of other people. A lot of kids have phones because their parent's want to know if they are okay and safe but if they are in school they will be safe because it's the school's responsibility and that's why they have camera's and security guards, and if their not in school the school calls the parent's to ask why their son or daughter didn't go to school, and the parent's will know if their son or daughter showed up to school or ditched. Also instead of talking on the phone at lunch they can be hanging out with their friends or studying for a test. Sometimes kids forget to turn off their phone and it rings in the middle of the class it disrupts the kids around them. And it stops the teacher from teaching because she has to take the phone away and give the consequences. It is disturbing because everyone stops learning because a kid forgot to turn of his phone. School is made to learn not to talk at lunch and text during class. It also stop the learning process of themselves because they are more concerned about getting a call at lunch or a text message that they wont pay attention to their studies and when a test comes they won't know what to answer because they weren't paying attention. For example let's say a girl named PROPER_NAME was on too busy on the phone and didn't study for her test the next day, She will copy the person sitting next to her, and what if that person is guessing on all the questions? PROPER_NAME and her neighbor both failed that test. I also think it's unfair because some kids spend all their time studying for a test and a person,who didn't even bother to open their book to study, is going to copy them. I think everyone's opinion count's and noone should be left unheard because one change can make a world difference - Sincerely STUDENT_NAME"
353,0,"Phones and driving This essay is about if drivers should or not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. I strongly feel like drivers shouldn't be able to use their cell phones while operating a vehicle because it can be dangerous for them and everyone else on the road. Using your cellphone can actually be deadly. because cell phones can cause inattention blindness while driving, you are putting yourself and others around you in danger, and placing a ban on cell phone use while driving is proven to be effective. Using your cell phone while driving is very common nowadays. When people use their cell phones while driving it sometimes has a negative effect. Cell phone usage while driving is a common occurrence in today's society. Unfortunately, it often has a negative impact on drivers using phones and those surrounding them. Because of the growing popularity of cellular devices in modern society, the urge for the public to use their phones frequently is severe. When you are using your cell phone while driving, you're doing all three types which are manual, visual, and cognitive. Manual distraction is when you are taking your hands off the wheel for even just a split second. Many deadly accidents are caused by someone bending down to simply pick up their phone that fell on the floor of the car. Many of us don't realize how distracted we are when using our cell phones until we look up from our screens. That's when we notice that we are swerving to one side too much, speeding or slowing down, or that we are very close to the car in front of ours."
835,0,"Phones & Driving essay Why you should be able to use your phone while driving. There are many reasons to use one's phone while driving such as music, calls, and texting of course. If someone is driving through their neighborhood and they notice something suspicious at their neighbor's house on the way home they're going to report it to the police, immediately. But how are they going to do that while driving? By using their phone to contact the authorities. Say a family member was hurt in an accident and you were on your way home. You would be able to find out that they were hurt thanks to your cellphone. You can also use your phone for roadside assistance if your car breaks down. What if the radio in your car happens to go out? You've got your phone to play all the music you may or may not have illegally downloaded. This then gets you through your long drive from point A all the way to point D. what if you can't call someone while you're in the car well then just text them. You're running late to work so you text your boss that you're caught in traffic. Say your wife has gone into labor and you're in an important meeting and her sister text you, she's taking her to the hospital to give birth. How did she inform you she was going into labor texting while driving. These are all valid reasons as to why you should be allowed to use your phone while driving."
9255,0,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" many challenges of studying Venus are presented; however, the author provides many valid reasons as to why researchers should find ways to study this planet. The author describes the similarities of Venus and Earth, provides solutions to living on Venus, and expresses how researching Venus would be an advancement of the human mind. The author supports their claim of Venus being worthy of pursuit despite its dangers, by suggesting that Venus may have once been similar to Earth. The author wrote in paragraph 4, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" By suggesting that Venus could have some answers to Earth's climate, the author provides strong support to their claim. The text also states in paragraph 4, ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" The author goes on to describe how Earth and Venus may have been closely related long ago. It is also mentioned that Venus is one of our nearest options for a planetary visit, which is beneficial considering the how long space travel takes. The author's claim is supported through this evidence of Venus being Earth-like at one point in time. Another way that the author suppprts their claim is by providing some solutions to studying Venus, despite the dangers it possesses. The author writes in paragraph 5, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape."" In paragraph 5, the author continues to explain how the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth, solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not go over the radiation levels on Earth. The solution that the author suggests helps support their claim of Venus being worthy of pursuit by giving direct evidence as to how researchers may go about doing this. Lastly, the author supports his/her claim by explaining how overcoming the challenge of studying Venus, would be beneficial not only to the insight of the planet, but also of human curiosity. The author says, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" The claim is strongly supported through the author's description of how studying Venus could be beneficial to the human mind. Another detail from paragraph 8 is, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" The author supports that studying Venus would be worth overcoming the harsh conditions, as it would expand our views of imagination and innovation. Despite all of the author's reasons for studying Venus, he/she describes how Venus has harsh conditions that must be overcome first. The text states, ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" The author expresses how Venus's conditions are far more extreme than any conditions on Earth. However, the author supports their claim by providing various reasons that support how Venus is worty of pursuit and how researchers may go about overcoming the dangers it possesses. In order to support his/her claim, the author was able to provide at least three strong reasons that show how Venus would be worth studying, even though it presents many dangers. By explaining how Venus may have once been comparable to Earth, providing solutions to current problems, and expressing the benefits of studying Venus, the author is able to strongly support his/her claim with valid evidence."

Even if you don't see those places, you defindely get to see Greece! ""' Seeing the Acropolis in Greese was special.""' I said. '""So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.""' I supported. I also got to see the Panama Canal on my way to China. You also get to care and help animals. You get to feed the animals, water them, and the stalls have to be cleaned. Even if this is not your favorite thing to do, you are still helping animals! Just like you need care, animals also need care, so it is a very kind thing to do. You also get to play games, and have lots of fun! The games I played were baseball, volleyball, table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling. I added in my article that, ""games also help pass time."" That is very true! I loved playing games on board! In conclusion, I got to learn lots of things about people who need help, and also animals. I stated in my article, ""' It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.""' I also ended up leading my family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years. this trip was a great experience."

4281,0,"Have you ever had a poorly designed project? To try and minimize this occurrence, some schools have started to question whether summer projects should be student-designed or teacher-designed. While some may argue that student-designed projects are better because they fit the individual learning style of each student, this factor becomes insignificant when the students don't learn the material they are expected to. With them being teacher-designed, the projects would be more organized, there would be more time left for the students to focus on extracurricular activities and homework, and all course content would be covered. This is ultimately why these summer projects should be teacher-designed. The first reason why summer projects should be teacher-designed is because teachers would be more responsible with designing the project and ensure its organization. Teachers would have a set of requirements regarding amount of information and most would have a rubric to base the project off of. If students were to design these projects, many, if not all, would minimize the work they'd have to do because that's just the nature of high school students. One last important reason as to why the summer projects would be better designed by teachers for their responsibility and organization is that they won't be biased as to how difficult to make the projects. Since the teachers aren't doing these projects themselves like the students are, they will not purposefully skip over content to make it easier for themselves. Because of teachers' position in regard to summer projects, they will be responsible with designing it. Another main point as to why students should not be designing the summer projects is because they have less time for it. Many students participate in extracurricular activities may it be sports, band, theater, or clubs. Each activity requires commitment and time, and with many students spending 2-4 hours after school doing these things, it already leaves them little time for homework, much less designing a whole project. Teachers, on the other hand, have mandatory planning periods built in throughout their day for the sole purpose of outlining lessons, grading papers, or designing projects. Because of students' restricted time throughout the day, they would not design the project as well as if the teacher did. The last reason why teachers are better fit for designing the summer projects rather than students is because teachers will make sure it covers the curriculum in depth. Teachers would have access to county or state requirements for that certain course and would be able to design the projects so that they cover all the information needed. Furthermore, teachers would test students' true knowledge and challenge them rather than just skim over surface facts. Finally, what makes teachers even more qualified for designing the projects is that they have had years of experience (in most cases). To make sure that students continue learning new material over summer break, teachers must be the ones designing the projects because they have taught the material year after year and have a good grasp on concepts. It wouldn't make sense for students to design projects based off material that they have not yet learned because it's very possible that they might skip over crucial information. Having these summer projects be teacher-designed would ensure the coverage of all the course content. In conclusion, teacher-designed summer projects should be the way to go because it would benefit both the teacher and the student. First, it would ensure the organization and content of the project because teachers are more responsible. Second, it would life a weight off the students because they are already pressed for time throughout the day and don't have time to design a project. Lastly, this benefits both parties because the students learn or retain all the material they need to and the teachers can ensure this by making the project themselves."
4345,0,"Being a student in the summer time you aren't going to want to do a summer project. Who would? Schools out your going to want to enjoy your free time. Which is why if you had the opportunity to pick a student-designed project your going to be lazy and do a quick 5 minute project to get it over with. All a teacher wants is to see you succeed. Which is why summer projects should be teacher-designed project. Teachers know what you need to know to be prepared for the next school year and its a easy grade for the new year and it can be turned into your own with your creative, fun ideas. Teachers know better than students in many things. They know the curriculum for the next school year. Which is why they can make the project based off stuff you need to know,so you won't fall behind. It's easy to forget things and having this project will allow you to stay on the same track as your peers. It's important that you have knowledge going into the next grade and a little studying time over the summer. Doing this during the summer can start your school year off with better grades and intentions. A summer project will remind you what you learned and keep you up to date. So, when your back to school your grades are up and you gained more knowledge. Its a sneak peep into what the year will bring you. Even if you don't enjoy projects and school doesn't interest you this project can be turned into your own. You can make the project interesting and still get it done. You can go outside the box and make this fun and easy to do. While still getting the knowledge you need. Even if it's teacher-designed you can figure out ways to make your project different and enjoyable to do and read. Teachers want you to succeed,but you have to put the work in. Everything a teacher does is for you. With that being said a teacher-designed project isn't to take your summer away, but to keep you in track for the next school year. As well as making sure your prepared while having fun doing so and using your creative mind."

Through out the recent years,more than half the populations drive and text which causes them to highly get into an accident. Using cell phones while driving can cause distractions to yourself therefore the accidents may increase rapidly throughout the years. I would prefer doing it when you're driving just because it is safer than driving. Operating a cell phones while driving can lead you to crash and will get you to a penalty for it. The safe way that I would say is to keep your cell phones off when you are driving because you'll get distracted to the cell phones once you pick it up. The increase of the cell phone uses are very high simply to social media. Some say that there is no wrong in the doing of the cell phones use but I think that it causes many accidents and death rates to increase rapidly. The actions that many people take are actually risking their lives over a notifications on the phone and that will go horribly wrong to those whom use cell phones while driving. We have to follow certain laws from accidents and causing them. Everyday,there's at least some of the people such as young adults who text and drive all the time. Risking your life for something that doesn't have greater impact of your life is basically saying that cell phones are more important than paying attention to what the real world has. During the years,many of the populations that causes theses accidents are young teens. Therefore,the death rate goes up throughout the years and some say that it's not the reason why. I feel like so many people look down into their phone then look up and see what's going on. For me driving and using cell phones is not the way to go for your life and for the safety,I would prefer you to always shut down your devices while driving so you don't get too distracted."
21085,0,"Dear Principal, I believe that we should have the right to have our phones at school. Why I think that we should be able to have our phones is because we might have to talk to our parents, and we don't want other people to wonder what happened to you by going down to the office to call your mom saying that you are sick. But I also think that it is a good reason that we can't have phones at school, because we would always be on them, in the hallway and class room. We probably wouldn't get good grades in our classes either, because we would be texting the whole time to our friends. "" And the students parents wouldn't be very happy, because of the bill that they get from their child texting too much during school!"" So i agree with the rules that have been set already, but i also think that you should give us some permission to call are parents without getting our phone taken away. Thanks for taking your time to read my letter! Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME"

7531,0,"What is your favorite memory as a child? It might be playing football, basketball, or running. But obesity can have affects on some people. I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular event because, you can meet new friends, you may learn a very valuable skill that you will use everyday in your life called time management, and If you give it all you got then you may be able to shave off a few pounds. These are the reasons I think that you should participate in at least one extracurricular event. Meeting new friends is one of the special parts about being human. However their are some people that can't do this because they think to themselves ""I dont have anything in common with them."" However their is a solution to hopefully break this invisible wall of silence. A person can try out for the football team or try wrestling. People have a lot in common if you dont judge a book by its cover. Time management is one of the most important parts of our lives. It determines when you go to lunch, when you leave work, or how much time you get to yourself. Learning this skill now can be very helpful in the future. Learning the perfect balance between sports and school may not only affect your social life, but may determine if you pass or fail. After all this may be the most important skill you will ever learn. Obesity affects millions of people each year. A person can be judged by their weight, appearance, and so much more. However we can overcome obesity one pound at a time. Some cases of obesity reports have found that people who are a obese have a lack of energy. If we require a student to play a sport or some form of an extracurricular activity, the student will have more energy or more will to do an activity. Students don't always have the freinds, time management, or body shape they want to have self confidence. A lack of self confidence chould lead to personal problems in the future. But if we require a student to particapate in a extacurricular activity we chould change this. All people, ""that I know,"" want to live a steady life with no worries when they mature and get older. but without self confidence this can be really hard."
4504,0,"Summer projects are normally always dreaded by students and pushed to last second to complete. These assignments are usually given with a rubric and step by step guide on how the project should be completed. So what would happen than if students were given the opportunity to come up with their own project to complete? A student-designed project would open a new creative outlet for kids, have a higher chance of actually being completed, and it would give the teachers a better understanding of what needs to be taught throughout the next school year. Not every student learns the same way, some kids are audible learners, who can learn by just listening, where others need to be hands on and are very visual learners, who need to be able to see what they're learning. It's hard for teachers to be able to work around and create projects that can benefit every individual student. Student-led projects would allow each student to find and use their own strengths and weaknesses and work off of what helps them retain information the most. With very few structured rules, the kids can run with their crazy, out of this world, thinking that fades away as you get older. If anything was to come out of student- designed projects it would be the different approaches to go about learning, to help teachers creating projects in the future. It's very hard for students to be motivated to do something given to them by a higher authority, normally kids are motivated by a single letter grade or by a percentage. There are some kids though that as great as the reward may be, if they arent interested in the topic, then the homework, project, or worksheet won't get done. With the choice for the student to create the project on their own, it's highly likely that it's gonna be something that interest them. If it's something they actually are interested in, the more willing they'll be to actually completing the assignment. Compared to teacher-designed projects, the student created projects have a higher chance of actually being completed. It's not necessarily driven by a letter or a number, but more by a student's want to learn. Student-designed projects help teachers figure out what needs to be taught in the incoming school year. When teachers receive these projects at the end of the summer they can take a look and see what knowledge each child has on the topic at hand and what needs to be taught in the future. It almost saves time and energy for both the children and the teachers, who now can direct their energy to something that is new and or never been taught before. Every school year, for the first month or so, many teachers review lessons and topics that were learned the year before. That wastes a whole month that could have been devoted to teaching a new lesson or topic that may never end up getting taught or rushed through at the end of the year, due to time. Student-designed projects allows repetitive or rushed learning to never be an issue. Overall, student-designed projects have many more advantages than teacher-designed projects. Letting students decide what and how they wanna learn opens a door for a positive learning environment. It helps put the joy back in learning and the educational system as a whole. Student created projects allow for kids to find their identity and learn new things about themselves, it encourages a greater probability in the projects to be finished and to the fullest potential, and it helps both the child and the teacher for the school year ahead. Student-designed projects are perfect for the future of education."
10610,0,"In the artical "" Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" tells about a techonlogy called the Facial Action Coding System, which is a system that tells peoples emotions from a degital screen. When knowing this technology can read faces, may it be possible to read amung students' emotion in a classroom? Facial Action Coding System is a ""3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like a human mucles"". It has to move all of it's muscles in the 3-D computer to determind a facaial a human is making while using the facial gagit. We come across basic emotions like sad,anger, happy, and more that this gagit says can can pick up when scaning peoples faces, through the Facial Action Coding Systems. It even says in phargraph 3 ""Eckman has cassified six basic emotions--- happiness, suprise, angry, disgust, fear, and sadness--- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles"". When Knowing that, i dont think the mushcine could tell the students' emotion in a classroom. I only say that because, the Facial Action System can always make a slight mistake on judging how someone in that classroom feels. Just think, yes people can see others faces and make thier thoughts on what the person maybe feels, but also sometimes their judgment is wrong. I know the acticle tells me, and the other readers ""Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facaial trait that conveys happy, worried, ect Yet Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facaial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions"" (in pharagrah 5). I still say it doesn't matter about the studies someone has done to, or on something, technology can make simple mistakes just like humans. In parapraph two, you can even see the author asking the readers, ""Can we actually ""cauclulate"" emotions---like mathe homwork""? Then goes on with saying, ""And how can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel"". When saying that it just shows that the author, and probly others that have read this acticle isn't sure about this facial computer tool, looks can always be desiving so it hard to even trust technologys judging something simples as someones facial expression. Some people just may think the Facial Action Coding System is a very great idea, and some may not think so. It's just to hard to get a good answer on whomevers feeling it's the right technology to use. This technology could, or couldn't help others determind someones facials in a classroom."
17734,0,"There are many different opinions about the whole ""Driverless Cars"" idea. They're good, they're bad, etc. Why are they so good or bad? Well in my opinion they are a very bad thing. ""Driverless Cars"" are a very bad thing for multiple reasons. First, there's the increased risk of an accident. Sure technology is highly advanced now a days, but that doesn't mean there are zero problems. ""If the technology fails"", there is always a chance that something could go wrong. For example, how many times has your phone crashed or shut down on you? That could very likely happen to your driverless car. I know I wouldn't want a malfunction in my car and not be able to get anywhere, let alone get in an accident because something went wrong in my car. Secondly, it's encouraging our already lazy society to be even lazier. Everywhere you look there's someone being lazy. For example, instead of going outside on a nice day kids will play their video games or they will find an easy way to get something done quickly (shoving stuff under the bed instead of putting it away). All people do now a days is sit on there high tech devices. ""Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver?"" These cars will just be that much more of a reason for people not to do something. ""[T]he dream of calling a driverless cab to take us wherever we desire, [...] has finally begun ot catch up"". As soon as there are ""official"" driverless cars people wont have to worry about ""drunk driving"", speeding, falling asleep, etc. Finally, the financial cost of all of this. Everytime something new comes out it's expencive and ""high class"", but everyone still wants it. If driverless cars become an actual thing then they're going to be high priced. Plus the production of them will be just that much more expensive. The United States already has enough debt to deal with why would we want to put ourselves in even more? Sure people would still buy them, but if the police can't ticket anyone for speeding then we loose money from that. Car accidents are one of the leading causes of injury. If the driverless cars happen to help with less accidents then hospitals would loose major profit from car accident pacients. Of course, if the technology was perfect, the cars could benefit in a lot of ways. As we all know, though, technology isn't perfect. Which is exactly why the ""Driverless Cars"" are a terrible idea for our society. There are too many flaws with the idea of driverless cars. That is why I would not feel safe or comfortable in one."
13116,0,"NASA thinks that it was made by the planet being made because aliens do not exist. You can not just guess at how it was made. This is why NASA thinks you are wrong. Aliens could not have made this because they do not exist, it would take a long time to make anything that scale, and it would take them years to make. Aliens could not have made the face becasue they do not exist. This is why NASA thinks this. Aliens would have to have good construction and excavtion equipment. As you would say, they don't need that stuff they just built it. However, there is no physicaly possible way that they could have made it without the equipment. In order to build they would need this equipment. All together aliens could not have made this because they are not capable and do not exist. Aliens could not have made the face because it would take a long time to make anything that scale. Here is why they could not have done it. They don't have the capablities to make anything like the face on Mars. The people that think otherwise would say that it isn't a natural land form. However, NASA scientist where comparing it to other natural landforms. That is why NASA thinks that it is impossible for the aliens to make anything to that scale. Aliens could not have made the face becasue it would take to long. Here is why NASA is proving facts. This is not possible in any shape, way, or form because it would take over 300 years to do so. You would say that the aliens just bulit it as we bulid buliding today. But, they would have to have constrcution workers working every single day for this to happen and that is why NASA says it is impossible. Together that is why I do not think is is possible. In conclusion, aliens do not exist, do not have cababilatlies to make anything to that scale, and it would take to long that is why aliens could not have made this face. People get their hopes up about things to easily that is why NASA does not think any of this is even near possible. It would be better if NASA told evryone the full truth."
20690,0,"Dear Principal, Out of the two possible policies you are considering I would have to say that i favor the second. The idea of allowing students to use cell phones during free time makes absolute sense. Not allowing the phones during class time is respectable as well, that way the learning isn't affected. During free time, students aren't putting their time into anything anyway. Letting them use their phones will have no affect what so ever or anything important, such as school work. There is really no downside to policy number one. It will make most students very pleased as well. Policy two however, I am against. The idea of no phones what so ever seems harsh and strict. What is the student is having a bad day and can't call a parents for a little help? That could affect how the learn in school, not being able to have outside connections. It would be like the student was in a cage for an entire school day, how would you feel to be locked up in a cage? The student's should be allowed their freedom. There is always a punishment for not following the rules, some will have to be thought of, of course, if the new policy that you choose is not followed. Don't expect everything to run smooth at first, things may always be changed. Try out letting students use the phones during free time, it's just something new. It may lead to a happier environment, and maybe even better grades for students. Young people love freedom and being allowed to do what they want, giving them this freedom could have a tremendous outcome. I am sure that you have many other things to think about, so, with that I give you, thank you and goodbye. Sincerely, A student with a voice."
7121,0,"I agree with the principals decision of every student having an extracurricular activity. Many students might disagree with this decision, because of some students not wanting to have an after school activity. However as being a student myself I have chosen to agree with this decision. When students have an after school activity, the activities that they choose to do can impact them in many ways. There are many reasons on why I believe that a student should participate in at least one after school activity. However, here are three reasons why I hold the opinion of students being required to have an after school activity. Students will become more involved throughout their school community. If a student joins a school sport club they might be able to make some new friends. When students are able to make more friends they will not feel bored in a class if they have a new friend that happens to be in that same class. Students will also be able to know what is happening in other parts of the school, because of making new friends. When students are more involved in their schools community, they won't be confused of what is going on within their surroundings. When students have an after school activity, they might figure out what career they would want to have in the future. For example, if a student chose to serve on the student council. This extracurricular activity can help students to decide whether or not they would in the future run for a government position. If a school has Home EC as an extracurricular then a student might choose to become a baker in the future. Depending on the what your school offers, any activity you decide to join will help you when it comes time for choosing an occupation. In the future students will be able to reflect on the things that they have done in the past. When a student becomes older their kids may ask what they did when they were younger. Which is a reason why students should work on their schools yearbook, because they will be able to show their future children what they did in school. These students will be able to show their children the yearbook that his or her classmates made together. Therefore, being another reason why students should participate in activities because of being able to reflect on the past. As you may now know the many reasons on why I believe that students should have an after school club. Like I said before when a student chooses a certain activity, this activity may hold an impact on their life. Requiring students to have an extracurricular activity encourages students to be more involved. I believe that the principal has made the right decision by enforcing students throughout the school to join a club. In conclusion, I think that requiring students to have an activity will benefit many students."
20995,0,"To Editor, Ah, cell phones, the gate to friends across the world, or across the street. This is a good topic. Many things to say. But first, the topic i choose is none, my response is kinda in-between. Cell phones are great, there's about 87% of all Americans that own one. And 3% of that don't because they broke theirs. And something that effects my response is that im one of the 13% that don't own one. I think that phones should not only be allowed but encouraged. But only for emergencies. We should be able to leve it on vibrate. So incase there's an event that your family got in a car crash you should be able to know. Or if you don't have a ride your not all alone standing there. And another thing, you should not be able to use them on your free time for the fun. Because you'll end up leaving your friends and eventually losing them. Or they just become more distant."
18584,0,"Can you imagine life much less at risk? Well, unforunately there is a new way to prevent danger when it comes to driving on roads or even highways. Companies now are developing new ways in which they can make driving more safe then what it is now. For example, companies are making computer-driving cars. These cars have sensors to prevent any harm or danger when it comes to driving. Firstly, my positon on driverless cars is that are they really safe to the new society? Only, because what if something goes wrong with the car, you are not able to control that but then again you could be blamed for something you had no control over of, the fact that these cars are driverless but your still behind the wheel. It says that the combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel. It's also proven that further improvements in sensors and compuuter hardware and even software to make driving safer are also leading cars that can handle more and more tasks on their own. Driverless cars are not fully 100% ready for the new world only because it lets us know that these cars plan to have driven themselves by 2020, this is related to Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan. In addition, what if the technology fail on its behalf and someone gets injured, who is at fault, the manufacture or the driver? It tells us that automakers are still continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved and thought throughly. This is something to think about because the fact that these cars are not original, they are opperated by computers there isn't a guarntee that these cars are the safetest, because this is a big concern. If something tends to go wrong I strongly believe the driver should take over and opperate the car themselves. Malfunction can occur to the device and instantly turn off or shut down so that's when it is best for the driver to always pay attention and make sure that they are in the right safety care. Last but not least, drivers must stay on task and focused. Manufactures are also considering using cameras to watch the that drivers are remaining focused on the roads. Did you know while the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver? Only for safety reasons through. I highly doubt these companies would want a bad reputation on the line for the driverless cars. In conclusion, I do believe you can imagine life less at risk by the help of these cars. I think that these cars would play a big helping part in modern times as well. We still time to think out the process of these cars and how they would properly function. Only safe car has a human driver in control at all times, they seem to be proven safe."
12107,0,"The face was not created by aliens on mars. The things that make it appear as a face are the shadows and the quality of which the picture was taken. The Face is just a rock formation, the fact that the shadows make it look like a face is simply just a coincidence. If you look at the picture of the Face, you can see the black shadows on the figure, if you were to remove those shadows, it would most likely not look like a face anymore. The passage says ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadowss that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" The passage also says ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving it the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Key word, illusion. The original picture shown in the passage wasn't taken at a very high quality. The passage states ""And so on April 5,1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web servers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" This paragraph clarifies that the low quality original picture, along with the shadows, is what made it appear as a face. The Face is just a rock formation that looks like a face, nothing more than that. All in all, the Face was not made by aliens and it is just a rock formation with a cool looking shadow. Though these alien theories are fun to believe in, the alien theory of this case is false."
7754,0,"I think that students should do at least one extracurricular activity. A extracurricular activity is a great way to kill time. I will tell some advantages to kids, teachers and parents. First I will talk about advantages to the students. First advantage is that the kids can get more exercise and not be just lazy all the time. Another advantage is the kids can meet new people and make new friends. If its something that they like to do it can boost their mood. They might also become better problem solvers. Those are advantages to the students. Second I will talk about the advantages to the teachers. First advantage to teachers is they get to teach about something that they love. They get to know more about the kids and what they like. They could also learn something new themselves if the kids know something that the teachers don't. those are advantages to the teachers that teach extracurricular activities. Last I will talk about advantages to the parents. The parents get to do more things by themselves like running errands and just spend time alone. It is also less time for their kid to annoy them. It could also make them feel good that there kid is doing something other than being lazy. Last it could also teach the parents something new about the extra curricular activity. Those are the advantages for the parents of kids doing the activity. Those are all my reasons why I think kids should do at least one extracurricular activity. My essay also shows that not just the kids have the advantages but the teachers and parents to do."
15073,0,"Dear Principle I think that it is not right to require a B grade average to participate in sports. Not all of the kids are capable of getting a B grade average. Most of the reasons why is mainly because of people struggling in their classes. If this were to go into affect, less people would try out for these sports teams. The only positive thing i see in this idea is that it will make students try harder to get better grades in their classes to have activity status to participate in these activities. Lots of people struggle to get a B or even a C average. In my opinion, I don't think grades should be a requirement to do extra activities. Personally i can get a B average but making that extra pus for it can be quite stressful at times. As i said previously, this is mostly a negative thing to do for the most part.

For Example when you're work or take exam and your family member call you to do something for her. in school they taught you many thing to learn.

The second different between this two classes is that in online class you don't learn lots of thing. but in school classes you learn of thing. This are the similarity between two classes.

10986,0,"I believe that the use of this technology would be valuable to use in a classroom full of students. I believe this because instructors must know what their students emotions are like toward the subject being taught. For example, let's say a students emotion is bored, the taecher would then know what his students emotion is like. The instructor may be able to give a 2 to 5 minute survey to his students based on what he can do to improve his teaching skills. Which would therefor give his students a better environment to work. The prompt explained a somewhat new computer software that could recognize emotions. It explains what the software can do and how it works. 'The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like a human muscle. Movement of one or more muscle is called an ""action unit.""'(D'Alto), this quote talks about how it reads ones face emotion. Which brings us to a students emotion and how its read. This is where it is valuable, 'But if you frown, the next ad will be different. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming counfused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human insstructor.'(D'Alto). This is where it is valuable this software, it will be able to tell an instructor their students emotion toward the subject and how they'll be able to improve/modify the lesson. With this software many instructors would be able to improve on their lessons. Thanks to Prof. Thomas Huang and his colleage many students would be able to focus on their lesson and not be bored again. This is why I believe this technology would be a valuable use in a classroom full of students."
10574,0,"What do you think about this new technology ""Facial Action Coding System""? Do you think it is useful or just throwing more and more money down the drain, why does a computer need to know how we are feeling? It seems cool but do we really know if there is a catch at all, like what if the government is just trying to find another way to watch us? But who knows maybe there are some valuable things to come out of it, like a teacher would be able to see if there students are having a hard time on an online assignment, bored about to fall asleep, or even just having a bit of fun. It shows that they care and higher technology is coming! It is not that weird to think about actually because we can tell when somone is upset so what is the difference does that mean were weird or have something to hide? A computer that knows when you're happy or sad that's awesome! The ""Mona Lisa"" is intended to bring a smile to our face, just imagine what a computer can do, if you smile into the Web cam to an ad you may just see more that may appear on your computer that make you happy or if you find a picture that makes you frown they'll make sure you won't see any similar pictures/ads. The process all begans once the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face, all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. That's not the last thing it also says that according to ""Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion"" it does't only express emotions but also may even help produce them! Are you questioning the whole situation different now? Hopefully because it doesn't sound that bad, maybe it'll be for the better, we just have to give everything a chance."
1786,0,"Attention my fellow citizens, we should limit car usage because limiting car usage will release stress, reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes, and stop smog. First, we should limit car usage because driving a car can be stressful. For example say you just got finished with a hard day of work and it was not the best day, You hop in your car and when you start to drive you look ahead and see a trafic jam. After working all day, getting in a car to wait hours and hours to get home is not peaceful or fun. Another example would be when you're on the road and the people around you are not driving safely. ""When I had a car i was always tense. I'm much happeir this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two.(In geram suburb life goes on, paragraph 3) Not only does the usage of cars cause stress but it also causes greenhouse gas. The use of cars should be limitted because we could drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" (In geram suburb life goes on, paragraph 5) Using a car to get around is nice but isint living on earth better than driving a gas powered vehicle and slowly destroying the earth? ""All of our development since World War II has been on the car, and that will have to change,"" said David Goldberg, an official of Transport for America.(P7) Finally, We should limit the usage of cars because if we do we can stop smog. Smog is pollution that creates clouds all around and it is discusting and horrible for the earth. 'Bejing, China is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.""(Paris bans driving due to smog, Paragraph 14) After intensifying smog, congestion was down 60 percent and thats only after 5 days thats incredible! All in all, we should limit car usage because if we can use cars less than we do, it will ease stress, reduce greenhouse gas, and finally clean the earth. What do you say, use your car less and get some exersize? Thanks for reading my fellow citizens."
18538,0,"Driverless Cars Are Coming? Maybe so driverless cars may sound like an awesome concept, but this can cuase issues in the long run. for example a driver needs to be aware and has to keep his/her eyes on the road ahead. My position on driverless cars my sound interging at first. I feel like the developement can turn out to be the best invention in the history of car manufactures. WIth driverless cars we will not have to worry about so many crashes as we have been having ln the last couple of years. The concept is already invented we just have to make sure it stayes safe and meets all the standereds. Driverless cars can casue a big chaos for some states many arguements will break loose. Sure we will hvae to keep the passenger aware of his/her surroundings at all times by keeping thier hands on the wheel at all times. As stated in paragraph 7. With the technology advancing we coulf have driverless cars on the road by the year 2020. Google has been working on the google car since 2009 it has been 7 years the car has drivin millions of miles without a crash as stated in paragraph 2. That is saying something big. Cars are now becoming more smarter then ever with technology added into them we can now have a car drive by itself up to 25 miles as staetd in paragraph 7 with BMW's Traffic Jam Assistance. Already car manufacturers are having thoughts about haveing cars drive themselfs by the year 2020 with Tesla projeccted to release a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time as stated in paragraph 10. Lawmakers are not to happy with the idea of putting driverless cars on the streets. I understand they are trying to keep pedestrians safe also the passengers. If and injury happens who will take the blame the passener or the manufacturer? I strongly feel if the driver is in the drivers seat and has his/her hands on the wheel then the driver will be taken the blam they also have to be aware at all times. Driverless cars are not so far from becoming a reality we are not so far from seeing driverless cars on the streets or on our own drveway. With technology we can make the roads a safer place with less injuries and less deathes would you not agree?"
15241,0,I think that it is not a very good idea because you may be sick one day and miss a test or assignment and it may drop your grade from a B average to a C average which would not be very fair to that person. What would you think if you were already in sports and then the principal changed the policy and you were kicked out of that sport which may be your favorite or and you may have waited all year for that sport. what would you do if you were kicked out of sports they usually keep you out of trouble and are good influences on your life. They also help you make friends and enhance your concentration. That would be like saying i' m going to take away your coffee because you didn't do your job right. I believe that it would help a little because it would help make your grades better and give you a better understanding of what you have to do but if I could decide to do this or not I probably say no because it would give people excuses to sit at home and do absolutely nothing and play video games all day. If my principal did this I would ask my parents if I could switch schools though they would probably say no it would kind of prove a point and show them that I don't accept it then maybe they will try to do something.
11039,0,"Ok I see where this article is coming from with the FACS technology,but if you think about it,theres some people out there who probably wouldn't want to be read about there emotions. Realy if you think about it what do people gain from this technology. In the article it talks about how you can tell by the look of peoples faces you can tell how that friend is feeling. If a person can tell how someone is feeling just by the way they look then what is the point of this tecnology. Also in the article it gives you a number of steps to do while looking in the mirror in paragraph 7,but all of those steps are thing they people can detect already from other people instead of a the FACS techgnology. Some things are useful in this tecnology,but its just really doesn't show any value on how this can effect other people. This tecnology is really just to show you there emotion,nut in reality ask your self what can you do depending on what ther emotions are showing, for the person who is feeling this way? So in my conclusion this technology to read the emtional exspressions of students in the classroom is not valuable."

What i do to help my community out is usually pick up litter and help people who can't do things for themselves. I am always up for community service. I love to help people out not matter what. I will help any one at anytime. I think every one should help out in the community because it brings us all together into one big family. It also helps to clean up our environment. Everyone has enough time to help perform some type of community service. Even if its just for a half hour. I try to convince my friends also to do community service. Sometimes they do but sometimes they don't. No one is ever to busy to not have time to help out their community. this story is very enjoyable to write about. I think community service is needed to be performed by ever person who lives in that certain community. I do community service to and this is how the story relates to me. I feel very strongly about this topic and what i wrote."

20383,0,"In all honesty, if it were up to me, I would keep the Electoral College. Because imagaine what a catastrophe it would be if we did not have the Electoral College, how would they count the votes. Anybodyvoted on who you wanted to win it go can cheat the number of votes to change the president they are voting for. With the Electoral College you can't do that because, once you voted who you want to win, it get sent out tothe electors. Who from that point on count how many voted for both of them and decide a winner. Now it is possible for somebody to secretly change the names that way but it is a higher stake, or risk to take not having the Electoral College. Also, it is possible for worker of the Electoral College to make a mistake in countung the counting the votes and to cause a big confussion in the votes but that is very highly impossible, if not impossible. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the off-chance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? The Electoral College is a widely regarded as an anachrosim, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruledbydeclaring the candidate who receives the most popular vote the winner. Not only that, but a disputeover the outcome of an Elecotral College voteis possible-it happened in 2000-but it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. Their are five reasons to retain, or keep the Electoral College. First, it's a certainty of outcome, the winner is everybodys president, it swings states, not only does ig work for little states, but for big ones too, and you can avoid run-off elections. So those are my reasons why we should keep the Electoral College, we should not overlook the goods that the Electoral College does to our nation just because of two little bad that can be repaired."
1938,0,"Cars have been around for a while now and have been advancing and changing each year as time has gone on. People have depended on cars to get them from their job, school, practice for a team and even to just get them to a friends house. In the earlier days such as the 1950's to the 1980's most cars were gorgeous works of art and had style and class and each new model looked significantly different from the last. Alot more people now a days preferred those cars over the ones we have now and not just adult men from age 40 or above but also young teens such as myself simply because they are pretty and most of the engines have a much nicer sound to them. As silly as that sounds it's the truth and basically the only reason, but the problem is that those cars burn gas like it's going out of style, they are very heavy compared to modern day cars because most of them were made out of steel, they weren't aerodynamic and besides the fact that they caused a good amount of pollution, they were also very unsafe if you were to get in a car crash. From then until now we've been advancing cars by making them aerodynamic, lighter weight, less gas to power them and they are also much safer. Since cars have been pretty much a constant thing and being bought more and more they are starting to become a problem now. The problem is that cars have been polluting the world for a constant and long rate of time and it needs to be slowed down so that the air we breathe can start to become more pure and fresh again. I'm not saying that it was perfect before cars came along either because it wasn't but it was a heck of alot better then than now. Now cars play a big part in not only pollution but also global warming which needs to stop. A world without cars is impossible, there will always be cars around. Instead a world with a limited amount of car usage, now that's possible. I know I love cars, not all of them of course, like i'm no fan of a hybrid but sports cars and muscle cars catch my eye and I love hearing the roar of a powerful engine and seeing how it all is perfectly pieced together under the hood. I also love the world I live in though and I wouldn't want to pollute it anymore then it already has been but I would never want the world I love to be without the cars that I love either. That's why i'd be willing to stop constantly using cars for transportation and find another way to get to where I need to go. Not only would the world be better without us constantly using cars but so would we. We wouldn't have to worry about reckless drivers and making sure we don't forget to put our seat belt on. Fathers and Mothers wouldn't have to cry at their sons or daughters funeral bacause they were in an accident. The amount of teen deaths by car crashes from driving under the influence would reduce because we wouldn't be driving nearly as much. Even people with COPD or Aesthma would be better off because they'd be breathing cleaner more crisp air rather than what they have to breathe now. I would never want a world without cars because I love cars and I even want to make a career out of my love for them and become an Automotive Technician/Mechanic. I still want what's best for the world I live in though and if that means less driving and more walking, jogging or biking then i'm okay with that. People who say they feel the same way should also take action rather than just saying it would be better they should try to make it better. I will try my best to find other ways of transportation rather than driving and I hope others will too. Those are some of the advantages I can think of about limiting car usage and i'm more than sure there are one hundred more advantages to limiting the usage of cars but that's the best I could think of so I hope I had some good points."
1358,0,"Cars are a major aspect of transportation in the twenty-first century. Having the hottest, newest, model of vehicle is all the craze in todays car-loving society. But new research shows that cars are becoming a leading contributor to the pollution of major cities world wide, and cities all across the globe are doing whatever they can to help prevent the pollution. Eupore has always fancied its luxurious cars, esspecially in upscale communities. But in recent years countries such as Gremany and France have made efforts to reduce the amount of cars on the streets in order to reduce the amount of pollution in the air. A new upscale community in Vauban, Germany has been built competely on the basis of no cars. Seventy percent of the residents of this community do not own cars, and those who do own cars, must keep them outside of the community. Many residents here feel that having no cars gives them a little peace of mind. Heidrun Walter, a resident of Vauban says, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" A major up-side to not owning a car is the relief from stress. Many people have many worries about their cars; whether it will work, the amount of gas in it, the cost of gas, and so on. Getting rid of the problem also gets rid of the worry. Getting rid of cars also allows new opportunities for better city building. Makeing cities and suburbs denser discourages the need for cars and promotes the idea of walking, biking, or skating to a destination. The United States has always loved its cars, but recently many people have taken to the side-walks instead of taking to the streets. Transportation is the second largest source of emissions in America and it seems to be declining. Studyies find that after 2005, many Americans began to stop buysing cars and started to find other ways to go from point A to point B. Many people credit this fact to the recession around 2008. After the down turn, people became more money contious, and the unemployed didn't need to go anywhere anyway. With no cars, Americans can save thousands of dollars a year because of no payments and not having to pay those expensive gas prices! The fewer cars on the street has also had a postivie impact on the enviornment. Less greenhouse gases has made the air in the suburbs and some cities much cleaner. Technology has also made a huge impact on our commute. People connected with friends and family without even having to drive and visit them, and teleconfernces across countries and continents have reduced the need to drive or fly places to do buisness. Many mojor car producig companies have also rebranded themselves in order to make personal transportation a thing of the past and make mass public transportation a obtainable goal. Smog is a big issue, not only in the United States, but also in places such as Erope and Latin America, both of which have started to make efforts on cleaning the air and redcing the amount of cars on the road. In the 1990's Bogota, Colombia started a tradition in which the citizens find alternative ways of trasportation to work and shops one day out of the year, and for three straight years, cars have been banned in the streets on this ""holiday."" Because this event has grown so poular, many people have started to practice life without cars on a daily basis. New parks have formed, hundreds of biking paths have been added throughout the city, and upscale resturants and stores have began to pop up in the city. The car-free lifestyle has definitely effected Bogota, Colombia. Europe has also had a great quarrel with its smog problem in recent years, and Frane has been making an effort to stop the smog problem from getting any bigger. Paris recently put a ban on driving in the city in effort to reduce smog. On Monday, divers with even license plates were asked to find other ways of transportation, and on Tuesday drivers with odd license plates could not drive. The population did not have a very positive reaction, but the congestion of cars in the capital did go down sixty percent on both days, and the efforts worked so well, the city was able to lift the ban after on week. Car culture has been a part of our societ for a long time. However, large strides have been made all across the globe in order to reduce the amount of cars on the road and the amount of pollution in the air. These strides have had many positive impacts on the communities they have served in and continute to make tomorrow a better and cleaner world."
15080,0,"Dear Principal, I completely agree with you on the fact that students should have to earn a B average grade in order to do any extra-curricular activities. I think that this should really be enforced. We shouldn't let anything get in the way of our education, because no one can take that from us. It gives us the skills we need for life, a chance for better opportunities, and it gives us a discipline that we will need as we get older. For one of all reasons, students are here primarily to learn. Without learning, we won't be able to do the activities we do. As a musician, you have to be able to count your music notes to know when to sing or play them at what time. You need math for this. In basketball you have to know when and where is a good time and place to shoot the ball into the hoop. You need science for this. Without our education, it's impossible to do these things. Second, many students who are in activities are expecting to do it professionally when they get older. It's a one in a million chance that you will get drafted out of high school, or become the next famous musician in high school. Even if you do, coaches and talent agents wants the person with the better grades, and most school experience. They want an intelligent person who can take their team or band to the next level. You'll need an education to go to college so you will get a chance to pursue your dreams. You won't get discovered in Community College. So, you will need the best grades you can get to go to the best colleges in the nation, which will open so many opportunities for students. Third, if students are failing, and still attend extra-curricular activities, that shows a lack of discipline that they will need in order to survive in our world. If they think that they can fail a subject, and still have the luxury to take fun activities, then that takes away responsibilities. If they're the best football player in the country, and don't know any math, how are they going to be able to pay for their bills, or do their taxes. They'll rely on others to do it for them, who could possibly steal their money because of the lack of discipline they had in school. Without education, our world is impossible to grow. We rely on mathematicians to advance our world financially. Someone once said, ""Money makes the world spin."", which is a very true statement. Concluding my argument, I think you should enforce the fact that students should earn a B average grade to get into any extra-curricular activity. Sincerely, Student"
3253,0,"Summer projects are something a student always dreads during vacation, maybe your at the pool and you remember that you have to do a research paper for your science class that has to be turned in on the first day of school. So you get ready to work on it but you dont know what to do it on and you get stuck since your supposed to choose the topic and the format your research paper is going to be in. Giving students the opportunity to design there own project is good, but students forget so much during vacations that they have no prior knowldedge or forget how to do certain things. This is why Teacher designed projects during the summer are a better idea then student designed projects. Since students can understandably be too busy enjoying there vacation they can forget how to do certain things or have problems making decisions for there projects. on the other hand if teachers design these projects they can make a rubric on what to include points, topics, and even examples and if any students are confused they can just email the teacher. Ive had experience with a teacher designed project or assignment and it turned out way easier then I thought it would be even when I had difficulties me and my teacher were able to work out a solution so I could finish the project. Summer vacation for students is a time to relax go travel or visit other family members maybe get ready for a summer sport. Most students wont even think about there work until the last month of vacation when this happens thats when students start to panic. Projects can also be hard if a student goes out of country for the summer and doesnt have acess to technology at all times and struggle to create a project that gets high points. Even if students have acess to technology, during large gaps like summer vacation students can tend to forget many things they learned during the school year since they arent really learning anything. Students are more likely to get a better grade on there projects if they are given certain tasks that they have to do to complete there project so that they dont stress out over the work they have to do. In comparison Teacher designed projects can be easier to follow since most teachers will leave specific directions that you have to accomplish. This takes away from the stress of coming up with something yourself and sometimes wasting time looking for the right topics. Teacher projects can vary depending on classes like for instance an English might make you read a book then give a report on it and they give you a series of books that you can choose from. Most Teacher projects have a goal or something they want you to accomplish,so its really clear what they want you to do and how to execute it to get the best grade possible. Reaffirming my statement most teachers will give a rubric or packet to show what you have to do and maybe even examples so you can have a better idea of what they want from you. This method can give students a clear picture of what they need to do and they can plan what work they should complete now and which to do later. Even then students might still be confused so if they really are stuck they can just email the teacher since most teachers will give there email before summer break begins just in case students have questions. I had a experience with my AP government teacher where before the class had even started he had left us a assignment/project to do. He explained that this project was so we could start the year sprinting and fly through the first couple of units so we could get to the important topics about government. I went travelling to visit my family in Canada and didnt start doing the project until there was a month left. everything seemed pretty easy by itself and everything was clear, but I was supposed to print the the documents after I had finished completing them and I didnt have a printer. I was able to email him to see what I could do and he recomended I just answer the documents in paper and to just hand it to him when school started. i was able to have a nice summer and still do the work and when school came by i was able to give him the work. Even though teacher designed projects are a bit easier and straight to the point it doesnt give you much option to be creative or do much else. Student projects can be more fun and give a greater sense of purpose since your choosing what your going to do for your project. This gives room to people who are really passionate and creative about theyre topic and they create amazing things. by putting restrictions and limiting the ammount that these people can do it makes them feel less motivated and makes it seem like they are just doing simple work instead of doing something special. this can hurt them and maybe even make them lose interest in the class that they generally like. In conclusion even though Student projects offer more purpose Teacher designed projects are more simpler and easier to understand so students dont have to stress when they are in vacation. Teachers provide clear directions and can offer help when needed so students can focus on being with there familys and relax. Students can have a rough time doing there projects if they are given vague instructions for doing it and they end up wasting time and not making a good final product. From my experience i was able to complete my work and work through troubles I had with my teacher so I do believe that Summer projects should be Teacher designed."

3630,0,"My name is Generic_Name, I have took the position that the summer projects should be student-designed. Students should be able to designed their own summer projects, because it will allow them to get as creative as they want. For an example, they can use their own pictures, color, and words. The pictures of the students self designed projects is the most important part of the project. It descibes what the person is talking about. It also provides extra details about what the student made their project to be. Pictures can describe what the people based their projects off. The pictures set off the main idea of the student summer project. The color of the student project is a color code. That means the students can use their own color to descibe one part of their project. Students can also use their color to make their summer projects colorful. In other words, color can be use to make students projects creative. The reason for the color is to make the project bigger and persuade the audience to look at it. The wodrs of the student summer project is basically to state the meaning of the project. That means it describes the Pictures, and the color they used in their project. The words are supporting details for their project. The main usage for the words in the project is to support the main idea of the project. The reason for the words is to make the the audience want to read it by supporting what the project is about. In conclusion, I will take the position that Students should be able to designed their own projects for the summer. It is easier for students to create their own projects, because their minds move faster than some teachers. some students have the ability to create fun stories for their projects. I have supported my Position with details and reasons for me choosing this position. I hope you enojoy this Essay have a great day."
18305,0,"Driverless cars are starting to be created, and eventually they will be allowed on the streets everywhere. With that being said, that means that there will be more dangers that pedestrians and drivers have to worry about. If one thing went wrong with a driverless car it could potentially cause an accident and leave people injured and/or dead. Without having a driver that is specifically paying attention to the road, you never know what might happen. At any point in time the car could malfunction and nobody would be there to maintain control. Cars are meant to have a driver, and without a driver nobody knows what may happen. These days, cars that have to have a driver still malfunction and sometimes the driver is not even enough to help keep them from causing an accident. Without a driver this risk would be even larger leaving everyone more concerned about getting into an accident. There should always be someone who is watching the road at all times and if things do start going badly then they are able to fix what is going on. The longer that driverless cars are around the more that they will be available leaving less manual cars out there. This means that cars will become more expensive due to all of the technology that has to go in the cars to make then drive by themselves. More and more people will have to go without a vehicle because they will not be able to find any that can fit into their budget. Driverless vehicles will ruin the chance of some people getting a newer vehicle due to the rising prices. If driverless cars continue to only be allowed to go up to speeds of 25 miles per hour and cannot drive by themselves through workzones and around accidents then there is really no point in having them. Many places, even around small towns/cities, have a speed limit higher than 25 miles per hour. The car would be no use and the driver would have to drive the car themselves. Even if the car could drive through anything and go any speed, the person in the drivers seat would have to remain alert at all times because you never know when the car could malfunction and potentially cause an accident. Even though there are many downfalls of driverless cars, there are also many upsides to them. One of these would be the vibration of the drivers seat in the GM when the vehicle could possibly back into an object. Another thing is the cameras that could watch the person in the drivers seat to make sure that they are watching the road. This would help people stay focused and remain focused while they were in the car. Driverless cars would be very nice, especially for people who have to drive really far or who do not like to drive, but they are not as safe as a real driver. Technology is becoming so advanced that in just a few years driverless cars will be made and seen on the streets. This puts many people in danger and everyone will have to be more carfeul on the road. Some people that are going to own these cars will not put their full attention on the road, and when the car malfunctions or stop then there will be an accident. These cars will cost a lot more money that many people do not have, leaving them without a car. If driverless cars do become the future there needs to be many laws and requirements made about the car and the person who owns the car."
4338,0,"Although some say that the students should complete summer projects because some of them want to learn more and to prepare for a good future, actually the students should not complete summer projects because some of them want to have vacations, relax their mind and out to visit their families. The first reason that the students should not complete summer projects is because some of them want to have vacation and they want to have a break in the summer. They get tired because they go to school everyday/every week in the morning and their body need to relax, need a break because some of them work in the night and they arrive to their home very night like around 12:00am and they sleep a little bit. So that's why some of them get tired to school, some of them does not want to do anything in the school because they are tired and they don't have enough energy in their body. However, they need to have vacations in the summer, sleep more and get more energy. The second reason that the students should not complete summer projects is because they need to relax their mind, they need to forget everything about homework, about school and relax their mind because if they don't relax their mind they would be worried about every homework and they don't relax their mind. Also, some student could get in a big deppression by worrying about everything in school, more if they are working in the afternoon, they could die. So, they need to relax their mind and forget about everything in school. The third reason that the students should not complete summer projects is because some of them want to out with their families, friends or to visit their families that are far away. Some of them wants to travel to another country or place and that is the only opportunity that they can go in the summer, some of their families are far away and they want to visit them because maybe they don't see them a long time ago, and they need to travel to another place to relax and have vacations. Visit their friends or out with them because the majority of students want to out with their families or friend like a group and have fun with them. The conclusion is that every body/ every student need to have vacation in the summer and not go to school because they need to relax their mind and get more energy for their body, they need to have a break and out with other people to another place or country and have a lot of fun."

There are parites and each candidate running for president in your state had his or her own grop of electors. Thats usually based on the candidate's political party. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. In order for the president to be elected they must have a majority of 270 electoral votes. In the electoral college system, voters vote not only for the president, but for a slate of electors. The argument against the electoral college is what they call the disaster factor. Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee however, it is possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic reasons. The first reason is the certainty of outcome. The outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible. It is also less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. For example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote comprared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney. To add onto the five reasons we have the second reason that states Everyones President. The electoral college requires a president candidate to have trans-regional appeal. The residents of the other regions are likely to fell disenfranchised. They would feel this way because there votes wouldnt count. Our third reason we have Swing states these ones are likely to be most thoughtful. For our forth and fith we have big states and aviod run off elections. To wrap this up i think electoral voting is a much better way of finding out who the president should be. When you do popular voting it doesnt give you a good idea of what the people think."
14909,0,"1/24/11 Dear Principal of SCHOOL_NAME, You know you have heard what kids have been saying right, about if we should be required to do community service or not? Well I have friends that support both sides of the issue, and they are constantly bickering at one another, and is just want that to stop. So before you read this letter think to yourself, should i make kids do community service? Well after you read this letter, your decision will most likely be yes, i should make kids do community service. As I stated up top, i think you should make us do community service, even if we don't want to. One reason why you should make us do community service is so that we know kind of what we want to be when we grow up. By doing community service, it opens up opportunities, and different choices that we never knew we had. So say someone has their mind set on being a professional athlete, but then gets the urge to be a firefighter? Then he can do community service to see if that urge to be a firefighter was a legitimate idea. Doing community service also builds a person's character. I say this because what if someone was mistreated all of there life, wrong place at the wrong time, you know what I mean. So community service lets those type of people get away from their life, and help other people's, thus resulting in building character, and thus further resulting in a changed person for the rest of their life In conclusion, I am for making kids do community service. I am for this for a few reasons. My first reason for this is to make kids figure out what path they are going to be headed down in life, and maybe even change that path to a better one. Another reason is that community service builds character, and it can also result in the changing of somebody's whole entire life. So after you read this letter, I hope you can see deep down inside your heart that making kids do community service is only a good thing. And I am sick and tired of hearing my friends argue all the time. So if you are going to make a decision, I think almost everyone at are school would hope that you would make a decision sooner rather than later. So i guess also see you at school Mr. Principal. From, STUDENT_NAME"

There may be research going on to find alien life, but so far, NASA hasn't found any. Therefore, it couldn't have been created by aliens. Scientists have credible information that shows people it is just a natural landform. First of all, if NASA thought an alien created the Face they would already be researching it. Afterall, scientists automatically assumed that it was a Martian mesa. They are common for the area that the Face was found in. Why do research if scientists know it is only a mesa? Conspiracy theorists often try to confuse the public by saying that NASA is trying to hide Mars. This is not true, and I know this because even the people from NASA say they wish there was civilization on Mars. If NASA found civilization on Mars, they would announce it because it's exciting. No one has ever seen an alien, so if NASA released pictures they would get loads of publicity. NASA isn't going to let people lose interest in their foundation, therefore they aren't going to lie to people. Next, we have the information that tells us the Face is just a landform. When new pictures of the Face were revealed in 1998, the truth came out. Michael Malin took pictures of Mars that were ten times sharper than the original. The new and improved photos showed everyone that the Face, in fact, was a natural landform. There wasn't any evidence that could tell us it was an alien monument. Of course, people still weren't satisfied. Once again, Michael Malin goes back and takes photos in an even higher resolution. The new resolution helped capture the real size of the Face. After extensively studying the pictures, Jim Garvin states that it ""is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa"". He goes on to say these types of landforms are common on Earth, mainly in the American West. The Face is just a regular landform. In conclusion, that is why the Face is just a natural landform. Almost 30 years of research went by until they came to their conclusion. The Face is only a meer mesa. It was created naturally, and not by aliens. No one can argue with facts!"

The Author also has some good points on what we could do to study venus even though it may be hard to accomplish for the reasearchers. Now venus has a thick atmosphere that is 97 percent carbon and has clouds that are highly corrosive of sulfuric acid. And on the surfuce of venus the temperature averages above 800 degrees. The environment could crush a submarine and liquefy many metals. Venus would be worth studing because it's the most like earth. Now with studying venus we would need a ship that could hover over the plant but it wouldn't give us much insight. Reasearchers cannot take the samples that they need. Reasearchers are working to make innovations to are machines so they can last longer on venus and gain the knowledge of Venus. The need to make are Mechanical parts more resistant to pressure,heat and other forces. So it would be great if we could study Venus it would be worth it even with the dangers. If we can make are systems more reliable in dangerous situations. and we sould be able to explore on eartha nd beyond without worring about the dangers we can face our the doubts we may have we should try to meet the edges of innovation and imagination."
3568,0,"Summer projects should be student-designed because students are busy during the summer and teachers make projects to complicated. One of the reasons why they should student-designed is that students are busy during the summer. Students already go through so much during the school year, whether it be drama with another student, annoying teachers, bullying, and even fights, so when school is over students just want to get away from it all. Most of the time students will go see a parent, or go out of town, so they wonÃÂ´t even have time to do a project. My other reason is that teachers make projects to complicated. Most teachers give projects at least twice a year, and one of the two will always be to complicated to do. Teachers know that students go out of town during the summer, but they will still give you a super complicated project just because youÃÂ´ll have the whole summer to do it. Some people might think that summer projects should be teacher-designed because the project grade might help their grade out, but what if you fail the project? What if you canÃÂ´t finish in time? Both of these could happen, then what will you do? ThereÃÂ´s nothing you can do because itÃÂ´ll be to late for you to say something, but both of those problems can be avoided if you just make summer projects student-designed. So now youÃÂ´ve heard my reasons on why summer projects should be student-designed, and the reasons are that students are busy during the summer and teachers make projects to complicated."
11551,0,"I disagree with this use of technology beacause i think we are relying too much on tech. Today we use so much technology that we are taking a test on a computer that used to be on paper! I worry that if we were to have a nationwide powersurge we'd be sitting ducks. but a couple decades earlier I think we could have been alright. When you are talking with someone you shouldn't rely on tech to tell you how they're feeling, personally I think it's inhumane. I should be able to look at someone and by they're expression (which the computer reads) I myself alone should be able to tell what they are feeling, and if not then you can ask them with your words like a human being would. We aren't robots we don't need to ask siri how are loved ones are feeling. It completely takes away the joys of bonding and in the case of mona lisa, the elegance of mystery. I personally love art and portraits because it's fun to try and figure out what they are thinking and then ask someone else what they think because that person might have a different idea. Using technology would take away peoples idea to different veiw points of the same portrait. I think we should rely on ourselves to figure out what mona lisa is thinking. Personally to me, she looks like a caring guardian kind of woman, maybe a mother or loved one. Going back the text says she was 83% happy, 9%disgusted, 6%fearful, and 2%angry. I say it's 100% up to you. In the case of the students what if the picture is taken when they blink? Or if they sneeze? Jane could be having a really sad day and the picture could be taken at the worng moment and say she was ecstatic. You can rely on tech for these readings you need to read them face to face. Ask them how they are feeling, don't just run up and snap a pic. In conclusion, use your words and ask how someone is feeling!"
14580,0,"Dear TEACHER_NAME, Have you seen our earth? It needs help. That's why i think you should make kids do community service! It will make our earth cleaner. I will tell you a couple reasons why i think kids should do community service! Well to start off, i think kids should do community service is because all kids do when they get home from school is watch television and play video games! But with everyone coming together we could make this place a more efficient place to be upon. I also know some kids wont be happy about this, but when they realize they are working together to help the community they should feel better about themselves. Kids should get out of the house more often and help out with the environment. I hope kids start getting out more to help out our healthy world. In addition, I think there are plenty of things to do outside! A couple examples to do outside would be to pick up trash or tutor someone. If you pick up trash, people might notice and they will stop throwing stuff out of there car window. They also might help pick up trash. If you help someone else they other person will benefit with a better education, that will be needed for a good job later in life, or the kids might be nice to other people since you were nice to them! You might want to do other things that i didn't mention, and that is fine! As long as you make it to were the kids at SCHOOL_NAME do community work, this planet will be looking good in no time! Last but not least, I think it is good to help out. You can get a lot by helping others! If you do sports or something in that category then you could be recognized at the end of the season for volunteering outside of school. This could be useful if you want to do something and you have a good back ground! Getting recognized for helping out is a great way you could be a better person! TEACHER_NAME if you let children help out, it will be great for them! In conclusion, I told you it would be a good thing for the kids so they are not at home watching television and playing video games all day! Then i also told you there are plenty of things to do outside for the environment! Finally i told you it would be good for kids to help out with the outside world, not just in school! I no it'll take time away from school, and we need our education but if you think about it kids may want to help out, some might just be to afraid to say something!"
11711,0,"As a student in high school i think the new Facial Action Coding System should be used. My reason for saying that is teachers could use it for their lesson and see if the kids are getting bored of the lesson or liking it so the teacher could use the new technology to help change the lesson or keep it depending on the students facial expressions using the new technology. For example in paragraph 4 Dr. Huang tells us even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression like not smiling using video imagery. The new emotion- recongnition software tracks these facial movements. The Mona Lisa is just a painting and the new software technology can even tell thats shes 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry. That in my opinion is amazing who would of guested that we could tell how she was fealing through a painting a couple hundred years later. The computer contructs a 3-D model of the face and uses the 44 major muscles in the model must move like a human muscles. Their are six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and by the movement in your muscles they can tell what emotion you are feeling. They tell us in paragraph 7 that our home PC can't handle the complex algorithism used to dicode the Mona Lisa. While looking in the mirror by raising your lips at the corner of your mouth. 2 then quinting your eye slighty to produce wrinkling at the corner of your eye. 3 holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up towards your eyes will describe your emotion being happy. My introduction is that the new technology is a great idea for for teacher or anyone to use on students it can change the way teachers teach and also change the world."
15423,0,"Dear TEACHER_NAME, My name is STUDENT_NAME, and I'm in the 8th grade (also, as you may know, I am one of your Office Aide's for 7th period). I am writing this letter to let you know how I feel about the new policy that you are trying to enforce upon us students. I personally am not in any sports this year, nor was I last year. I do not care very much about them, and many others have called me crazy for that. But, I doubt that there are very many more students that also agree with you're possible policy that ""The Only Way a Student May Participate in Sports or Other Activities Unless They Maintain a B Average"". I agree that that policy should be enforced upon us, because having to maintain a B average might push students harder in doing better in school; like studying more and being more focused, now that their sports are at risk. If I were in any sports, and you made that policy official, I would definitely try to study harder, be more focused, and do better in my classes that I don't do as well as others in. Thank you for taking your time to read my letter. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME"
23974,0,"Do you believe that your child should grow and learn with skills that are needed for everyday life? Attending school is very beneficial, and can prepare you for the working environment that you will have to face in the future. Some may say that online classes can be convenient for a student who has a busy work schedule because they can attend classes on their own time, and won't have to spend most of the hours that are in a day to go to the actual school. I believe that students would not benefit from attending online classes because they wouldn't build social interaction skills, they wouldn't know how to function in a work environment, and they wouldn't have the work motivation to complete their assignments. An important reason that causes online classes to be unbeneficial is the inability to create social interaction skills. When students attend school, they have to communicate with other students and teachers. Therefore, students learn how to correctly interact with others, and build good relationships. However if a student is taking classes online, they wouldn't be obligated to actually communicate with peers in person. Having the ability to talk to others is a very important skill for their working careers in the future. During a career you will be forced to interact with many people such as, co-workers, costumers, and clients. Therefore, attending school is a great way to obtain those skills by talking to other students and their teachers. Furthermore, It is also a great way to build friendships with kids their age. Having friends can change the overall experience to a childhood because it can lead to a life necessity called ""fun"". Life wouldn't be the same if I didn't have people that I could call my friend because learning can be more interesting if you're experiencing it with people you know and trust. Lastly when a student can build relationships with their teachers, not only does it give you an easier learning environment, but it also provides an adult that you can ask questions or talk to. I have good relationships with many of my teachers, therefore allowing me to have a great experience in school. I am able to go to them if I ever need something or if I'm confused about a certain topic. Relationships with teachers can also ""make or break"" your experiences in your classes. When you look up to your teacher, it's more likely for you to want to learn what they are teaching because you have respect for them. Overall, having social interaction skills is very important for a good learning experience, and for everyday life in the future. Another life necessity that a student would not obtain by taking online classes is being able to function in a work environment. Many jobs and careers require you to work under a schedule. This being said, if you are used to working at your own pace and on your own time, you will not be prepared to be in the working environment. Unfortunately, this can lead to the loss of your job and other opportunities because you can be considered unreliable. Furthermore if a student is used to working in a quiet area in their home, they can be at risk of not knowing how to handle busy and loud work environments. This can restrain them from being able to complete any of their work, therefore making them insufficient. When a place of business gets extremely busy, a lot of stress can be put on the employees. Attending school allows a person to be introduced to those types of conditions at an early stage, therefore making you more prepared for them than students who take online classes. Online classes do not prepare you for the real world, which can lead to a rude awakening in the future. Lastly, a lack of work motivation is another important reason to online classes being unbeneficial compared to going to a school. Students can find it hard to get the motivation to complete their assignments. With the flexibility of online classes, students can start getting the idea of pushing school work aside to focus on other things. Unfortunately this mentality can get extremely out of hand, for their grades can start to suffer and their work load can pile up. Many students experience this chain reaction, therefore causing a lot of stress that can lead them to giving up. Having the access to attending a school decreases the ability to start this chain reaction because facing a teacher due to you not completing your work can be intimidating. Furthermore, going to your classes in person also gives you more work motivation because most of time you don't have the option to sit around and do nothing. Your teachers encourage you to ""use your time wisely"" when you are given the opportunity to complete your assignments during class, therefore giving students the extra push to actually do their work. When students are able to work on their own schedule due to taking online classes, it opens the opportunity to be lazy and not complete school work. This leads to students drowning in work because of their lack of work motivation. I think that students would not benefit from attending classes from home because they wouldn't learn the ability to interact with people, they wouldn't do well in a work environment, and they wouldn't have the motivation to complete their work. Students who take online classes are isolated, therefore they are at larger risk to having rough experiences in the future due to not being prepared for the real world. They will not have the skills needed for everyday life, which can lead them to failure. However, attending an actual school gives you these life skills, therefore giving you a better chance of being successful in the career of your choice. You are also given the opportunity to making friends who can last a lifetime, and building relationships with teachers who can guide you in the right direction to being successful in life as well."
11792,0,The Value of Students Emotions I'm going to be talking about the technology that is able to read the emotional expressions on peoples faces. I don't think it's important for them to get that technology in class rooms. I'm going to be listing off ideas on why I think its not important for schools to get this technology. My first topic is going to be about how teachers are really interested in how the students feel about what they are learing. My second topic is going to be about how students usually give there opion on how they feel about there learning. My third topic is going to be about how they could use the money for something else other than that technology. My first topic is teachers don't really care about how students feel about what are learning. What I mean by that is teachers don't care if the students like the topic are they just care about if the students are learning and understanding. Sometimes teachers can tell by students faces if they're liking the topic or not. Sometimes teacher will ask the students if they like the topic or not but they don't really care if they do. So then like what's the point in spending money on something like that. Usually students will give their opion on the topic. I know I give my opion and I know other students to do to. Students don't want their faces to be scanned and told how they are feeling. I know I wouldn't want mine scanned. Everybody knows how they feel at school even teachers know how students feel at school. Sometimes teachers will ask the students how they feel at school and people will tell them the truth. Schools could use the money for something else other than a face scanner. They could use the money for things that need fixed in the school. Like the roof it's been leeking they could fix that. Buy new things for the P.E. classes like balls or rackets. They could use the money to fix the cafetiera or buy new books with the money. They could spend the money on fixing the bathrooms or the lockers things like that is what they could spend there money on. This is why I think they should not buy the scanner. I know it sounds cool and everything but I think it would not be a good idea to buy. It would be very awkward to up to a students face and just scan it during class. People won't like that I know I won't like that. It would also be a waste of time because what if just stopped working you would have to fix it or it stopped working all the time it would take a long time to fix.
4489,0,"Summer projects, one of the most boring things to do during the summer break. Although they can be boring we have to accept the fact that they help with our education by not forgetting important key parts of our education such as the math we are taking. If we let the students make their own summer project it'll just become a disaster. Teachers should be in charge on what the summer project looks like and the structure of the project mostly because they know exactly what is needed of the student to do during the summer for them to be ready for the next year, students would design the the project as if it were the most easiest thing in the world, and although the kids can actually make it interesting and relevant to them they will also make it easier for the students to associate with other students for the answers of the project. One of the major reasons that the teachers should design the projects for the summer is that they know what is expected for the year coming up and gets them ready for what's about to come. This may include some math problems that will help you remember things from the year that just ended so that way the students won't be all sorts of puzzled. In English class you can get kids to read a book so they don't forget their diction by making the students go in depth with their understanding of the book and the symbols presented in the book they are assigned. For example the summer before my 9th grade year when I was ready to begin the IB program at Generic_School. The teacher made us read a book of the few that they let us choose from and they made us go in depth with everything we have to read so that got me ready for the 9th grade year. Everything we did through out my 9th grade year was relatively simple since i already did for the summer. Another major reason that teachers should be the ones designing the summer projects is because students, like most of us in the world, would make it easy because they will be wanting to try to have more time with lets say family, friends, play games, doing something that they love not stuck doing something that will not be any sort of fun except for the few that actually are super studious. From my experience as a high schooler there is multiple people cheat just because they want more time to spend to themselves, so if the students create the project themselves they would make it really easy because of the same reason I said earlier, they want to have more free time. For example when ever my teacher would make us pick whatever section of question we can answer my peers and I would pick the most easiest mostly because we know that we will have more times to goof off, its just a human thing most of us just find the easiest way out for things. Although students may argue that they can actually make the project for interesting and more relevant for them. Yes, that is true, but what is the point of making a project interesting and relevant if i they dont seem to find the motivation to do it so they just end up cheating like some of the kids do. They can also argue that free time is really important, but if it wasn't for the teachers and the work they give we wouldn't know anything including them because they had teachers also so they know whats best for us. and yes free time is important but in reality youre wasting your time just goofing off and losing time that you could be working to be ready for the next school year and you wouldnt be able to forget the things you did during the past school year. In conclusion teachers should be the ones to design the summer project because they know whats best for us for the school year coming up, the students would make everything super easy and they could cheat with a simple wink, and lastly students may argue that they can make it more relevant but in reality they are making the project less time consuming and they will have more free time. Summer projects is a topic that have really good opinions and facts for both sides on students and the teachers but teachers just want you to succeed and they push you to do so even if thats doing 50 problems for math or read a book and go in depth on what you have to read its just teachers want to see us become the next J.K. Rowling or the next Einstein, they just want us to succeed."

The coaches here and teachers are requiring students to have a B average to join any sport or activities. If they can't meet those requirements, they can not participate unless they bring their grades up. The coach for basketball is requiring the students have Honor Roll by the end of the quarter. Students that go to this Junior High School, are meeting the requirements on being back on the school team or in any activity that involves students staying in school or after-school. For instance, the student council kids need to meet the standards on talking in the promotion. If they have anything below a B average, they can't speak in the promotion. If their grade is good, they can promote and talk during the promotion. I think we should change the school policy from C average to B average. That's what I think the School and the School Board should do. That's a wonderful idea and we should do it right now. It's time to make changes around the School. This is the right time to start thinking about it. You should think about it and tell the coaches and teachers when you change your mind."

I lift my leg and shoot and my ball hits the net within second. The crowd cheering my teammates gathered around me. We just won the first championship game for Generic_School. This is commonly known as extracurricular activities that are offered and put together by the schools. We should be able to participate in yearbook staff, team sports or any extracurricular activities. One of the reasons we should have these activities for students is because they can improve social skills. For example if you were running down the court and your teammate on the other side you can communicate to them ""Pass I'm open!"". According to activitesforstudents. org having children and students be on a team can improve many things teamwork abilities,social skills, along with confidence. But some people argue that having these teams and a type of competitiveness which can cause kids to be rude and be unkind to the other teammates who they think is ""not good enough"". A true story from americanantibullysociety. org. about a young boy who was home schooled and very shy. He later came to public school where he sat alone at lunch and didnt talk to anyone. A few months later he joined the yearbook staff. He became very social and everyone wanted to be his friend. He later realized that having these connections at school is a necessity. This really puts in perspective why we should have extracurricular activities. Another reason that we should have this rule is because it can help you become more involved with the school system. An article titled ""Children need extracurricular activities!"" claims that doing these activities can decrease the number of children and teens led into mental problems or social skills. A website called USAschools. com stated that in just the last year the number of kids who arent in activities at school end up being indoors and isolating themselves which could lead to no friends and could lead to larger more severe problems. Having these activities will attract more students to join new schools if they have good sport teams or any of there other interests. Some people argue that school should only be for academics. There wrong because although schools are for learning new concepts in math,science, civics and more doesnt mean students should not have the opportunity to join a yearbook staff or a sports team. on the other hand, maybe we shouldnt have these activities because the schools already put enough money into teaching kids do we need to spend more money on this activities? I think that we should have this rule because these activities help in so many ways not just inside of school but outside to! We should be able to participate in yearbook staff, team sports or any extracurricular activities. So to all you students out there put your xbox controller down and go shoot some baskets or kick a soccer ball."
2582,0,"The advantages of limiting car usage is that many people needs a car for certain reasons and some may not because they would rather walk, take the bus, or may ride their bikes. Having a car may come in handy to some people because they are organize to have summer jobs and have social life around where they can walk and take public transportation or may even car pool with friends. People who do live in cities often take the bus, walk, and cabs if needed to. Not all have cars in big cities because it cost more for gas and some probably can't drive. Since driving is becoming more big in life more teenagers and young adults are driving more often. Living in the suburbs you'll will need to drive because everything isn't close by each other it's more distance so maybe you'll probably have to walk or may ride a bike to get where your trying to go. ""With all these changes people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habbit."" Well because they may feel that having something to do with a car may cost them alot. Not alot of people can afford cars and what the car needs for it to work properly instuff. People who did have a car were always intense because they never knew what can happen with the car. Transportantion for America is a fast growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States. They want people in the community that live in the suburbs to pay more because using a car cost more than living in cities in that when your living in the cities you really wouldn't have that much to do because it's walking distance. If your living on an island you probably wouldn't need a car that much because everything is like near or to close. Having a car on a island isn't really much needed to be honest you would barely use it which would be a waste of money for half of the stuff you may use to get on the car."

You get the thrill of seeing new things and helping those in need. Being a Seagoing Cowboy is a unbelievable opprotunity for anyone! Including me, a small town boy that worked on a farm. When my freind Don Reist invited me to Europe on a cattle-boat I could not help myself, I had to go! When I first go onto the boat I was a little nervous but over time I got more acustomed to the life on the boat. I went to many places including Greece, Europe, China, Crete, and Italy! Life on the boat is mostly fun! But there are some dangers too, I fell off a slippery ladder and I went feet first to the Atlantic. Luckily I got caught in a strip of metal on the side of the ship, but I could not worked because of cracked ribs. Joining the Seagoing Cowboys would satisfy your thirst for adventure. But being in the program also involves hard work, and if you are wanting to help others in need than that work must be done. You have to feed and care to the animals on board, and if you do that then you can also find time to have fun! You can play games like Table-Tennis, fencing, Boxing, baseball, and volleyball! I loved caring to the animals and having fun whilst doing so. I was in the Seagoing Cowboys the most of any one. I made nine trips and I was discharged in 1947. I liked being in the Seagoing Cowboys, it revealed a world of people in need. That awareness stayed with me which led my family to host many international students and exchange visitors for years."
14116,0,"Dear Principal, it would be very beneficial for our school to participate in community service. I see a community were there is no trash in the roads or fields, there are kids helping their elders, and even students wanting to help the community, this can be us. Some of the activities that would easily be assessed are cleaning up trash and caring for the elderly. To begin, picking up trash would be good and easy to participate in because it can almost be treated like a field trip where students will be brought to a designated location where clean up is necessary and the students will clean up the roads and fields to have better land and less global warming because of the littered trash. This form of community service would be easy because it would take less than two hours, so the kids can leave the school and come back in the blink of an eye. Pursuing this further, another easy and good act of community service is looking after and taking care of the elderly. I believe this would be easy but a little more difficult to plan the picking up trash because the students will need to leave and come back from the homes of the elderly at different times so most if not all of the elderly citizens of our community can be helped and cared by the students at SCHOOL_NAME. In a result there would be less fatalities of the elderly by falling because of the students with them to help care for them. In Conclusion, I believe I will soon be able to see the day where our community is safe, where there is no global warming happening, where the streets and fields of our community are free of debris and the elderly are not frightened of getting too old where it is hard to see or walk because they will have children to rely on. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME"
23222,0,"Alone, laying in bed, a bright lap top screen in front of your face, could this idea of distance learning replace a school day? Students would not benefit from distance learning because at home students have more distractions than a school environment and could easily lose focus. To continue, when learning at school, students learn and grow through social interaction with their peers. Having an isolated learning experience at home allows students to miss out out on social cues and friendships. Distractions are something every human sees in their day to day life. At home students have a wide range of distractions from their cell phone to a basketball. This causes them to always have something else they could be doing rather then sitting down and taking an online class. Additionally, with all these distractions students have to have accountability and a sense of urgency to do their school work. If students are constantly pushing off their school work due to distractions then their education will be at risk. Going to school helps students learn how to deal with their peers and adults socially. When going to school with their peers students learn problem solving and team building skills as a group. This prepares them for their future jobs and life in the work force by allowing them to understand how to work together. If a student is alone, in bed, and learning through a video it eliminates team building skills they could be learning in a regular classroom. Some may believe students are better off with distance learning because it eliminates social anxieties and discomfort in the classroom. This is incorrect because in life humans have to be comfortable with being uncomfortable, the only things humans can count on in life is change and discomfort. To continue, students need to be prepared for all types of people and personalities because after school ends and the tests are all over, those people don't go away. If students are not participating in school with their peers because they are more comfortable at home it is teaching them to take the easy way out. In conclusion, students would not benefit from the ability to attend these classes because it would allow them to put their education at risk and miss out on developing social cues. If all students were to take advantage of the distance leaning option, then it could cause this generation to fall behind academically and socially. If students are allowed to take the easy way out with school, what else will they later take for granted?"
25815,0,"""Will you go to prom with me!"" Generic_Name popped the question. ""Let me think about it,"" Generic_Name blurted out the words and ran away. Later that evening Generic_Name called her best friend Generic_Name. Generic_Name belted out, ""Guess what, Generic_Name asked me to go to prom with him!"" Generic_Name's smile dropped down to a frown. Generic_Name paused for a few seconds and then replied,""Generic_Name, you know I've liked Generic_Name for three years, besides he only asked you because he was dared to."" Generic_Name's excited expression faded, ""I guess you're right, I'll decline his offer."" Later that month Generic_Name was getting ready to go to prom solo when she heard a knock on the door. She stared out the window, what she saw was truly unexpected. Generic_Name was standing on her front porch in sweatpants and a sweatshirt, it looked as if the homecoming king was not attending the most important dance of the year. Generic_Name slowly open the door; she was waiting on Generic_Name to say something. ""Why did you say no?""Generic_Name threw up his words as if they had a bitter taste. Generic_Name only said what she could, the truth, ""Generic_Name said you had just asked me because of a dare."" Generic_Name cried out,""Don't listen to Generic_Name, I had been waiting for months to take you to prom and you declined only because you asked for advice from someone who is terribly biased."" Generic_Name felt like she was to blame,""I'm so sorry, I should've asked advice from someone else."" This story may have been fictional, but terrible misunderstandings can happen to anyone if you don't ask for advice from different people. Seeking opinions from many different people is important for decision making because you need to see a problem from different points of view to make the most sensible conclusion and if you ask one biased person they may lead you to the wrong choice for you. Getting advice from more than one person can help you see your problem in many different point of view, therefore multiple opinions will lead you to having a sensible take on your choice. A few months ago my sister and I had a fight, she took my favorite dress and spilled food on it. I was terribly frustrated and confused so I called one of my friends. I asked her advice and she said that I should make my sister pay to get me a new one. The next day I was talking to me mom and I learned that my sister wore the dress on her first date that night, during the date he spilled her spaghetti all over herself. My sister came home crying because she felt worthless. Imagine if I only asked my friend what to do. I would have gotten mad at an already miserable older sister. Asking different people for advice led me to see my problem in a different way. Seeing from a wide point of view will help you make better choices because you know all the parts of the story. If you only ask one person for their advice their opinion may be biased even if they don't mean it to be. If I ask for advice from my sisters about school, I always make sure to get other opinions because my sisters moved here in ninth grade, so their high school experience is way different then mine will probably be. Even if you trust someone they might not know whats best for you because they intertwine what is the right choice for you and what would be the right choice for them. For example, if someone wants to protect you they may lure you towards the safe option instead of the choice best for you. That is why it is so important to ask for multiple peoples advice because that makes your view unbiased. Asking for advise from multiple people is mandatory because if you only ask for advice from one person your view on the issue will be biased and incomplete. Making important decisions is hard, but asking for multiple opinions makes it that much easier."

I will give you some reasons why you shouldn't drive with phones. Fatal injury or death is one reason. You are in a big metal vehicle in which case, can crash. When crashed, multiple things could happen to you. Burning, crushed, stabbed is few of the things that can injure, or kill you. Your not affecting youself, but affecting people who probably got hit while you crashed. You might have or had killed them. Another is jail time or bieng sued. If you had hit a person, another car, or property damage, you can get arrested for that. The fine cost could go up to 500,000$ and a jail time for a minimum of 2 years. Lastly, is hurting your family and friends. Say you're a father and your wife calls you. You have your best friend in the next seat and your kid in the back. Out of nowhere, a truck comes and you t-bone into the truck. Your kid has a brokin rib and your best friend is dead. Do you really want that to happen?

Some girls get prengnant at the same time they are trying to get any diploma or any career done. They give birth and have to stay home taking care of the baby. Thanks to the opportunities that these schools offer online, They can complete from home what they need to complete without going to school.

13034,0,"Many people think that the face on mars is a monument created by aliens, but these people are mistaken. Scientists have many sources of evidence that shows that this face is just a natural landform on Mars. First, after NASA unveiled the image for all to see, the image caption said,"" huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" This tells us that right away NASA never thought it was anything casued by aliens. Also, in paragraph 5, the texts states, ""Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars - evidence that NASA would rather hide."" But when you think about it, this wouldn't make much since. Defenders of the NASA budget wishes there was an ancient civilization on Mars because it would help out their cause for NASA. Next, NASA sent more scientists into space to do more research. When the Scientists got there on April 5, 1998 Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera took a photo ten times sharper than the first Viking photos. Then in the article, it says, "" Thousads of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" This shows us that after they went back into space with newer cameras and better aquipment the Face on Mars was just a natural land form. In conclusion, the Face on Mars wasn't actually a face at all. The article states,"" what the picture is really showing is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.

11810,0,"Facial Action Coding Sytems: Good or Bad? People have bad days at school, whether it is from a home sitaution or just a bad grade. Being upset in school can affect your ability to preform well. This is why it is important for schools to have a Facial Action Coding System. One reason why there should be Facial Action Coding Systems in schools is because it would help recongnize when the students emotion is low, faster so it would not affect their grade. For example, in the passage it says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...then it could modify the lesson."" This proves that if the student can become more engaged then they will do better in school. Another reason why there should be Facial Action Coding Sytems in schools is because it can give more insight into the student's home life. For example, if the student is having family problems you would be able to read it on their face with the coding system more quickly than through a human's eyes. Being sad could affect a student's scores and plummet their grade. Finally, it would be smart and affective to have a Facial Action Coding System in the schools becuase it involves intense algorithims that kids could try and solve and maybe build one themselves. The system would promote science, technology, engineerng and math, which is very important. In the passage it talks about the types of algorithims Dr. Huang uses, ""His new computer software stores similar anatomical inforamtion as electronic code."" The coding Dr. Huang uses can be taught to students in order to further techonlogy in the world. However, having a Facial Action Coding System could be a bad idea because it would not give student's the kind of action and discpline they would have with a human teacher. It is important for student's to build a bond with a teacher and to be able to open up to them. In the case with a Facial Action Coding System in the classroom the student's would not be able to have that bond. In conclusion, it would be very benificial for Facial Action Coding Systems to be put in schools. They could help improve grades and give a better insight into problems a student may possibly be going through. It is very important to be able to read a student's emotion to help them academically. Everybody should push for Facial Action Coding Sytems to be installed in schools."
4059,0,"Summer break is every students dream; three whole months away from school. While students see this time period as a blessing teachers do not agree so much. Three months away from school equates to three whole months of time spent not learning about the core subjects. To combat this loss of learning, teachers provide students with summer projects to take home on work on while they are on their break. These are usually in the form of summer reading projects, but they can also be take home tests designed to keep students thinking about what they have learned in school. Summer projects always seem to have a flawed system of being very rigorous and demanding of students, despite them being on break from school. On top of this, summer projects lack in student cultural connection as teachers are not as kept up in student and teenage culture as they could be. Summer projects are always made by the teachers, however what if they were student-designed? Should these projects be designed by the student body or be given to the hands of the teachers? Summer projects should be designed by students because they will be more related to current student cultures, easier for students to comprehend, and require students to do less rigorous work. To start off, summer projects should be designed by the students because they will relate more to current student culture. student culture changes rapidly, and what is relevant one day can be seen as old news the next day. For as invested as teachers can get in student culture, they most likely won't be able to keep up especially with the increase of technology which provides social media outlets to students. Because teachers can't keep up to well with student culture, they won't be able to provide creative assignments that include student culture which is also the fate of summer projects which are usually mundane and one-dimensional for students. A great example of a mundane summer project is the summer reading project. Students are told to choose one book, read the book, and answer they questions it asks. The books are almost always and old time classic and never relate to students as they have plots that go over the students heads. Having a student-designed summer project will help combat this problem of student culture as they know what books usually contain good content for students to enjoy. After all, they are also students. Keeping students connected with school and learning is an important part of a teachers job, and giving them bland summer reading projects is not a great way of doing so. Having students design a summer project for themselves will easily keep them connected with school. Secondly, summer projects should be designed by students because they will be easier to comprehend. One problem with summer projects is that they can be confusing. They usually contain multiple steps with can contain multiple parts. It's easy to see why teachers do this which is to make sure students are being thorough with their work however it really is not necessary for students. Teachers have the curse of deep knowledge of a subject. Because of this, they often require every piece of information to fully understand a topic. Students don't have that much knowledge of a certain subject and instead understand from just a small frame work. For example, when adults spend money the question every small finance, from tax to coupons. Students, which are children, often go out and spend their money no questions asked. Yes, being aware of where the money goes is important, but that is important to adults who have much more responsibility then kids. The idea here is that having a simple summer project that is easy to understand is more beneficial to students, as they can understand with small frame work. Making confusing summer projects turns into tedious work, which is also another issue with summer projects. Lastly, summer projects should be designed by students because they will be less rigorous work. Having a long summer project is not always beneficial to students as teachers may think. For example, while on summer break I got a summer reading project that asked for 20 quotes from the book that were interesting. When school came back around none of those 20 quotes were ever used in any lesson plan for the day. the quotes were just rigor work designed to keep students busy during the summer. Having a student-designed project will have students doing less work, while still keeping them interested in the project. Students can easily identify what is filler work and instead make work that will be used in some way by the teacher. Using the work that the students do over break and incorporating it into a lesson plan is a great way of teaching the students important concepts that they should always have memorized. To sum up, having students design summer projects is a great idea because they'll be more related to student culture, be easier to understand by the students themselves, and require students to do less filler work. Of course, teachers and parents would say that having students design the project themelves is a bad idea as students will just make the project too easy, however the whole project development will be overseen by teachers and adults to make sure the projects are fair. That being said, schools should really give a chance to let students design their own summer projects. Teachers in general are not as connected to student body as the students themselves are. Giving students this chance to develop their own summer projects is a stellar idea and could put forth a lot of great projects with very creative outcomes."
13418,0,"Is the face on Mars the face of a new discovery in our universe? When a face was discovered on Mars, the idea of it was quite controversial. Generally speaking, the face on Mars was just a pop icon, not a sign of life. The face on Mars was proven to be a simple landform because NASA had photographed it from several angles showing all there was needed to determine, there were no signs of any civilization, and the environment was suitable to form buttes or mesas. The Face on Mars was just a pop icon and a skeptic's thought, not a sign of martian life or civilization. First of all, in 1998 when the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia to find evidence, when all they found was a natural landform. The Red Planet was very cloudy that time of year, and theorists believed that the haze was hiding any martian evidence or civilization. However, it is not easy to target Cydonia, because of Mars' natural orbit and the fog and haze Mars receives every so often. So, in 2001, NASA sent the Surveyor back up to Mars to take pictures and investigate. When the photos were taken, the photos were discerned three times bigger than the pixel size, and no signs of civilization appeared. ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" Jim Garvin, the chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program states. Each pixel in the image taken was around 2 meters, when the Viking image taken in 1976 had fourty-three meters per pixel. In 1976, the theories could have been believable, considering that the images taken did not show very much evidence if any. Finally, the American West was compared to Mars when the ""Face"" was labeled as a butte or a mesa. The American West is sultry, gusty, and somewhat similar to what the environment on Mars is. This environment is the perfect environment to form buttes, due to erosion in the soil and the wind pushing the soil around. The landmass on Mars is not exactly a butte, however. This landmass is the Martian equivalent to what the American West has. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars,"" says Garvin. ""There hasn't been enough evidence of the Face on Mars to prove it's only a landmass!"" There has been several images taken of the Face to prove it is a formation. However, the image taken in 2001 is the most accurate, considering that the pixels are about two meters by two meters. That is about 22 times more accurate than the picture taken in 1976, showing about fourty-three meters each pixel of Cydonia. If there were any evidence to show up on the Face, it would be shown in the 2001 image. The Face on Mars is only a martian mesa, not a pop icon or a civilization. It is an extraterrestrial butte because NASA had photographed it from several angles showing all there was needed to prove, there were no signs of any civilization when images were taken, and the environment was suitable to form buttes or mesas. All in all, the Face on Mars wasn't a sign of out-of-this-world autotrophs, but it was just a simple bizarre-shaped butte. The Face on Mars was not only a controversy, but a resolved conflict between conspirors and Cydonia-scholars."
13201,0,"Not A Face The Face on Mars is just a natural landform, although some people believe that the Face is bona fide edvidence of life on mars I can insure you its not. I can give three good reasons why I am insisting that this sculpture is just a rock. First of all we had a better camera when we went back to investigate. Second of all we double cheaked our reasch. And third of all both results proved that it indeed was just a landform, much like Americas. In 1998 we send a special team called the MOC to investigate the Face. The MOC team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original photos back in 1976. These photos came back stating that it was a natural land form. But not everyone was satisfied. At that time the MOC had took the photo it was winter in April '98 on the planet- a cloudy time of the year on mars. The camera might have been fogged. Two prove ower statement in 2001 we sent the MOC to take a second photo of the Face this time during the planets summer and with an even better camera. This newer camera had higher definition than the other two. When results came back they, again, stated a natural land mark. As you can see not only did we cheak once but twice both supporting NASA'S claim that ""the Face of Mars"" was just a rock after all."

I think this because there is nothing else to do during those times and you can keep in contact with your friends/ parents. Also you can use it to see if your going to be late. There a good reasons and bad reasons why we should be allowed to have cell phones at school and that is the good reason. I can see why having cell phones is bad to have at school. First of all, people are going to be tempted to text or prank call in the middle of class. This is bad because it disturbs the learning of the person your texting and also you. Then you might not know the answers to the test and fail. That is one bad reason to let cell phones in school. The next bad reason to let cell phones in school is because they can be lost and stolen. If it falls out of a kids pocket, they can loose or break it. Also if some kid gets pick pocketed, they might never get the phone back. That is a bad thing that could happen. The last reason why it is bad is that some kids might text each other answers in class. And they will pass the test. But that does not show what the kid learned. They just cheated and will never know what the answer is later on in life. Although there is more reasons why not to have a cell phone in school, i still think you should be able to. You might not know something important that someone told you. Then you will get in trouble. If you catch someone texting or using their phone in class, you can just take it away so they will stop using their phones. This is why cell phones should be allowed in school. From, STUDENT_NAME"

With the landings not being able to stand longer a few hours. These reasons explain why earth hasn't been sending spaceships to visit venus. Venus's thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide, clounds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid and over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and pressure 90 times greater than Earth its self. These conditions are very extreme and unsuvivable for humans, But with recent soulution the author has supported the trip is worth a try. Venus is the most Earth like planet in the solar system, Venus was proably once covered in rocky sediment and familiar features like valley, craters and moutains. This can be a very big step for science and lead to so many helpful studies. Humans curiosty can lead to many equally intimidating endeavors. NASA has came up with a great idea and a possible soultion to float in a blimp-like vehicle hovering about 30 miles above venus. From this spot the condition won't be easy, but humans can survive though it. Insight is also limited and samples cannot be gathered, but seeking scientists would conduct these challenges working with innovatins that allows tools/machiens to last long enough to contibute to meaningfully to better out knowledge of venus. Some simplified electronics made of silicon caride have tested in venus simulators and have passed to be succesful for three weeks in venus;s extreme conditions. Also they have been with the thought of adding in devices making calculations by using gears and lever that require no eletricity.

418,0,Phone's Well what can I say about phones there are good for some but some use it for the bad. Like example people use it while driving that's bad because they should be looking at the road they shouldn't be on their phone for any reason useless they trying to call 911 for an energy other than that there is there is no reason to be on their phone. Also there are things to hold your phone for you so you won't have to get a ticket and have to pay for it when you can have something to hold your phone for you. When using it for the good you there is no reason to worry about there is always time to use your phone but while driving is never a good time just wait until you get to the place where you are going to there is always time you don't want to lose your life or someone life because you couldn't wait for a few minutes to get to the place you need to be at its always best to wait then to lose a live there is always time for anything but losing your life or someone else life Is not it. There is so many ways to just leave your phone and just drive cause it's never go to leave your site for your phone if you need something pull over and just take a min if not then you could get a ticket cause you was using your phone its never good. Leave your phone there is always time to be on your phone Just wait unit the place you need to be at. Its better to wait its better to save money then to lose money cause you have to pay tickets Its better to wait unit you got time to text don't text in drive cause your can end paying a lot of tickets or get in a car accident and end up paying for the person that you crush then have to lose a point cause you was driving while using your phone you couldn't its always better to wait or get a ticket.

The text states ""Often referred to ss Earth's 'twin,' Venus is the closet planet to earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance to."" The deatil really inetsting. A third grader can be really interested and would like to read more. "" A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus... On the planet's surface, tempatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater thn what we experianceon our own planet."" I usually get lost to half the paragraph by now, but because it's so well written, ijust want to ead more. The authors has really good supporting details. Th reader will know what he would be talking about what he mean. i would think that a lot of student would be interested to study other planets because if thus article is well written."

I would be very careful if I drove one yes, but I do believe the car is capable of what they need and whatthe people need. Yes it will still need human assistnce once in a while during the times of ""...navigating through road work or accidents."" Which will keep the ddriver still in control and not putting others and themselves in danger. As said in the text ""The google car simply announces when the driver should be prepaired to take over."" This may become a problem seeing as most people think that if a car is auto-drive then it needs no human-asscistance and they may just leave it be and let it do it's thing. They decided that to make it easy to tell the driver "" Hey, you should help me drive."" To help with this they put in a vibrating chair to vtell the driver that they should take over. Itis said in the text that some states will welcome these cars once proven safe. This is why I believe they should continue their work. They have things to discover and things to apply to it. They will correct any mistakes and learn what needs to be done. I believe that these cars will one day be perfected and ""driven""."
11560,0,"As a student, has your learning process ever been impeded by your emotional state? Have you ever wished a teacher could read your mind? The article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" is about a new software system called the Facial Action Coding System which can detect emotions based on facial movements. Technology such as the Facial Action Coding Systems can be valuable in reading the emotional expressions of students in a classroom and sensing varying degrees of boredom, confusion, or sadness; this data can then be used to create better fit lessons for the students. To begin, Prof. Thomas Huang and his team have been working to develop ways for robots to better communicate with people. The Facial Action Coding System, which calculates movement of all 44 major muscles on your face, was created. These movements can be used to classify happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. First, in a classtoom setting, this system could be used to detect whether a student is bored with a lesson plan. The lesson plan could then be changed. Next, the Facial Action Coding System could also be used to detect if a student is confused. This data could indicate that a student may need additional help with a lesson or an alternate lesson plan. Lastly, another emotion the Facial ACtion Coding System could help with is sadness. If the system dectects that a student is constantly sad, the school administration can look into this and verify that the student is emotionally stable. For many students, a poor emotional state as well as confusion and boredom, impede their ability to learn in school. In a classroom setting, a Facial Action Coding System would be beneficial to detect a student's current emotion and adjust the lesson plan accordingly."
16620,0,"Dear Mrs. Principal: For students everywhere, the best part of school is trying out for sports. There's a different activity for all kinds of kids. Golf is for the quiet ones while football is for the loud and rowdy students. Most of these students try hard in school to get a C average, lot less a B. Some simply cannot get grades that high while others don't seem to care enough. The reason they come to school is not because they want to do algebra or literature but because they enjoy playing the sport that is afterward. You have to understand that all students on teams can't always afford to get B' s. Not everyone is an Albert Einstein. Most students are happy with a C on a report card because a C is average. There is nothing wrong with that. B' s are harder to come by as you get older because the material you are learning becomes tougher. Some students, however, cannot absorb enough material to get a higher grade. Their mind won't hold anymore information about a subject, and the student only remembers a few things. Other children forget information. They don't do it on purpose, but it does happen. As you know, not everyone is an excellent test taker. As soon as a test is handed out, all of the information needed to take a test flies straight from the mind. Test weigh more then homework or other assignments in a grade book, so if someone were to get a 50% on a test, that would bring any grade down to a C. Now if a student has a C, they can't participate in sports if you pass this new standard. Teenagers nowadays could honestly care less about school. They come for the social time, clubs to take a role in, and sports to participate in. C is average. Anyone can make a C who isn't trying. Kids do that so they can play in sports and still hold themselves as an average student. So, as you can see, raising the standard to a B instead of a C would not help students, but hurt them. The best player on the team could have a C average but not be able to play. This would hurt the team and then you would feel bad because you set them up for failure. It's not easy to get a B average. Very few students can. Mentality space is different for every person. No two people have exactly the same grades. Consider the ones who are horrible test takers. Their grade falls because they forget material and then they can't play sports. Do you really want to crush a kids hopes and dream? Consider this letter as you think about raising something to an impossible standard. From, A worried C student wanting to play sports"
12125,0,"Hi, i'm Isaac, i'm going to be writing about how this face on Mars is a natural landform or if there is life on Mars that made it. The story is about how NASA took a picture of Mars and a face was seen on the planet. NASA doesn't know if the landform was created by life on Mars, or if it is just a natural landform. On my perspective, I think that the face is a natural landform because I dont think that there is any life on Mars. In these next few paragraphs, I'll be talking about how I think that is is a natural landform I think that the face is a natural landform because there is no life on Mars that we have descovered yet. If life was on Mars, we would know by now. The reason why I think it is a natural landform because, nobody live on Mars in order to create the figure. It says in paragraph 9, ""It's not easy to target Cydonia,"" in which he is saying that its not easy to know if it is a natural landform at this point. In all that they're saying, its probably a natural landform. People thought that the face was formed by alieans because they thought that there was life on Mars. though some say that life on Mars does exist, I think that there is no life on Mars. It says in paragraph 7, on April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin took a picture of Mars with his Orbiter Camera, that the face was a natural landform. Everyone who thought it was made by alieans even though it wasn't, was not satisfied. I think they were not satisfied because they have thought since 1976 that it was really formed by alieans. Though people were not satified about how the landform was a natural landform, in all, we new that alieans did not form the face. I would like to know how the landform was formed. we know now that life on Mars doesn't exist."

In the reading Making Mona Lisa Smile by Nick D'Alto, Mona Lisa is mostly happy a little disgusted and a little fearful and a little angry this is about mixed emotions and coming up with a new technology about reading yoiur emotions and calculating them for you to see whos really happy or faking happiness. This is about calculating emotions on a three D computer. First off, Mona Lisa is mostly always happy and she wanted to come up with a way to see if a lot of school students are happy or just faking there happiniss and hiding there real emotions. there is this three D computer that can take calculations on your emotions and tell you if you are truly happy or hiding your real emotions. secendly, theres ba computer that contructs a three-D model of the face and all 44 major muscles in the model must move around like the human muscles. there are six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness the three-D computer can detect all six of these emotions and calculate the emotions and tell you how you really feel. you can tell when someone is truly smiling because there muscles in there face move a serten way and if it is a fake smile your muscles move a different way therefore you can tell if the smile is fake or not. Therefore, yes i think this new technology would work because the three-D model can detect the true feelings you have and calculate it i think you shoukd try this if you ever get a chance."
17467,0,"I am against the idea of the driveless cars. What would be the point of getting a license if your not the one driving the car. It takes the fun out of driving. I am also against the idea because it will make people want to look at their cell phone knowing that the car is driving and not them and it will create a habbit when it is their turn to drive the car. What happens if someone got into a wreck and died? This could change the world as we know it. After these driveless car will be flying cars then everyones own personal rockets and so on. This will also make people lazy by having a car drive itself. What would be the point of even having a car. I understand that it would be fasinating to just be able to sit and look around at stuff on the way to your destination or even just relax. Why not just stop and explore? Why not just have gas stations fill up your gas for you, or even robots do your own homework or chores? I conclusion, I think that creating driveless cars is not a very good idea because it will just make people lazy. It will make them more distracted than being more foccused on the road. They will text more and call more when driving on the road."
18187,0,"Our world is becoming more and more automatic. Everyday things that people use to take an hour to do can now be done by a machine without any labor involved. This can make things easier and seemingly better, until something goes wrong. These ways of doing things automatically have hidden problems that are not good about them, much like the driverless car. Driverless cars are not a good thing because of the extra cost, the complicated maininence, and the possible safety hazards. Cars cost a whole lot as it is, but driverless cars will cost a whole lot more. The radar on the top of these driverless cars cost 200 million dollars to devolope, as stated in the article. That is just more money added to the cost of these cars. That is not even counted the many more electronic softwear that has to go in these cars in order for them to drive themselves. As many people know, electronics are expensive these days, and adding a whole bunch more to these driverless cars will make the price skyrocket, which is why I am opposed to them. When people are driving their own car correctly and how they should, they can see everything around them, and if something were to go wrong, they can manuever however they want to in order to avoid the problem at hand or stop it as soon as possible. Also, there are so many things to take into acount when driving. Such as the sudden moves of people or animals or other cars, and a person can also adapt their driving in certain weather conditions, which was not mentioned about the driverless car in the article. If there was no way that someone could avoid an accident and they had to drive into a ditch in order to get out of harms way, there would not be alot of damage done. These crazy but possible events are the reason that driverless cars are less safe, because would a driverless car be able to do the same thing at a moments notice? It could beep and turn it over to the driver, but the driver is unprepared and unaware of what is happening, because they got so bored since they were not driving that they have not been paying attention. There are so many factors and scenarios that have to be considered when talking about driverless cars, and I think the possible danger of them outweighs the benfits. Like mentioned in the first paragraph, the cost of the extra electronic parts of these cars is more than enough to dislike them, but now emagine if one of these parts were to go out, now your self driving car cannot function properly. Fixing electronic problems are very expensive, as sensors for various vehicles today can cost over one thousand dollars. And we are dealing with more complicated technology than just a single sensor. These electronical problems are the most complicated to fix, and that means that they cost a whole lot more to fix than a normal, easy mechanical problem like a spark plug. That is why these driverless cars are a bad thing, because of the expensive maintenence. Why can't people just sit back and enjoy the ride and the pleasure of driving? If taught correctly, this is the safest bet. The cost of electronics for a self driving car are very expensive, and a human driver that is aware of his surroundings and how those surroundings react when driving is far more safe that a self driving car. The maintenence of the expensive electronics will be a mechanics demise when one of these magic cars come rolling in the shop. Which is why I am against self driving cars because of the extra expence, the risk in safety, and the cost of maintenece."
7672,0,"Let's say you went ot a school where you were forced to play a sport or join a club. You probably wouldn't like it, would you? I don't think it's the best idea to have a policy where every student needs to participate in extracurricular activities. Some reasons are, right after school, most students have things to do, some students may not be interested in participating in an extracurricular, and lastly, it's isn't right to force students to do something that they may not want to do. These are some reasons why it's not the best idea to have a rule where all students must participate in extracurriculars activities. Most of the students that go to Generic_School are very busy after school. They have to go to things like sports, or doctors appointments, or just have plans with their friends. If every student had to participate in a club or sport, students wouldn't be able to or have the time to carry out the plans that they had. You might say that not all sports are right after school, and I'd say that is correct, but, us students would like to have some time to go home ad relax, or hang out with friends, before having to go to whatever sport or activity we have going on outside of school. If we had to participate in extracurriculars, some of us just would not have enough time to go home and relax our brains! It's also possible that students aren't interested in doing anything extra at school at all! If we forced them tp do extracurricular activities here at school, they probably wouldn't enjoy it, so they wouldn't enjoy school as much, then there wouldn't be as mush time and effort into their schoolwork. Then they wouldn't be getting good grades, and everything would just go downhill. It's like a domino effect! Some students aren't interested in joining the student council either. It's very hard being on the student council. You always need to be coming up with new creative ideas, and help put middle school events together. It's a lot of work to do! With schoolwork ans being on the student council, some students might get flustered an may feel like they're drowning in work to do. On the other hand, joining an extracurricular may be fun. It's a great way to make new friends! If you're bored at school, it's something to do! It looks and sounds really fun, but only if you have your schoolwork and projects together. But again, if you're flustered it doesn't sound and probably won't be fun to participate in. In conclusion, It's not right to expect all students to join a club, sport, or student council. Students may not be interested or have the time to participate."
24573,0,"When you are having a hard time making a decision, you often go to your friends or family to give you advice on what to do. When you seek more then one person for advice, you are getting different opinions and different answers to the question you have. It is always a good idea to ask more then one person, because you never know what the person has gone through and what type of advice they will tell you. You may be wondering, what is the point of asking advice if all you are going to get is different answers to your one problem. When you ask more then one person for advice, you are going to get different answers out of all of them because, they may have more experience in life then you, they understand you better, or they just know what you are going through. When asking someone older then you for advice, you may get solutions that you could ever think of. The reason for this is because, they've been alive longer then you. They know how life works and how to find solutions out of nowhere. People older then you often give the best advice or opinion because, they've been your age and know who to get pass what you are trying to get pass. That's why people often say parents give out the best advice. So next time your arguing with your parents just remember that they are probably right, because they've done it themselves already, and they are the people that care about you the most. Some of the best advice you can get is from someone who has been in your shoes and knows how to handle it. This doesn't nessicerly mean that person has to be older then you, your friend could've gone through the same thing that you are going through right now. That is why getting the advice from a friend, that has already done what you are trying to get done, is one of the best. They don't only know what you are going through, they are also around the same age as you. Getting advice from one of your friends that is around your age is probably the best feeling you could get while getting advice because, you know they have been through it and if they can do it, you know you can do it too. You could ask a million people for advice and everyone would give you different advice and opinions. But when you ask the person who has just gone through it, they will not only give some of the best advice, they will also giver you some of the most useful advice. The people that know what you are going through are going to want to help you the most. They will tell you ways that they have gone through the problem, what advice they got, and what and what not works. If you are seeking advice to get out of something like depression, suicide, etc., the people who have been through it themselves know how hard it can get, and they know what type of advice is the most helpful for what you are dealing with. The best thing that you can do when looking for advice is asking multiple people. Whether they are older then you, understand you, or even know what you are going through, they all with give slightly different advice. When asking multiple people you are getting different views of the problem that you are trying to solve. Everyone came up in a different background and have dealt with things of their own. That's why people will give you different advice, because they have been through different things. Getting all these different opinions and advice from so many different people can only make you better and get through the problem even faster. Next time you are looking for advice from someone, make sure that you ask many different people with different backgrounds, so you can make the best decision you can make."

Computer can recognize our facial movements by using express how we feels. The author described basic emotions, by characteristic movements of the facial muscles. The action of muscular indicate between a genuine happy or smile and pretending to be happy. The author support that how much technology can do. First, the FACS new sofeware would be helpful for psychologists doctor. The FACS will help them to tell how their petients are feelings and know what they need to improve in their life. The author indicated that whom are experts at technology, find a better ways to communicate humans and software technology. The expression of our facial can be predict. Next, computer can recognize facial movements how we express our feelings. In the article, the author described movements of our facial muscles called 'action unit"". How the movements of facial muscles work is for example, celebrity is not happy in inside but she/he can pretend to be happy and smile in front of her fans. The musculer movement work is like pretending and force to be smile but not movement of facial muscles only expresses emotions, but can help you to produce them. Finally, in the article the author decribed six basic emotions. The basic emotions are ""happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness"" each of them related to movements of the facial muscles. For example, someone who surround us, we can probably tell how their feels by looking at them. The author explained, movements of facial express are ""all about muscular action units'. According to 'Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion"" can make you actually produce smiling and creating emotions. In conclusion, technology can read emottional expression of humans by the FACS. Muscular action units indicate the difference between a real smile and forced one but making a fake smile can help you to produce them. The new software, Facial Action Coding System identify human emotions by looking at them. The author support, technology can develop humans and computers to communicate better ways. From the article, we can tell that technology can do much more than we think."
23616,0,"Home is where the heart is. Almost everyone is comfortable at their own house, especially if they're still growing up in it. When you are at the place you live you can be yourself, with limited outside noise. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because there would be less distractions and more independence. A lot of people enjoy working alone and believe they get more work done when they are alone. My first reason for why students would benefit from taking classes at home is that there would be less distractions. At my school there are almost two thousand people, which can be overwhelming sometimes. Being able to take classes at your house would allow students to focus on themselves and their work only, increasing how much work they get done and even how efficient the work is. For example, my mom works from home three to four times and she is always saying how nice it is. She enjoys being on her time schedule and believes she actually gets more work done when she is not in the office. Another reason students could benefit from taking classes at home is that it allows more independence. Most people would rather work by themselves than in a group. At school sometimes you are forced to work with other people which can make students uncomfortable, and less productive. So having the opportunity to work alone, in your own house would surely be beneficial to many. An example can be myself, I am more comfortable working by myself than in a group. When in a group you have to rely on other people, by yourself its all on you to complete what is necessary and I enjoy having that independence. Some may say that if this were to happen, students would not get any work done at home. That they would distract themselves with either their phone, the television, or even video games. I can see where they are coming from, but ultimately it is up to the student to do whatever they have to, its their grade and their future. I believe given this opportunity, more than 90% of students would take advantage of it and not allow themselves to get more distracted at home, than at school. In conclusion, I am confident students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, as there would be less distractions and more independence. Distance learning should be an option at many, if not all school districts."
1811,0,"Limiting car usage is very important because, it can save a lot of money. Some places doesn't allow cars because of the space that they have. Such as in Vauban Germany, some people even give up their car. Vauban's streets are completely car free. 70 percent of Vauban's familiies do not own a car, and 57 percent old a car to mov there. In order to stay in that community they could not have a car therefore they had to sell it. Some are even happy without their cars. Having a car can have a lot of stress on some people. Every week you have to worry about gas. Gas now is a lot of money that you hae to spend. Think about it if you didn't have to buy gas every week or every other week you would have a lot of money saved up. The gas you put in your tank could of went to more grocery in the house. Something that is important such as a ""want"". Since World War II people have been depending on a car to get around and that need to change as in today. In the United State the Enbironmental Protection Agency has beem proting "" Car Reduced "" and if they do not then they will play a much lager role in a new six-year federl transportation bill to be approved very soon. Limiting the cars will even be better on the road as well. The congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after just five days of intensifying smog. The gas that the cars release is very dangerious as well, diesel fuel was even blamed since France has a tax policy that favors diesel ober gasoline. In Colombian people as in the city participate in a car-free day every year whichthis is the Thrid year and the city has made a lot of money by doing that. The turn out always be large, despite gray clouds. ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating yet"". It's also a great way to take away stess from people and lower the air pollution. The day without cars had began in Bogota in the mid-1990s. people started using bicycles or walking."
16153,0,"Dear TEACHER_NAME, I believe you are requiring kids to have a B average to play sports in school, and i believe that most students have C averages. I must have to say that I disagree because i believe C grades are in the 70 averages and its still passing and good enough. If it was 65 or lower the grade needs improvement and those people who have 65 and lower should not play because it might cause distraction to themselves and work. A, B, and C averages deserve to play because those grades look good on your report card. An A average is excellent. A B average is great. A C average is good. Anything under 65 needs improvement. That's how i believe its suppose to work in able to play sports on actual teams. I also think that if you are in the 60's, in order to play on a team you have to have great behavior and at least try to pass because maybe you are trying hard enough but you just can't get to the point of A, B, and C averages. It's not fair just for people to have a B average because other people deserve to play and there have to be a limit. I've seen people note get to play and they need to express themselves and if you play good in high school college scouts would see and would like to give you scholarships. I hope you understand my opinion and make a better choice. I rest my case."
13334,0,"Twenty five years ago, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars. While snapping photos of possible landing sites, it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. The head is nearly two miles from end to end and seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. This head formation is just a natural landform on Mars. On the otherhand, some people think that NASA would rather hide the fact that it could be life on Mars, say conspiracy theorists. The face on Mars is a natural land form. The article states that, ""Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet in September 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended."" This shows that pictures would be taken to prove that the landform is indeed a natrual landform. The text also states that, ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the face first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" This peice of text shows proves that with the pictures, the head is a natural landform. These text peices show that the face is a natural landform on Mars. The land formation on Mars is was not created by aliens. The article states that, ""On April 8, 2001-a cloudless summer day in Cydonia-Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. 'We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view, Mailin's team an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" The text also states that, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, so if there were any objects in this picure like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" These text peices show that the pictures would have caught any signs of alien incounters so these prove that the natrual landform on Mars was not created by aliens. Some say that the face has been created by aliens and that it is not a natural landform. The article states that, ""But not everyone was satisfied. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it ws winter in April '98-a cloudy time of year on the Red planet. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze."" These text peices show that since it was a cloudy time, the alien markings weren't revealed which makes them believe that the face was created by aliens. However, new pictures were taken and shows that if there was alien markings, they would have been noticed which goes to show that the face is a natural landform. In conclusion, 25 years ago, a face had been seen on Mars by pictures from the Vinking that is a natural landform and looks similar to a human face. Some say that the landform was created by aliens, but there is proof that aliens had no part in the formation what so ever. Few scientists believe that it's a alien artifact but with pictures, alien markings would have been noticed. The Face on Mars is just a natural landform."
22208,0,"Dear Principal, I believe that you should let teenagers bring their cell phones to school and contact people during their lunch period. You should do this because some teenagers might need their cell phone for after school activities. For instance, RELATIVE_NAME has baseball practice after school and needs to tell his mother that he needs to stay after. RELATIVE_NAME can't call from the office phone because their lines can't use that certain area code. So, in his case he can use his cell phone to call or text his mother and tell her that he has to stay after. I do know that some teenagers will text during class, but that is up to the teachers to be paying attention to their students and not their computer or other activities. As you can see teens might need their cell phone in school for a useful reason, not just to text their friends. You will need to advise teachers will need to pay more attention to their students if you are going to come through with this idea. In the other free times and lunch period is usually the best time to contact people because you will not get in trouble for having a cell phone out. It is hard to hide a cell phone in class, in that case most teens will not try to hide it. Only few students will actually try to succeed; and it is fairly easy to tell when a student is texting. In conclusion you should let teenagers have their cell phone at school but only be allowed to contact people with them in free times. Also because, even if you do say no cell phones allowed at all about 60% will still bring theirs in. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME."
3807,0,"Summer break is meant to give kids a break from school and the constant teacher-chosen workload. Summer projects should be student-designed because they will allow kids to show their creativity. Being forced to create boring and dull projects is very demoralizing and will make a student feel trapped. to contrast, when students can design their own projects it will be more fun and it will let students think for themselves. Additionally, having student-designed projects will boost the amount of kids who complete the projects. To start, student-designed projects should be given to students because they let students creativity shine. Creativity is an important part of every child's life, not being able to use it will make a child dull. For example, when someone does not practice or use something they often lose their ability to do it. Additionally, student-designed projects would let students show who they really are and what they enjoy. When students can show who they really are they feel happy and good about themselves. Also, when they can express what they enjoy they will attract other classmates that enjoy the same thing. Having friends that enjoy the same thing they do will not only improve their happiness but will also improve their work ethic towards what they enjoy. For example, I am in very demanding and somewhat difficult classes. Having friends in the same classes as me with the same goals makes it a lot easier. Without them I would most likely not work nearly as hard. To add, student-designed projects should be given to students because they will increase the amount of kids that will complete the project. When students are forced to complete something they do not enjoy some people just will not do it. If students enjoy the project and look forward to it many more will complete it. For example, I have been assigned many projects during my life. When a teacher gives the students more than one way they can do the project it always has more submissions than if it was only an essay. Specifically, after reading a book, my class had to do a final report. When the teacher gave us options such as a: poster, essay, picture, or model it had many submissions. To contrast, many people would say that having student-designed projects would allow students to not work as hard as they would if they had teacher-designed projects. What they did not consider is that it is summer break and that most students would not be working hard anyways. To add, having student-designed projects would allow the students to be more enthusiastic about the project and work harder. If you expect students to work hard during summer why even have a summer break? It does not make any sense to give students a break that they still need to work during. In conclusion, summer projects should be student-designed because they will allow kids to show their creativity, and they will increase the amount of students who complete them. Giving students something they can choose will ultimately increase students work ethic and view of school."
10809,0,"I think that the Facial Action Coding System used to read the emotion and expressions in students in a classroom is valuable because it can be used for many different things such as potentionaly making people feel better, helps tell when people are not being truthful and can tell when a student becomes confused of bored. First of all, this technology to read the emotions and expressions of a students in a classroom is valuable because, even know sometimes you fake emotions it many still be able to make you feel that way. For example the author stated in paragraph 9 that "" Theory Of Emotion, moving you facial muscles not only expresses emotion, but may be able to produce them."" What this is saying is that the muscles that you use in your face to fake an emotion can actually make you feel that emotion. Secoundly, this technolgy could also help and be valuable not just in a classroom but also outside such as the police department. The reason why is because your facial expressions can make other people tell if you are not being truthful and not telling the truth. The author states this in paragragh 8 saying "" To an expert, faces don't lie: these muscle clues are somtimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" polaticion or celebrity isn't being truthful."" What this is saying is this new technology could help tell when someone is lying about cheating on a test or homework. And this doesnt just go for inside school or classrooms this could go for the police to. To tell if someone isnt being truthful about something and which part they arent being truthful about. Finally, the last thing I have to support for this is could help teacher relize when a student is confused or bored in a classroom. How the author explains this is in paragragh 6. It states that "" A classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" What this means is that how the students facial expressions react to what pops up on the computer can show when the student is interested in what is happening or confuse, and bored. And the author also stated ""Then it could modify the lesson, like and effective human instructor. The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive- for video games or video surgerys"". What this is saying is a computer can tell when you are bored or confused and help to keep you fouced and intertained more by making the lesson more expressive and also making it more interesting for the student. In conclusion, I believe what I have stated above proves that this technolgy can help in many ways such as potentionaly making people feel better, helps tell when people are not being truthful and can tell when a student becomes confused of bored. And that this will help many students and teachers in a classroom."

First I think that SCHOOL_NAME should be a loud to pickup trash from the community. Other childern want to do something fun like plying games,talking with they friends and other thangs they like to do. community service need to be only for voliters or craminals I also think that the craminals will have something to do. even they will be picking up garbith they will be happy to be out of jeil. TO volatier they have to wear old cloths. they have a seartan time for them to be done. if they are bord at home they can ask the people to do more work with the community service. the people will tell them what ever they want. then the volienters will go home or stay there ware they are at. as you can see I tould you two good reasons why all students should not be forced to do community service."
4871,0,"Schools should definitely require students to have some form of summer homework, so they are not completely brain-dead when they return the following year. The argument on whether or not it should be teacher or student designed is a tough one. Nevertheless, students' summer projects should be student-designed, because it makes it more fun, pushes students to be more creative, and is easier for students to complete. Admittedly, some might claim that summer homework should be teacher-designed, because it provides more insightful, specific, instructions rather than each student doing their own thing. These claims are wrong, because if teachers want students to be more involved over summer, giving them the freedom to express themselves however they please is the best way to do so. Students would rather take the time to come up with their own projects than doing some old, outdated assignment like reading a specific book. Firstly, summer projects should be student-designed because they are more fun on the students' behalf. Students would have the freedom to do whatever they want around a certain topic, giving them the means to complete it on their own time, their own way. For example, If the topic was about the book, "" To Kill A Mockingbird "" one could do a podcast, make a short film, write a review, make a pamphlet, or anything they want, regarding this topic. Students would be more dedicated to designing and completing their own work, start to finish. Secondly, summer projects should be student-designed because it pushes students to be more creative. Students are tasked with coming up with one of many types of ideas for the project, versus just doing whatever the teacher assigns. Students must be creative about what kind of project they want to design, how they want to do it, and how it will be different from his or her classmates. Students could also be assigned to compete against one another, which will push them to do their very best work. Students could even use their forte, which is social media, to complete these projects. Furthermore, summer projects should be student-designed because it is easier for students to complete. When projects are teacher-designed, especially over summer, they can be hard to do. These projects sometimes have minimal instructions, and since it is over summer, there is no teacher guidance, just a bland rubric. This is why summer projects should be student-designed. Students also have better ideas for their own projects, which is why they prefer designing their own over a teacher-assigned one. Students will complete their own projects faster, have more fun with them, and even be able to incorporate their friends and classmates however they please. In conclusion, summer projects should be student-designed because it is more fun on the students behalf, promotes creativity, and makes it easier for students to complete. Schools must be more open to these ideas, and also to the fact that students deserve a say in what they do or what they are assigned to. Schools must promote student involvement more, giving them the freedom and room to express themselves, while in a safe environment. Teachers also need to trust their students with being able to design and complete their own projects, which will help mature them and shape them into the adults the future needs."
20176,0,"Since our beautiful country was born we've always used the Electoral College system to elect our presidents. It's time that we modify this old rule and change it to the popular vote, because it's simply unfair to all the hardworking people that leave work early and have to wait in line for hours to fill out a little white paper. The Electoral does not allow for everyone's voice to be heard. Clearly, the Electoral college must change to the popular vote because of the winner take all method, & the confusion. To begin with, the Electoral college is outdated because of the winner take all system. Even if the votes are off by one, whichever partygets the most popular votes gets all of the electoral votes; the United States are basically saying everybody else's voice that voted doesn't matter. This winner takes all system also deals with population, the bigger the state the more electoral votes. This ancient system is clearly stating the citizens of the smaller states votes do not matter. Although, the winner take all method induces the candidates to focus on the toss up states, it's still unfair to everyone. In addition, the Electoral college is irrational because of all of the confusion and trust issues. Many of the citizens in our country don't even know what an electoral college is! Plus the fact that most people think they're voting for the president, but in reality they're voting for the slate of electors. It's also possible the electors that represent your party votes for the other candidate! Another major reason the Electoral college must be abolished is because the citizens do not even get to choose their very own electors! It's like buying a new car while being blindfolded and believing the dealer the car runs fine. Everyone's going to have skepticism so they should at least let the citizens choose their own electors. Then again, the Electoral college avoids run off elections. In conclusion, the Electoral college was once a good idea for a starting country, but we now live in a elite dynasty that must have a few modifications on how the citizens elect their leader."
573,0,"Phones and Driving Over 400,000 casualties occur annually due to distractions while driving (Vegega, pg 3). Many of these distractions are due to phones, an ever-growing distraction for drivers. Due to this risk drivers should not be able to use phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle because of the growing threat towards drivers and pedestrians and potential cost of damages. Since recent years phones have been a more common distraction for drivers. Growing distractions such as the usage of cellular devices poses a threat to drivers. From 2012 to 2015 crashes involving cell phones have increased by 15% from roughly 60,000 to 69,000 (NHTSA, pg 3). Therefore the usage of cellular devices while driving has led to a growing threat for drivers. Furthermore, distractions while driving also poses a risk to pedestrians. Of the 3450 fatalities in the US during 2016 caused by car crashes due to distractions 462 (13%) are pedestrians (NHTSA, pg 3). This means distractions such as cell phone usage put pedestrians at serious risk when a car crash occurs. Overall, cell phone usage while driving poses a growing danger toward drivers and pedestrians. Phone usage while driving can cost vast amounts for both governments and drivers. Damaged caused by crashes due to distractions is expensive to replace or repair. In 2010 the cost of damage due to distracted drivers was $22 billion, which is about $26 billion in 2019 (Vegega, pg 3). This data reveals that car crashes due to distractions cost countries billions to remedy, an expense which far outweigh any positives. In addition, drivers also risk paying fines for cell phone usage. In states such as Delaware fines can cost upwards of $50 and come with court fees upwards of $100 (Chaudhary, pg 3). This means that drivers can face severe financial penalties due to cell phone usage while driving. In brief, the financial cost of crashes due to distractions far outweigh the benefits of cell phone use. In conclusion, drivers should not be able to use phones in capacity while operating a vehicle due to the risk towards drivers and pedestrians and enormous financial cost. While driving, drivers are exposed to many types of distraction however, distractions such as phones are in complete control of the driver. Works Cited Chaudhary, N.

24018,0,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I believe this is a good way to go around things for people that are disabled and cant walk or stand easily. Lets say you are disables and its hard for you to walk and your school has stairs but no elevator. Instead of going to school, you can work on your school work at home and not have to worry about having to go up and down the stairs, or bumping into people while you go by. Being able to work on school while at home means you can have experience for when you have a job that you can work remotely for. For example lets say you want to become a proposal manager and you are sick and cant go to work, You will have some experience with working from home and not getting distracted while working because you did it with school work. You will have the proper ability to be able to work and not have to worry if you are going to turn it in on time. Another example i'm going to explain is that you dont have to worry about not having enough time in class to work on a project or paper. When you are at home, you have a lot more time to work on one thing at a time and not have a time limit. So if you are scared that you will not have enough time to turn in the project while you are at school, if your doing the online course you can work on it for a bit, switch over to another class if you need a break, then work on it more. You are not able to do that if you are at school its one subject at a time. One downside to working at home is that you dont get to see your friends as often or make new ones. Because if your at home and not at a public or private school you wont see new people as often as if you where going working at home. Making it difficult to make or see friends. In conclusion if I had the option to work at home I would like to do it. Mostly because i suck at turning in things that are do while I have distractions at school from being with friends or people talking. So if there is an option to work on school at home I would take it."
14477,0,"In my personal opinion, I think that students should decide on their own. I mean if they're eight-graders, they should be smart enough and decide on their own on what they want, or don't want to do. For me, I would choose helping the community, 'cause if you think about it, your actually doing it for your own goods, maybe in some points your not, but most of them from peoples personal experiment's basically, your doing it for your community and your country, the world and people that are around you. What i would do, I would make a list from easiest, to hardest on helping the community, and start from the easiest because at first, your not used to it, and you need to learn how to be responsible for your things, and for what you do. For example, I'll pick, helping students in your classrooms. Then, I might start tutoring my cousins or neighbors, something to start of with, like a practice. If I'll see or think that I'm good enough, I might move on, tutoring Elementary kids. Later on, I'll be a famous tutor! If I'll be doing a good job at tutoring, I might starting subbing for teachers, then they'll ask me to be a teacher! Which means, that now I'll have a job! So basically, I made my own personal carrier just for helping the community! What I'm trying to say, helping you community isn't as bad. If your one of the lucky ones, you'll make your self a carrier, if not, keep on trying! And one important thing to no is, keep on trying, what you give, is what you'll receive."

I agree that many politicains lie these days, but with technology like this can make a better nation out of us. This example is, i feel the best example of the story. Using this technology properly is the safest way to do it, but. I believe that using in a classroom full of students can be a disaster, i am a student myself. It's why i perfer not to be emotionally monitered throught these computer, most likley because alot of things happen putside of school that teachers arn't aware of. So using that type of technology on students, the'yre emothion would constanly be changing due to being around drama in and out of school. Another reason this would not help the students is because they need to learn how dectect these emotions themselves, and so do the teachers. Using this type of technology can help our courts determine wether a criminal is guilty or innocent. We could use this in way to get people out of danger, such Zologist. they feed and tame animal to be less aggressive, if this computer can detect emotion, then it can help avoid attacks from wild animals. This technology is impressive and can be used in different forms to make things better around us, they can make life easier and get us farther in future. being able to make computers that can detect emotion, can make a robot detect when its being theatened, can see when criminals are up to somthing. technology like this can help us get farther then the planets we know now. I my opinion on this is, i can agree it is an amazing invetion, and can be used an a lot of good, and bad ways its just the way people see on using it. we can both beleive that it should be used to get are nation farther then it already is, but lets not let are own technology controls us."
6676,0,"After school activitys, should they be requried to keep all kids active? No I do not think they should be because some kids just dont want to do other extracurricular activitys. I do understand the concept of this however because the principal wants all the kids to be socialy active, however some kids need their alone time or they just do not like talking to other people, and making them do after school activitys can be great for some kids and bad for others. I belive the after school activitys should stay the way they are, If you want to then you can, if not oh well because while some kids love sports clubs and other extracurricuar activitys like myself, others do not, some kids even dislike going to after school activitys, Also some kids are not able to do these things so it may make those kids feel left out if it is ""required"" and they can not do it, or even if the after school activity is something the kid can do at home, lots of kids just dont have the time to do things like that, like me for example I play football (not for my school) and my dad is parylyzed and I have to help him with a lot of things every day and its very time consuming and I barely have time to go to football because of this and I know there a lot of other kids out there who are in a life similar to mine, and just do not have the time to do anything extra that they dont usaly do. Another thing is some kids parents have to be at work when after school activitys are going on so if a kid lives far away fom the school how would they get there if it was required? Then if they where not there their grade or credit or however the school rates/grades the after school activitys attendence numbers would suffer, and that could hurt the kid in the future if they are trying to go to college. I hope this writting has helped you see that required after school activitys should stay optional and that if it was required some kids can be effected in a lot of bad ways, so please keep extracurricular activitys optional."
3298,0,"Summer break, most students favorite time of the year, the time of long hot summer days by the pool or even at the beach. This break given is a moderate period of time given to students and teachers throughout the hottest months of the year. Many children spend this time with their friends and family, some even take the opportunity to get a summer job. However some schools feel it is necessary to give their students an excessive amount of school work to do complete the summer. Many of these summer assignments are from classes including Math, English, and even some AP classes. Most summer assignments given do not provide an explanation of how to complete it, which leaves many students clueless and with no desire to complete their task. Students should be provide to pick an assignment that appeals most to them, in order to give them a drive to complete the work. Summer break is supposed to be enjoyable days away from school with no stress. Giving these students school work over their times off is not fair to them nor is it fair to the teachers. When this work is given, large amounts of students choose not to complete it; or they chose to complete it but not with the best of their abilities. Most summer assignments that are given are not beneficial to the student when they return to school. In fact, many teachers do not discuss the summer assignment with the students and some have even chose to not put in the grade because many of their students did not complete it, which is not fair to the students that took the time out of their summer to complete it. With summer assignments being mandatory, students should be able to choose their assignments based on the classes they will be taking, in order to make their summer a little more enjoyable. No student wants to complete an assignment they have no interest in. Almost all teachers a faculty spend their summer days off relaxing with their families and enjoying their time off, as they should. However they do not grade nor complete assignments for the students. Yes toward the end of the summer teachers have to go back to school earlier than their students to ensure their rooms are set up, cleaned, and ready for the children to return. School faculty also have to attend a few meetings together to make sure the upcoming school year will go smoothly. If students apply their summer time to the assignments the teachers should also apply their time to explaining the assignments throughly before their vaction. A class that students need to have in order to continue learning over the summer, is math. Math is a subject that people use everyday. The assignments math teachers give should provide helpful ways for the student to learn and complete the assignment if it is something they may not know how to do. Most students do complete their summer assignments before summer break, which means they can ask for help from teachers around them. However some wait until they have down time to complete these assignments which causes them to forget how to complete it. All assignments that are given should give the student a clear understanding of how the teacher may want it to be completed, with an example to help assist the student for when the teacher is not around. If the summer assignment that is assigned does not benefit the student and will not be brought up or discussed after they turn it in, it should not be given for them to complete on their days off. The assignments teachers assign are usually not enjoyable and take large periods of time to complete. If assignments must be given over the summer, students should have a choice from a variety of assignments to choose from; such as a power point on somewhere historical they could have visited over the summer or even reading a chosen book the class will read together during the upcoming school year Students should not have to take time out of their days off the complete an assignment that will not help them in the up coming school year. Many students find summer assignments boting and unenjoyable, which is why they choose to not complete them. This is why students should be able to pick an assignment that appeals most to them, in order to give them a desire to do the work."
20595,0,"Dear, Senator of florida is send you this letter to tell you why we need to keep things the way they are. Electoral college is a process in which we decide who will be our president of the United States of America. During this process the Electoral College consist of 538 electors in which 270 of those electoral votes is required to elect the President. During this presidential election you vote for you candidate but what your actually doing is voting for your candidate's electors. All though the electoral colleges have things wrong with it they do have have some positive things that counter the negative out. Like certainty of a outcome,avoiding run-off election,you have to have trans-regional appeal(everyone's President),Swing states, and Big states. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible-it happened in 200-but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. Winning candidate's share the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. For example,Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular vote cast for him and Romney.... Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner- take-all basis. A nationwide electoral vote is possible because 538 is a even number, but its highly unlikely. The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates-as we saw in 2012's election to focus more on toss-up states. As the people of these states are very thoughtful in deciding who they will pick because they are the people that pay close attention to the campaing. The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anarchonism. People believe that it should be changed to who ever gets the most popular votes. People only believe it should be changed because of what has happened in the past with other elections. Like what happened in 200,1960 segregationists in the legislature nearly succeded in replacing the demacratic electors, and the worst being that it ends up in a tie. Things have happened in the past. We dont need to change because of things that happened in 2000 or 1960. Its 2015 and we dont need a change to our way of deciding the president. Theres no reasonto changing it to popular vote."
5705,0,"I believe that more people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. There are many reasons to do so and claims too. Some may not agree, but they should know that joining this can be very helpful to people around the world. One reason people should join is because they get to see the world over. You can look at many different landmarks different while helping people at same time. I know that if you join this program you have many responsibilities, but you will have time to look around at least see the sights. Luke Bomberger, a man who joined the Seagoing Cowboys, was able to go see many Europe and China such as the Acropolis in Greece, Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water, an excavated castle in Crete, and Panama Canal on his way to China. Another reason why you should join is because you'll usually never be bored. There will always be something to do on the ship. Going back to Luke Bomberger, he stated that he fun on ship after animals were unloaded. They played baseball and volleyball in empty holds were animals used to be. They also did table-tenis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games as well. Final reason to reason to join is you'll be helping many people who are in need. If don't know already, many people in different countries don't the items need for survival, and they need them desprately. As a Seagoing Cowboy you'll be providing them many animals that can give them those items. In conclusion,more people should join the Seagoing Cowboys. You'll be able to travel around the world, you'll be able to find fun, and help people in need. Becoming a Seagoing Cowboy will be a good choice in your life."
8230,0,"Venus is the hottest planet in our solar sytem. It could also be one of the most dangerous planets too. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author thinks its a good idea to strive furter into exploring Venus even with the dangers the planet contains. One of the reasons the author beleives we should keep finding new things about Venus is because it was though to be similar to Earth. Venus and Earth are even called ""twins"" because they are thought to be so alike. Venus was thought to once be covered in oceans that could have possibly supported life at a point in time. Venus also contains similar things to Earth like valleys, mountains, and craters. The only way we could figure more things out about Venus would be if we cept sending thigs such as rovers to research it and possibly humans one day. Another reason the author thinks we should find more information about Venus is because Venus is one of the closest planets to Earth in our solar system aside from Mars. Venus or Mars would be the next step in our space exploration. If we do send rovers or people to Venus one day, we would need things that could withstand the heat and other chaos that happens on the surface of Venus. The author states that NASA has came up with an idea that contained a blimp-like vehicle that would hover about 30 miles above the surface of Venus that would carry scientists and would allow them to study the surface. The temperatures inside the blimp would be about 170 dagrees Fahrenhet and air pressure that would be close to sea level on Earth. The conditions would be rough, but humans can withstand it. Though Venus is dangerous, that doesnt mean it's not possible for humans or rovers to explore its surface one day. Humans are driven by curiosity that leads us into similar places. If we can make it to the Moon, we can most likely one day make it to Venus and back. If humans were to one day even land on Venus, it would be a giant achivement for the human race."
25276,0,"Everybody makes decisions. Whether you realize it or not, you make many decisions everyday. Sometimes when we try to make decisions we struggle to do it alone. For example, figuring out what to wear, what to eat, or maybe even where to go. When we struggle to choose on our own, can getting advice or opinions from others help? Choices are made everyday. Good choices, bad choices, little choices, big choices. You almost always have a choice to make about what's going on. What happens if you can't make a decision by yourself? This is when you begin to ask your friends or family. Everybody has an opinion, so you will always have somebody to help you out. In fact people usually give you their opinion, even if you don't ask. For example, you tell someone that you prefer dogs over cats, they will most likely tell you which animal they prefer of the two. You can always rely on somebody to give you an opinion or advice. Most people tend to ask their friends about smaller decisions, and their family about bigger decisions. The advice your family gives, is much different from your friends. Your friends are good for giving advice about clothes, or social media. Your parents can give good advice about school problems, or friendship issues. This is most likely beacause your parents have been there before, and they know what it's like. Either way asking a friend or family member can change your mind to help you make a decision. It is always a good idea to get assistance making a decision if you are struggling to make one alone. Everyone around you may see each situation differently. This is good because when you ask for advice from multiple people, they may help you to look at something in a different way. There is no harm in asking for advice beacause if you do not agree, you can simply ignore it and listen to your mind. You make many decisions on your own, but never be afraid to ask for advice. The benefits of simply asking are endless. In conclusion, asking for multiple opinions is a good idea because you may be able to see the situation from a different point of view. This may even give you more options. Advice from friends and family can often push you toward the right decision. In moments of confusion or misunderstanding, remember you always have somebody to talk to, and get advice from. However, you should not get opinions about everything, we need to make decisions on our own sometimes."

Having to change a policy a such as removing students with below a B grade average is a important thing to do especially if your player is not doing so great education wise. It can help them pick up their grades. It is also a good consequence to show that without good grades, you are not allowed to play. The policy of removing those with low grade average off their sports team is a good idea, because it helps your student stay on track and pick up their grades. Being excused from a sport event due to grades, can show the student that he or she needs to spend less time practicing with the team and more time getting better grades. I, being a sports player, know that without grades, I cannot play a game or attend practice. This gives you time to make up missing assignments, get extra credit, get a better grade, and continue doing that sport you like to do. This policy is also good because you need to give consequences to those who do not do well in school. Yes, getting in trouble with coach is bad, but school is important. Without a great education, the chances of becoming a professional athlete become very slim. You need grades, and good practice to make you a great player and a great student. Having good grades, reminds me that I can create a better future, and not worry about being excused from my team. Many of you may agree with my opinion about this policy, but I know some of you may have some concerns. Maybe one of these concerns is that your student won't proceed with getting good grades. Well the solution to that is simple, no grades, no play. I understand, as a athlete myself, having to be excused due to grades is bad and can get me a little upset. But I know, without my grades, I won't be allowed back on the team. So as you can see having a policy such as this one is good for the school, and your students. It helps them get back on track. It is also good consequence for those that don't get good grades. Just remember, being strict isn't all that bad because"
7151,0,"Do you ever get bored at home after school? Also, Do you wish you had the opportunity to meet more people? Then you could benefit from doing a extracurricular activity. I agree with the principal deciding all students must participate in a extracurricular activity. I agree with this decision because there is a wide range of activities, there should be at least one activity that will fit a students personality, and it will get students involved with the school. First off, there is a wide range of activities that should fit all students. For instance, the activates are accessible. there are many activities. Therefore, at least on activity should fit into the students schedule. They are accessible because of the range of activities, at least one activity should fit with your child's personality. With such a wide range of activities there are endless possibilities. Another reason I agree with the principal deciding students must participate in a extracurricular activity is because it can help students be more social. For example extracurricular activities can help students make new friends. When I did a extracurricular activity at school in elementary school I met my best friend Allison, who I am still friends with today. Along with, extracurricular activities being able to help students make new friends, extracurricular activities can also help develop teamwork skills. In the movie Moana, Moana and Maui started off not liking each other at all, but after working together for a while they became best friends. Another example is, students can get to know the staff of the school better. Staff members can share there none school related activities they enjoy doing to students. As you can see, doing extra curricular activities can help you meet some of your closest friends. Finally, students can be more involved with the school when they participate in extracurricular activities. One reason students can be more involved in school is, they can help the school. When students pay to do the extracurricular actives they can help the school have better resources. Schools will be able to buy supplies and help repair and damage to the school that may occur with the money coming from extracurricular activities. Also, there will be education opportunities. The students will be able to communicate among themselves and share ways to improve there daily school experience. Lastly, students will be able to make school a more enjoyable place. For example the art club could paint murals around the school bringing a happier environment. Can you imagine how great place school would be if everyone pitched in? I agree with the principal deciding all students must participate in a extracurricular activity. First off, there is a wide range of activities that should fit all students. For instance, the activates are accessible. there are many activities. Also because of the range of activities, at least one activity should fit with your child's personality.

7649,0,"I agree that you should have one extracurricular activity. It helps kids learn more and help them become a better student and a student athlete. These are examples of what could help students become a better student or become a better student athlete and those are Football, Math Clubs and the benefits of joining the clubs. Football is a great extracurricular activity its a great way for you to be a team working athlete and student. the sport is great for what it is but it teaches you a lot of team work. Football is great for being stronger especially with all the training. most of the training is footwork, how to be in a proper stance and just making sure your in the end zone when they need you to be. Just because you play football doesnt mean they dont check your grades. Football coaches are always on you about your grades, your grades matter because you are a student athlete. the benefits of playing football is just making sure you have great time management because practices are long and might not have time to do all of your home work. i think football is great extracurricular activity Math club is another great extracurricular activity! its a great way for you to learn math and even compete if your great at the subject. math is a really hard subject you've gotta be onto of it and write lots of notes for you to get it, it takes a lot of time but it defenintly gets u smarter and gets you into the mood to take notes for other classes. math is very hard, but doesnt mean you cant be great at it thats why they offer u opportunities to compete in competitions. the benefits of being in a math club is always making sure u are good at the subject and just having good time management. football and math clubs are great extracurricular activities, but the benefits of it are what u need to know to succeed in them. Having good grades is huge for those extracurricular activities they wanna see that your doing good at school. In football they wanna make sure you understand that being a student athlete means to be doing good in school and making sure your smart about your decisions so u have time to do all your school work and other things outside of school and sports. for math club they want to see the same. they want to see that your doing great ins school and making sure you are being great at the subject you enjoy. Time management is a very important thing to be aware of. As an example if you had a 2 hour practice at 7:30-9:30 u should realize that right after school u should go home do school work or whatever is needed to be done before your practice and thats all done thats something called time management because you are aware of what u have to do and when u need to do it. reasons why kids should have extracurricular activities are just making sure they something to do during the day, especially with a subject they like or even maybe just to try something new. so having one extracurricular activity helps kids find something new and to enjoy to have some company during he day. this will even help kids get smarter in a subject they usually dont like or they could be good at it without even knowing and be great it so thats why i agree with kids having one extracurricular activities. football, math clubs and the benefits of the extracurricular activities is why i agree with having at least one extracurricular activities will help kids be smarter, have team working abilities, and of course being able to try something new or to do what they love!"
22701,0,"The majority of students have to walk the dreadful halls of one's school everyday for seven hours to receive an education, but some schools offer students the option to take classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Students would benefit from this because students would potentially gaining more free time, avoid social conflicts, be more successful in the classroom, and have a healthier lifestyle. By the time students arrive at school and by the time students departure, morning has passed into late afternoon. One reason why students would benefit from classes at home would be the potential extra free time students would gain. If classes were attended at the comfort of home, students could work at one's own pace which means each student could design what time class starts and finishes which would allow students to be more active in ones community, make more time for relationships, and have more time to find ones passions. The classroom can be negative space filled with hate and social conflicts. Although school classrooms touch on these negative topics, which can relate to real world problems that can help a student cope with hate, students would overall still benefit from class at home. Not all students have the same values or personalities which can lead to students exchanging hateful words to one another which could put ones mental state and self confidence at risk. If classes were attended at home, students lives would benefit by avoiding unnecessary hate and potentially have a more stable mindset and happier life. A majority of students lives in a school's classroom is a 25:1 ratio, which means students do not receive as much attention from teachers as one should. If classes were online or through video conferencing, it would benefit student's academic life because the student would directly contact the teacher and not have to fight for the teacher's attention, which would result in being more successful in the classroom. Since the school day begins so early, it has effected the sleeping schedules of students which is effecting students efficiency in and outside the classroom. Another reason why students lives would benefit from class at home would be that since the student could design ones schedule, that extra time could not only benefit students social lives but, also their sleep schedule, which would result in a healthier life style. Alongside sleep, what is put into ones body also effects ones mood and work efficiency. Some students simply do not have time in the morning to pack ones lunch, which results in those students purchasing school lunch which majority of the time consists of chips and french fries which does to give the body the right energy or those students do not eat at all. If classes were attended at home students would be able to eat healthy lunches which benefit the health of students allowing students to have more energy to focus on ones schoolwork and passions. In conclusion, schools should offer students the option to attend class at home because it will benefit the lives of the students by potentially gaining free time, avoiding social conflicts, being more successful in the classroom, and having a healthier style which will potentially make students lives improve while still receiving an education."
13424,0,"The Face on Mars The face on Mars is a mysterious object Mainly because how it resembles a human face from the first picture in 1976 but that picture is outdated. One of the most recent picture taken in 2001 shows that the ""face"" is actually just a landform that appears on Earth and it is common in the American West. This landform is that appears commonly on Earth is known as a mesa. If the face on Mars was proof of an ancient civilization on Mars NASA would have better funding than it allredy has and there would be more exploration on Mars. Although the Face on Mars has become an icon in pop culture that dosen't change the fact that it is just a mesa and at that time the camera wasn't nearly as advanced as what we have now. The combination of cameras that werent nearly as good as the cameras that we have now and the shadows that the image had on it made it look very similar to a human face when NASA first took a picture of the mesa. More current pictures show that what looks like a human face in one picture actually is an average land formation on our own planet. So in conclusion the Face on Mars is nothing more than a naturial land formation that can happen on Mars and Earth."
22444,0,"Do you think distance learning is beneficial for school students? Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Other believe distance learning as an option is not beneficial to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I believe distance learning is not beneficial for school students because of classwork, homework, and sports. First of all,I believe distance learning is not beneficial for school students because classwork in schools is good source of grades in school. The best way to gain knowledge is to going school and learning new stuff by your teachers. When you go to school you do assignments and class activities with your classmates and you all work in groups by helping each other. You meet your friends and teachers who help you in many situations. If you don't understand any topic in class you can go at raise or stay after school to discuss any problem with them. An example: I went to the school I had a test on that day and I got less marks on that test so I asked my teacher that can I retake my test he said that come after school I am available so I went after school make up my test and got good grades. These are the opportunities so more I got when I go to school regularly. I took one online Maths class and seems hard for me because I had so much work for that class and that made me unconscious for certain days. Present in classroom is to helpful for most of students and for me. Moreover,I believe distance learning is not beneficial for schools students because homework in school is a main source for your grades. If you are going to school regularly you get homework with you and you can do that homework by the help of your teachers if you don't understand your homework. By being at home you will not be able to discuss your homework problem with your teachers and when you don't submit your homework your grades will start to reduce. when you will do any test or quiz you will get less marks because of your homework practice. An example: My friend never turn his homework because he thinks homework grades are not important for getting good grades at the end of the year when he got his final marks he had B instead of A because of his not submitted homework. Additionally, I believe distance learning is not beneficial for school students in sports because when you take online class you won't be able to participate in any school sport activities. Because If don't do practice for sports you will be not selected in games such as football, Soccer, and Basketball. The requirements for sports is good stamina, strength, and game techniques. when you come to school all the requirements are fulfill by your school coach. He teaches you how make your stamina good, skills, and teach you best technique to win and selected in the sports team. An example: my friend he was doing a online class and he had a trial for his soccer team and he fail at that trial because he was not able to work hard to improve his skill and techniques by the reason of that online class, but now he is taking regular school and he qualify for soccer with the help of school coach. Finally, distance learning is not beneficial for schools students because of classwork, homework, and sports. Therefore, I believe that distance learning shouldn't follow in school because regular schools helps students to improve their classwork performance, homework performance, and to be good in sports by making good physical."
623,0,"Cell phones have become very popular over the past few years. New phones are coming out so more and more people are buying phones. Almost all people that operate a vehicle have a cell phone. Drivers should not operate a cell phone while driving. Drivers should not use a cell phone while operating a vehicle. Because texting and driving can lead to bad accidents. According to research last year over one million accidents happened in the united states in 2018. Texting and driving is very distracting to drivers on the road. Many states have made this illegal but all states need to crack down on this so the accidents will go down in the future. Texting and driving can also lead to death. The rate of death is very high for texting and driving every year it causes up to half a million deaths. The death rate is so high because people are careless about being on their phone while driving. They risk the chance of hurting others because of their bad habits. Texting and driving is very dangerous because it leads to bad accidents and deaths. Drivers should stop doing it and police need to crack down on drivers that do it. If this happens accidents while driving would dramatically decrease and deaths would decrease. Texting and driving should stop, and we can make that change."
22098,0,"Dear principal, I think hat student should b allowed to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free time, as long as the phones are turned off during class time and im going to tell u why. statistics shows that five out of every ten students have emergencies in school and might b embarrassed to tell any one about it and if they where allowed to use there phones during that free time they could call a parent or a close friend to come help out with the situation. Now i think that's better than having the whole entire school knowing about your business. Another reason is that a family issue could happen at anytime, don't you think that, that child should have some kind of communication with there family when this such thing does occur? Also what if a student wasn't in class when the teacher assigned homework and it was to late for that student to go back to the class and see what the assignment was? They could easily pull out there phone and send a text to a friend asking what was assigned for homework instead of getting a zero on that particular assignment. Don't you think that if using phones during free periods to do this such thing would help bring up student grades? Allowing student to use there cell phones during school hours may have its up's and down's. but on the bright side student wont become so bored with school and decide to skip classes to hang out on the streets during school hours. When you where a child didn't you wish that you could use your phone in school? If so u know how the student feel about this situation. I thank you for you for the time u took to read my letter and i hope to sit down and discuss this situation with you face to face. once again thank you! sincerely, STUDENT_NAME"
2189,0,"Was life better when we didnt have cars? There are many advantages to giving up our little priveledge to ride around; If we as a community were to give up having cars we would have less pollution, reduce greenhouse gas emmision and our communities would improve rapidly. We need to give up cars to form a better more safe environment for our families. First off, an advantage to limiting car usage would be less pollution in our areas. ""Cold nights and warms days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emmision""(Duffer 15). ""In source 2 ""Paris bans drving due to smog"" it also shows that becuase of the enourmous amount of smog from cars they had to ban driving. After just 5 days of no car usage, the amount of pollution was down 60 percent. We as a people have to realize how drastic that change is. All we have to do to help the environment and nature grow more efficiently is to not use our cars as often. Another advantage to lessoning our use in automobiles is the reduction of green house gas emmision. ""...Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emmisions in Europe...""(Rosenthal 5). There our many programs and agencys trying to reduce greenhouse affects; such as the one above, by banning the use of cars; one being the Environmental Protection Agency. President Obama is also trying to curb the United States greenhouse gas emmisions as shown in source 4 ""the End of Car Culture."" David Goldberg, an official of the Transportaion of America says ""All of our development since World War 11 has been centered on the car...""(Rosenthal 7). We as a people are so induldged with cars and how efficent they may be in some aspects we dont realize the harm its doing to our communities. Lastly an advantage to the limitations of car usage, is our communities improving rapidly. An example of this is The day without cars improvement campaign in Colombia, shown in source 3. During this day people that lived in those areas would have to ride a bike, hike, take a bus or walk to work or scool. Becuase of this there was no traffic jams and parks and sports centers bloomed. Also, becuase so many were envovled in this, the sidewalks and streets were improved and new restaurants and shopping centers were developing. In all, The effects of limiting car usage would cause less pollution, lesson the amount of greenhouse gas emmision and cause our communities to improve rapidly. Fellow citizens we could change the way we live for the better. limiting the use of cars would have a drastic change and help our communites blossom."
8935,0,"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the many risks and rewards of going to Venus are disscused. Venus is the most Earth-like Planet in our solar system and many scientists believe it might have supported life in its past. The author supports their claim that travelling to Venus would be a worthy pursuit very poorly by providing more negatives of Venus-travel than positives. This poor support of the argument can be seen from second paragraph. The author describes how the unmanned missions to Venus have only been able to survive for a few hours. It is also stated that ""not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus for three decades."" No positive effect or example was used leading to the idea that if even unmanned spacecrafts cannot survive than manned spacecrafts certanly cannot survive. This is an example of how the author does not support the claim well. In paragraph three, the atmosphere of Venus is explained. Phrases such as ""far more extreme thatn anything humans encounter on Earth,"" and ""such environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals"" do not help support the idea that exploring Venus would be a worthy pursuit. If nonliving metals would be liquefied, who knows what would happen to flesh and bone. In paragraph four and five, positives of Venus travel are finally given. Very quickly after this however the author goes back to the negatives of travel to Venus. One of the only ways of survival on Venus would be using blimp-like vehicles. In paragraph six this way of travel on Venus is exposed becuase ""most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere."" This would mean that photographs and videos could not be taken becuase of the lack of light. Also since humans cannot be on Venus's surface, no rocks or samples could be taken. This would make Venus-travel not worth all the risk. In the very last line of the article, the author wrote, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" Risky and dangerous tasks should not be pursued just so that the immagination can be fulfilled but so that humans can gain meaningful insight on life and the universe. In conclusion, the author does a poor job at explaining how studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. More negatives about this travel and study are given than positives. This means the author did not support his suggestion well."
21401,0,"Dear Principle, The two policies you are having to choose from are very negotiable. Having no cell phones at all at school probably would not go over very well. I think that will not stop students from bringing them, and will just influence them to using them in secrecy. This policy will bring more on you, by having to punish the kids that are bringing them to school anyway. Most students break this rule as it is. There is no harm in having cellular devices on school property, unless there is misuse of them, or they are distracting the class from learning. My opinion is that we should be allowed to bring our cell phones to school, and use them during free time, lunch, or passing periods. During these times we are not supervised by s teacher, or are distracting anyone from the school regulations. Plus, it would be very helpful if you have an emergency, or need to get a-hold of someone for a ride or anything worth needing contact. You could have a rule that if your phone is not turned off during class, than you may serve a detention and get your phone taken away for the rest of school. I see my teachers on their phone constantly. They occasionally have it turned off during class, but every once and a while it will disrupt our class. If it is their job to be here and they have their phones on, then why cant we? Teachers nor students should have their phones during class, or while learning. You must keep the rules mutual. Phones are a minor speed bump during our school day. We should not let it become a big deal, and just keep the use at a minimum. I believe you should make the rules that you may only turn your cell phones on during passing periods, lunch, or free time. Any down time of your day is acceptable. Other than that there will be consequences. This new policy will sound fair to everyone and will keep the commotion down. Students will respect that you let them use it then, let alone at all. They will most likely follow the rules. This is the best way you should go to have a fair school day. Keep your options in mind. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME"

I think it is a got idea because there is to much stuff just wasted in this world I mean just by recycling you are helping a lot. Student should all care about our environment. There is a ton of people all over the world that are trying to keep the environment safe and save the wildlife that is around us. The students should care about what we have in our life. I really think that every student should just do something to help our environment and that we should all do some community service to help the environment. I do not understand why you wouldn't help the environment. Look at all the different places in the world that are just covered with trash and other things. Look at all the places that have been in war and are still cleaning up from it like Vietnam we are still to this day looking for so of the American MIA/POWS that are still missing or the dead men that have never made it home for battle. People in general just need to help to cleanup our nation and this world. Look at the people who are unemployed cry about how they have no money wait I have a solution to that problem recycle can and other items.

And my evidence that supports my claim is that the NASA is been working and studying on approaches of Venus, one of the examples that they have found is some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide that have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos on Venus's surface. Venus still features such as valleys, mountains, and craters to recall Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit. My introduction is about Venus is that the value of the indisputable of it is where the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive. My body that Venus is the same as Earth since their twins since their close to each other in terms of density and size and Venus even orbits the sun at different speeds. And my conclusion is Venus has a atomosphere at almost 100 percent of carbon dioxide and more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid on Venus that makes the hottest surface temp of any kind of planet in the solar system in outer space."
6612,0,"Have your parents ever forced you to do a sport? You usually end up not having fun. If you're doing activities against your will, why would you want to bring that to school? Extra curricular activities shouldn't be enforced because it interferes with the parents' schedule, it takes away the students' factor of choice, and it prevents teachers from going home at their typical time. To start off, enforcing after school activities isn't a great idea because it can interfere with parents' schedules. For example, parents might not be able to pick up their kids late, possibly due to the fact that they need someone to help out with their younger children. If kids are held after school, the parents will need to rearrange their schedule in order to be there for their kids. In addition, this policy could prevent the parents from being able to pick their kids up. depending on how late the extracurricular activities run, parents could be busy with other things, such as grocery shopping, by the time their kid gets out of school. Also, some parents depend on public transportation. If there isn't a conveniently scheduled bus, the child won't have a way to get home. These scenarios demonstrate how enforcing clubs, sports, or groups can intervene with parents' schedules. Secondly, having extracurricular activities after school as a priority isn't a good idea because it takes away the student's factor of choice. Adding on, children won't be as independent as they would have been, which will effect them later in life. If they don't build their individuality now, then they could possibly have trouble with it in years to come. In addition, students could feel controlled. If these policies are made, kids could feel like they don't have a say in what goes on in their space of education. Also, children will have to schedule their outside life around after school. They might be put in a position where they have to let go of activities they're passionate in, simply to not get in trouble at school. These three examples show why extracurricular policies will take away a child's choice. Lastly, making extracurricular activities a necessity isn't an great decision because it forces teachers to stay later. To start, teachers have a life after school, and staying later than normal could interfere on that. Also, educators might have to complete chores, such as buying groceries, before a certain time each day. Having them stay late could throw off their whole routine. Lastly, many teachers have kids of their own. Depending on their age(s), they will get dismissed from school at different times. This is why necasary extracurricular activities will affect a teacher's schedule. As shown in these paragraphs, enforcing extracurricular activities can affect the parents' everyday plan, prevent kids from making their own choices, and interfere with teachers' after school life. Holding back students affects more than just the kids. It affects everyone involved, and more. With these explanations, hopefully you won't be forced to play a sport or join a group again."
15764,0,"Dear Principal, It is outrageous that you think students should have at least a B average to participate in sports or other activities! This is wrong because kids need more exercise, they need something to feel proud about, and they want to make friends on teams or clubs. To start off, kids need something to be proud of. They may not be smart or maybe they just don't like their teacher. If they are not that smart, they feel stupid in front of their parents and friends. Being on a sport's team or in a club would make them feel like they accomplished something. For instance, kids may be getting a C average but they are the best actor in the drama club or have the best arm on the football team. Getting bad grades shouldn't make them feel like they don't have a purpose in life but rather signify that their purpose in life is not to be a rocket scientist or a chemical engineer but to use their skills to entertain their family, friends or fans. Next, kids these days need more exercise. Most of them sit around playing sports video games when they can be out playing the real thing! For some kids, the only exercise they get is in gym class or on sports. I'm sure parents would rather have their kid playing linebacker instead of pretending to be one on Brett Favre's team. Also, kids can meet random people playing video games and may want to meet them in the real life. With voice changer technology, people can make their voice sound lower or higher, matching a kids voice. Last of all, kids want to make friends! Their not going to make any real friends watching Spongebob dance around under a rock, they are going to make friends that have the same interests at them, such as a forensics club. If kids sign up for forensics, they will meet other kids that like it too. They go to different schools in the area. They could make friends in all of these schools! They all like forensics and, who knows, maybe they have something else that they all like to do. To conclude, students who have lower than a grade B average (which is many of them) would miss out on that ""proud"" feeling, they would have a hard time making friends, and they wouldn't be getting most of the exercise that should be getting."

Many families have lost many things, and this would be the chance for you to help them regain them. You would be highly honored for your striking courage. My second reason is that you would be able to see global landmarks throughout your journey. Luke was a witness and he said that, ""the trips were an unbeleivable oppurtunity for a small town boy."" You would learn what it is like to travel far and wide across the Atlantic Ocean. My last reason is that not only would you be able to see global landmarks, but you would also be able to enjoy yourself throughout the trip. The passage states that the cowboys played baseball, volleyball, table tennis, fencing, boxing, and reading, whittling, or games also helped pass some of the time. You wouldn't just have to sit there and do nothing when the work was finished, you would be able to entertain yourself with activities.

24891,0,"Have you ever heard the term majority rules? It means if more than half rule on one side, then that side will win. Many organizations and committees use majority rules because it means they are taking advice from multiple people and not just one. Taking opinions from multiple people may help someone with making a better choice. I believe it could give options to the wisdom-seeker, it could make them confident about one choice that they could go with, and it would mean they would have multiple arguments for a side. When someone takes an opinion from multiple people, they have more choices/pieces of wisdom. If a person is writing an article and needs advice on what to write, they go to one person and only get one piece of advice to help them with their article. If they go to multiple people, they have options to weigh and decide what they want to write on. One example of this is Congress. Before any bill passes, they all take a vote. Whichever side is more than half will win, which is majority rules coming back into play. Congress does this to see what others have to say about the topic, not just what one person has to say. This is one of the reasons why taking more than one opinion can help someone make wise choices. Last summer, I played on a travel basketball team that went to Maryland every weekend and played in a tournament. I was the point guard on the team, which meant that I was the captain on the court. I was calling plays, running pep talks, and keeping my teams head up. One Saturday, my dad and I drove up to the tournament and when I got there, all my teammates were excited. They started telling me about how easy our schedule was and how we could easily win this tournament. Our first game came and on the first play of the game, I twist my ankle. I sat the rest of the game out and my 2nd game as well. I told my dad that I would be fine to play in the championship but he told me that I couldn't. I asked my coach and he told me that I should not take the risk. I was mad that my coach and my dad said I shouldn't play, but we still ending up winning. The moral of the story was that I took my dad's and my coach's advice and decided not to play. Since I got the advice from 2 trusted adults that I knew, I understood that it was probably the smartest decision for me to make. Taking advice from multiple people can make someone more confident about their choice on the topic. Getting multiple opinions on a topic such as a debate article may not always mean he/she is right, but it means that they have multiple people's arguments on the topic. For example, if I asked around about child soldiers and I had multiple people tell me that they shouldn't be given amnesty, I could use their arguments to my side even if they should be given amnesty. If someone takes advice from different people and they all tell you along the same lines of the same piece of advice, they could use it even if it's wrong, because they have people standing behind them with the same argument and same reasons. Taking advice from multiple people is more helpful than taking it from 1 person because it helps give options to someone who might need it for a test or a scenario in their life. It is also helpful when someone knows the advice they need but they want to check with others to see if they're thinking the same way about the scenario. The last reason of why it is important is because even if someone takes advice from many others and the advice is wrong, he/she has their arguments to help you out. This information is very important at the moment because right now the world is tasked with something they could use a lot of advice on. The Coronavirus is a disease that has 115,000 cases all around the world and the U.S. has 574 cases. The world has not found a cure yet and I believe that scientists are trying to find the cure themselves so they can get all the credit. If all the scientists in the world worked together and used each others advice and equipment, we could find a cure very easily and quickly. This is an example of using multiple people's advice because there could be 2 scientists who are very close to finding the cure and if they work together they could easily find the cure."

The way this works. You just can not use just some simple gaming PC. Thers this computer based opperation that can describe your mood or how you feel, but is this safe to use around children and is the world ready for this kind of technology?. There are pros and cons on using this for people in the outside world. Some pros are, it is very interesting to see how it works. Kids cold see how the muscles in your jaw and sides of your mouths flex and pull just make that simple smile that you never wanna make when grandma wants to take a picture with you. Also it could show a kid a feeling they do not notice or feel about themselves. Say your thinking of doing anything harmful to someone or to yourself the system can probably see that through the system. Some cons are, what if a child or teen is going through a lot, and they do not want there feeling shown. What if it shows depression in the smile. Also the story says there are many doctors that have worked on this facial recognition system, and it could really be complex. The doctors are two smart doctors all over, Professer Thomas Huang from Beckman Insitute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois. Also, Professer Nicu Sebe of University of Amsterdam. Some kids might think it is like a Transformer. The question I have is how can they do the prcess ona painting from Italy. Well just the right way it is positioned. Do I think it should be in a classroom? No, because it could bedangerous with all the technology. Do I think kids should at least know how it wrks and what th computer looks like? Yes, because this our new generation, technolgy will never stop being created. You can not stop technology. In conclusion, the computer based media can be used in and positive way and negative way also. So tech can be useful some does not even have to chance to make it in the outside world. But, using it to describe how you feel and why you feel, how bad can that be?"
16428,0,"Dear principal, I have heard that you are changing the school policy. That students may not participate in any after school activities without a grade B average. I would have to agree because of multiple reasons. That is that it would make students work harder at school work. Second, Many students do not pay attention to their school work more so than they do their activities. Third, The after school activities are great for your future, but it doesn't mean you shouldn't do good in school. I will explain why I think so in these short explanatory paragraphs. First, Students with a grade C average will work harder to get a grade B average or higher. Those who want to participate in activities will not want to quit their club if they are really into it. They will try harder and be less lazy when it comes to school. They will be motivated. They will try their best to be in any sport or club they want. Second, They will have no distractions. Because of after school activities, student are often busy. They often don't complete homework and often don't study. With after school activities out of the way, students will have time to do more things. Even though some fun is good every now in then, you shouldn't let it get in the way of more important things such as your future. Third, School is a big part of their future. The students need to see this. Sure, you may want to do a school activity because you want some practice for who you want to be, but you need school to get you there. No good college is going to accept a C average student. Your future will be ruined. So, as you can see, school is a big part in our lives. That's why I believe that you should change the policy. Students should be taught to not get what they want unless they give something in return. Their hard work and motivation. School will take them to their dreams. Sometimes, you must give up something to gain something. Sincerely yours, STUDENT_NAME"

These greenhouse gases affect our ozone layer in the atmosphere and causes global warming and causes high pollution levels that make it hard to breathe for most people. Some residents in a small suburb in Vauban, Germany are living life without cars and. This little change has helped to drop greenhouse gases in Germany. Many residents believed that at first they were not going to like walking everywhere but they have now realized that they are cutting down on greenhouse gas emmisions from tail pipes and it helps uncroud the streets. Greenhouse gases have a tremendous effect on our atmosphere and the air that we need to have to be able to survive. In Paris, government officials put out a ban on what cars could be used on certain days to try and bring pollution levels down around the global city. The first day was fining motorists with even-numbered license plates after they were oredered to leave their cars at home. The same would be done to odd-numbered motorists the next day. The smog around the city cleared enough on Monday that the French party decided to lift the ban for odd-numbered motorists on Tuesday. In Bogota, Colombia, Colombian officials took a day to have the city completely car free. Many people took buses to work, hiked, biked, or skated, leaving the streets of Bogota eerily devoid of traffic jams. It was the third straight year that cars have been banned to try and promote alternative transpotation rather than cars and to try and reduce smog around the city. Two other cities joined the event and participated to try and reduce smog around the smaller cities as well. Some municipal authorities from other countries went to Bogota to see the event and saw how much it helped and are now thinking of doing their own version of the event in their countries. In America, recent studies show that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. Many researchers are wondering if America has passed peak driving. America has been one of the worlds prime care cultures do to its inventions for the car. The United States peaked in 2005 but have steadily dropped thereafter. As of April 2013 the number of miles driven per peson was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. These actions have caused less emission of greenhouse gases from tailpipes into the atmosphere dramatically. Studies are going to see if the driving rate steadily goes down or if it is going to pick back up, to see if less greenhouse gases will be emitted from tailpipes to hepl reduce smog around many major American cities."
10153,0,"Mona Lisa face expressions are different than others face's, depending on how the person look with no smile, no anger, and no saddness. The emotional communication is nonverbal, showing the more emotion there is though our face's. Smile' are all differnet depending if it's a real one or a forced one. Faces don't lie, Smiling isn't being truthful they said. Willing to put on a face, it usually works most of the time, but not only to expresses emotion, it's tells us how they are feeling today or what they are going though. When actors fake a smile or a frown they don't feel it really, they just make the face to prove or hide what they are feeling or showing. They act the show and give what's on the paper and have the same movement that we humans have to use when we express how we feel. We have six basic emotions. Happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and there is sadness. They associated with each of our characteristics movements of the facial muscules. ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal."" We have some software tracks on these facial movement that our brain follows, it can find out you're mix emotion and expression by you're neutral face. This not means what you can really see without the tech and just see the real feeling and the real smile or their sadness. This Facial Action Coding System is identifing the moment of the face right that minute, but not what they are feeling right after or before. What I'm tryig to say is that our computers are blind and won't see what's really happening, our faces can lie to computers but not to people who know's what they been though and can see in other human their self. You got to see it deep into their eyes and smile if they are really happy or just really sad within their ife. It's different how the Da Vinci code is, with converting their specific emotoin with the new electronic code."
16678,0,"Dear principal, I believe that it would not be fair to the students that are incapable of receiving a B grade average to not be able to enjoy their school activities! why? Well because those are the classes were we all just take a brake from other subjects like math, science and other subjects that we may take! Besides we need some of these classes for example physical education in this class not only do we have fun with our friends and take brakes from learning but we also get fit and in shape and this is something that's important for your health! Further more, there are a lot of students that are in tutoring from Monday through Friday up to 6:00 pm and now even taking our personal time to come to a program like Saturday academy! Too much learning is bad for students we all need a brake from that and when we take those special school activities is when we get to have that brake! Do to the fact of all that i have just explained, I beg of you to please just let us have these special activities these are activities that we just simply need! I hope that me taking the time and writing this letter to you will convince you to allow everyone in the school to be able to enjoy these activities! I would also appreciate it if you would let me know what your final decision will be. sincerely, STUDENT_NAME"

To many technology gives away many diffrent emotions though. Technology sometimes makes people happy, mad, sad upset, frustrated. But if technology could read our emotions, just imagine the wow factor. Technology should very well be tested and who else to test it on instead of students that are in school. Studets are the best test subject for a couple reason, but there is really only 1 good reason, and that is becasue most of them are teenagers to young adults. Facial reconization technology would be great for society. A great example would be during a presidental election. Now in the article it states that with this technology, would we be able to if poiliticans were lieing or not. When U.S. watches the election wouldnt it be nice to know if a politican would actualy was telling the truth, because the the citizens of America they are told one thing that that canidate would do once in office and as a country we vote for them, just for them to never fufill there promise. The people never know who to trust anymore, and to the point to many people just decide not to vote, becuase no one can belive a politican. in the article it says this tech can read the face of Mona Lisa herself, but shes just a painting. Imagine a child who doesnt understand whats going on, they need help but dont know how to tell anyone. They can be scanned and be given help. The value of using this new equimepnt of students would be tremondus. it would give what the scientists need to be build a machine that could eventuallly produces medicines that could end up changing the world. many people think that studenttesting would be a horrible thing not only to do, but harmful to them and possibly thinking it could harm them,but the future we could have with technology would greater thanks to them and this device"
1108,0,"Phones & Driving Well to begin with, I think drivers should not be able to use cellphones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. I think drivers shouldn't use cellphones in any capacity while operating a vehicle because it's very dangerous. Texting and driving or even looking at something on your phone while driving can be very risky for you. Personally i wouldn't text and drive. When driving you have to be very cautious. Cautious for you, not only you but other too. First off texting and driving is illegal. If you get caught by the police you can get a ticket for it or worse. Majority of the people today don't care. They would rather text back immediately when it only takes a couple of seconds to park your car. I know for a fact it's dangerous because just a month ago my cousin and 6 of my friends got in a bad accident. The accident was so tragic that my cousin and 4 other friends died and only one of them manage to get out. The driver that hit their truck was drunk. Not only was he drunk but he was texting as well. When driving you should never text. If you think the message is that important you should at least go park your car and go from their. They have commercials on tv about texting and driving. Also on billboards, youtube, and etc. A lot of people text and drive still to this day. But it's most definitely not safe. I think banning cellphones while driving would be a good thing to do. Everyday people die from car accidents. Because of the use of using their cell phones while driving. We've all became attached to our cell phones. However there is a dangerous side to cell phones. That is using it while driving. It is very dangerous. Also it can cause of harm to yourself, not only yourself but others as well. When you are driving you have to be cautions and know that your driving for others too;"
9084,0,"The Challenge of Exploring Venus In this story the author is talking about Venus. Alot of people could care less about the planets but its a big part of the world today. In this story its talking about Venus and everything people need too know about it. I think the author in this passage described Venus well. He/she explained everything about Venus, The size, were its located, how hot it is etc. I think this cause in passage 1,2,3 it gives alot of information on Venus. And the author organized the facts really well by putting alot of facts in each paragraph and focusing on that and giving alot of information on that subject. In paragraph 4 it talks about how Venus is almost like the earth and how maybe one day they would like too visit. This is a huge thing cause if so we could have another planet of life. So in conclusion i think this article was very well planned and had just the right amount of infomation for a average person too learn and know about."
22429,0,"I agree that students would benefit better on taking online classes and video conferencing at home. Most of the students prefer online classes because they can't get transportation from home to class. Video conferencing and online classes would benfit students in a way that their will be less distraction and work in your own level. Society now in days has many bullies in school that it comes to the point that studuents don't want to come to school and prefer taking class at home by there self. For example I had a cousin that took online class at home because he had no transportation to get to school. He was able to benefit better at home because even when he was sick he would still be able to accomplish his work. Most of the teenagers want to go to school but they can't because they have no way to get to school. Online classes and Video conferencing is way were students can get education and graduate without leaving their house. My cousin got education and he graduated and he only took online classes and it helped him a lot due to not having tansportation to school. There are many kids out in the world thet get bullied in school and they want a education but they can't due to bullys. Classes at home can benefit kids getting bullied in many ways for example, you won't have to worry about getting bullied at home if you take classes at home, you will get less distraction, and you will work in your own level taking classes at home. Therefore, This is why I agree that students can benefit better taking classes at home in many ways. Online classes and video conferencing may benfit some people but due to experience with family members and friends I feel like it benfits most of teens in the world. Not all teens get to have education due to many reasons which is why I feel like it can benefit many teens in taking classes at home."
8765,0,"In the essay ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author does an great job of describing how Venus would be a very worthy persuit depite all of the dangers. Venus is the closest planet to earth. In the essay the author states that it is known as Earth twin. That is in terms of desity and size though. In the essay the author states that ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" This statement in the essay opens many new ideas to support why exploring Venus would be a worthy pursuit. Its starts to make the reader wonder what happened to the planet to make it look the way it does now. Even though it is very dangerous the mission to Venus could posibbly be held to many discorvory's, and this is what the author is telling us he thinks that it is worth it and it definetly is. Then you get the reader wondering how do we study a planet we can't even land on. The text states "" NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the suface of Venus would allow the scientist to float above the fray."" Then the author compares that to flying above storms in airplanes today. This would allow the humans not to get hurt while testing Venus. The author has given the reader a good way to see how it would be possible for scientis to experiment on Venus. That is another way he makes it seem like a worthy pursuit. Last of all he makes a point that this step would not just gain insight of the planet, but it will allow us to target bigger task. The text states ""not only because insight gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intiminadating endeavors."" This alows the reader to devolop a sense to what might happen after they experiment on Venus they will start on another dificult task. The author wants the reader to know that this is all in the devolopment in are world. It will alow us to further and that is great for this world to discorver new places. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author does an amazing job of making sure the reader understand that studying Venus is a worhty pursuit. In the essay he gives us a reason why which is it is the most earth like planet in our solar sytem. Another reason is accomplishing the task of studying venus will allow us to think further and go futher in to are solar system and start discorvering more. Last of all the author gives us a how and that is they would float above the fray. All of these points make the reader beleive that Venus is a worthy pursiut despite all of the challenges and danger that the planet poses."

11547,0,"The new technology called the Facial Action Coding System is very valuable. This new technology will be very useful in a classroom full of students that one teacher may not be able to handle all on their own. The Facial Action Coding System will help deal with many problems by reading a students face. This may help deal with situations a teacher can not figure out on their own. This software may be able to tell the teacher when the student is confused, upset, or even when the student is bored and needs a more interactive subject or way of learning. When a student is confused, they may not ask for help to a teacher. The child may be too shy or nervous to ask for a simple example or explanation. This software program will be helpful because it will be able to read the students confused face and tell a teacher that the student needs help. In the short story in paragraph six it states, ""most communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" This explains how not all people will use words to explain what they are feeling. These students may never speak up for themselves or have the courage to ask a question without the program being here to help deal with the childs needs. The Facial Action Coding System will not only help with students life in the classroom, but it may also help with a students feelings deeper within. The software will be able to pick out the students who are very upset, and need to talk about their emotions to another person. If a student has a sad face in class, the program may be able to identify what is wrong with the child, and it could notify this information to a teacher or a well trusted adult. In paragraph five of this story it states, ""most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."" By having this computer software, it could help out with a students mental emotional feelings as well. This program will also be very helpful in providing a fun learning environment for the students. In the middle of paragraph six it explains how a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming bored. It also states that if you smile when a website advertisement pops up on the computer screen it will show more advertisements like that one. If a person frowns when this pops up, it willl show a different, more appealing advertisement. This can be very useful in a classroom. It may make the students more interested in learning. The students might even be more excited to learn now, because the computer will know that the students happy facial experssions mean they are enjoying the type of way the program is teaching them. The new Facial Action Coding System will be extremeley helpful in a classroom. The students will have a more positive learning environment with this software. The new technology will not only be able to help with a students mental emotions, but it will help them be in a happier state of learning. This new system be more helpful for the students and for the teachers. The Facial Action Coding System is exactly what a school should be using for a overall better work place."

In paragraph 2 it stares that Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hour. That in paragraph 6 it sates that most important that reseachers can't take sample of rocks, gas, or anything else from a distance. That scientists are trying to seek something that would get up close and personal despite the risk. In paragraph 6 it also states that Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus. Also in paragraph 7 its states that by comparison, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces. In conclusion that it is pasable to studying Venus by use technology that can stand Venus risk and there are way for scientists to get close to Venus by use types of machine."

You will have a lot of information and reasonings on why it's that planet or why is it close to the sun. The text gives you a lot of information about venus and why it is called that. As it states ""long ago when venus was covered with nothing but the ocean"", they could of had human life on that planet. You can study venus and maybe found out if there was any human life their besides the oceans that were their. You can be the one who goes to space and can take a look at venus and if it's safe you can probably visit the planet. I suggest that it is a good idea to study venus, you might have a chance to visit the planet venus."
10490,0,"I am against technology being able to read students emotional expressions. We shouldn´t have computers telling exacly how our students are feeling. Some things are personal and some kids might not want other kids to know if there feeling sad, mad, or happy. In paragraph one it tells the percentages on Mona Lisa, that going way to far with personal space and thought. Some things are meant to be un said and if a teacher asks you in class how you felt about that certain situation they can tell if your lying or not, and that´s your choice if you want to express that. Students could be bullied if other kids didn´t like there opinion about something. Even if something made a kid feel happy that something bad happened to another student like personal thoughts, that could be blown out of context. Even though you may not have the brightest look on your face doesn´t mean your not happy, like thousand of kids walk around school with bleh looks and they may actually be happy but just showing that expression, but the computer would read it as sad or mad. Computers are already taking over a lot of things, but when it comes to humans we should´t need a computer to tell us how were feeling. Computers and technology aren´t 100% right, only you would know exactly how your feeling. In conclusion computers shouldn´t be allowed to read students expression. In paragraph 5 Dr. Huang says it isn´t hard to tell whether a friend is feeling happy or sad you should be able to read that, so why exactly do we need a computer doing that? Some things us humans should be able to figure out because its our body and we know how it works. Therefore we shouldn´t need technology going pass our personal boundaries and telling us how we feel. It would just cause more conflict and more wasted money on things we ca just figure out ourselves."
22929,0,"It is known that most students enjoy being at home way more than they enjoy being at school. Taking distance classes its a beneficial idea, because it allows students to get the same amount of learning without leaving their home, if students took distance classes, they would get a sense of responsibility because they would be responsible for doing assignments and turning them in, that is a skill that is going help them in the future, they would also benefit from the idea of being in a more comfortable area, although many distractions are available, they would have to learn to ignore them and focus on the assignment they are working on. Distance learning is a great way of teaching students the responsibility it takes in the real world to actually work and do the assignments without someone making sure you are doing them. students would get more time to do the required assignments, and they would benefit from it, because students would learn time managing skills that are definitely going to help them in their lives after graduation, although it might take some time to get used to the idea that you are responsible for your own learning, at the end of the day is the best way to learn that after graduation you are responsible for your own actions and time. Others may feel that with distance learning students would get more distracted than they would if they had someone guiding them through the assignment; but in reality, students would get the same amount of learning but in a different environment, an environment they are used to since it is their home, although some students will get distracted, sooner or later they would learn and develop focus skills that are necessary in the real world to work and ignore all the distractions that could prevent them from doing their job and getting the work done. Knowing how to avoid those distraction is one of the best skills to learn early on, not only because it will help with school, it will also help throughout their entire life. In conclusion, distance learning is a great way of teaching students not only the normal subjects they are required to learn, but also skills that they will need in their life, such as avoiding distractions, managing time, and focusing on the task that it's being asked. Knowing these skills early on would give them an advantage that will help them in the future."

Natiosn worldwide have vbegun starting a new trend/ orsmartplanning which limits cars usage due to the ecomony,pollution it creates. To begin with, limiting cars is becoming a new fad, people in VAUBAN,Germany(Dorchland) say it saves alot of time and money. Now you can just have your house in the suburbs and just stick to foot traffic youdont have to worry about car insurance or garages or keeping drive ways clean. No more dirty streets clean and motor sound free walking. With this new smart planning going on its harder for people to take there kids around and get to work. What goes along with this effect it saves people more money. Lastly, Limiting usage of cars is going to help better the enviorment. Recently paris was under an enforced ban due to to a cloud of smog pollution. The use of cars releases toxi and bad gases into the atomosphere destroying are enviorment and causing effects on the polar ice caps. The limit use of cars cuts traffic down and time. another effect use we could use is a car free day were we could take buses, bicycles, and even skateboards. one major thing we should replace with our cars is public transports. Inconclusion Limiting cars usage is helpful and becoming more popular globally it can help the economy and also help slow down pollution."

It orbits the sun just like Earth and it is decently close to Earth. Mars is also kind of like Earth but not like Venus is. I think that Venus is very worthly to pursuit but with all the dangers I don't think we should visit, but I do think that we should keep studing. According to the text ""Whille Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved a very callenging place to examine more closely."" This shows that Venus is safe to study here from earth and that there is no dangeres with looking at it with a microscope. This shows that we can study Venus and still be safe here on Earth. I also think that we shouldn't have anyone on a ship go to Venus just yet until we study it more and figure out how to land the ship. According to the text "" Eah previous mission was unmmanned, and for good reason, since no pacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe the issue expalins why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades."" This shows that is is not safe to send people on spacecrafts to Venus woth out them dying in a few hours. I odnt think that someones life is worth a few hours on anouther plant, all though it would be very benfishal. If they owuld take samples of things that we need to look at and some how get it back to us so we can study and get to kow the planet more, but i don't think that it is safe or smart to send people there. Last but not leasat Venus has the hottest surface temperature than any other planet. According to the text "" These conditions are far more exterme than anyhting humans encounter on Earth; such an enviroment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals. Also notable, Venus has the hotterst surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun."" This shows that Venus is not safe and that it is too dangrous to survive. It is too hot and it is too dangrous for any human being. With all of this information we should jsust hang back and study, maybe even try to make a ship that can with stand the pressure or even a suit that can survive with all the heat. We just need to study maybe run some trials on gettings ships there but not with people on them."
22406,0,"School can make some of the social challenges that certain students face more difficult and for others school can create these same challenges. Anxiety is something that many of deal with, some cases worse than others. Anxiety in the classroom is amplified. This can lead to a drop in grades and performance in school. Attention disorders such as ADD an ADHD can make school dreadful at times. Online classes that are taken at home will put the student in a comfortable space in which he or she can focus in their classes without 30 other things happening. Students can go through so much in their own lives, not to forget the fact in which we live in a world of chaos. Tragedies, or ""interruptions"" happen in everyone's life and as students going to school is either not an option or is a very difficult one. Students would benefit from having the ability to take online classes at home. Imagine being in a hallway with what seems like a million new faces every day and you are not familiar with anyone. Making friends is hard when you have anxiety because the most comfortable place is yourself. A student with anxiety can be taking a test that is very challenging and tedious and the walls will seem as if they are beginning to shrink and close that student in. That is anxiety, anxiety is going over a whole conversation and going over what you will say so you dont mess up. Anxiety is scary. As you can imagine, school with 2000 kids everyday can be difficult for students. Working to overcome your anxiety can take a long time and is necessary but better results will be achieved when the student makes the decision for themselves to take classes at school rather than home because some kids just arent ready for that yet. Many students including myself suffer with attention disorders such as ADD and ADHD. You can just take a guess on why this would make school in a classroom hard. ADD and ADHD cause students to struggle to maintain focus and they both do it in different ways. Picture yourself day to day always finding yourself mentally blank, forgetting simple task, Losing your train of thought, and battling your mind trying to do a million things at once. This is the life of many students. Attention disorders can be treated with medication, however many families either cant afford the medication due to lack of health care or refuse to let their children take an addictive controlled substance. Some parents just think that there kid doesnt even try or is just ""dumb"". The 504 plan is a plan that was made to accommodate and assist students with learning disabilities. This plan works by giving students more time to complete assignments and giving students accommodations to put them in a learning environment that will benefit them. Sadly students with learning disabilities are forgotten about and neglected. Unlike children with autism or special needs students with attention disorders take the same classes as the general population. Therefore students 504 plans are followed based on who the teacher is, and sadly some teachers dont care. This means the student will not receive any accommodations such as more time on test. This can lead to poor grades, and not because the student isnt prepared. A student with ADD will have to read a problem 5 times before they really retain the information and even then everything is done slower because when students with attention disorders try to force their brain work too fast that is when things are forgotten and missed. An online class in the peace and quiet of your own home with the things you need to help you focus, things that you cant always have at school will surely benefit this student from an educational stand point and mentally. Life happens. Students go through more than you can imagine. Everyday students deal with the death of loved ones, pregnancies, abuse, sickness. These are things that some adults can barely deal with. As children we are dealing with life's problems for the first time. You can see why that would take a toll on us. Life happens and students go to school and deal with bullying, racism, sexism etc. It is natural that kids who internally struggle with themselves will make others feel small to feel a sense of validation and power. It is not right but that is human nature. However some of our bullies are our very own teachers. A student can be literally be on the verge of suicide and a teacher can give a student a hard time or just be blatantly rude. Teachers are different to students than they are to adults. As an adult you cannot just treat adults any type of way without consequences. Teachers use their power over students to do this because lets be real, as students we can complain and complain and it seems like nothing ever changes because no body truly cares. As much as it is said the actions of those in power do not show it. School is supposed to be a safe space but in reality it is not. There are people who take everything that life gives them and use it as motivation and they thrive. Others are not there yet in life as students are children. The education we are gifted with is a blessing. However sometimes the people in the building are the issue. Going to school for 9 months carrying a child is very hard. Kids can be more brutal than adults. Having the ability to take your classes online at home will benefit so many children in the school system. Students taking classes online will be very beneficial. My overall reasoning behind this is a lot of the problems that students face is because of the students and the teachers in the building. Online education eliminated those factors. Students distractions will be limited. The environment will be safer. It is sometimes necessary for students to take online classes at home therefore it should always be an option. The big picture is to make our next leading generation more educated than the last. Whatever makes that easier should be employed into our school systems."
11802,0,"What if there was a way to tell teacher's if student's are sad, mad, happy by using a computer. Something that will tell teachers if that student is confused on what is being taught. Teens now of days hide their emotion's from parent's,teachers, friends, anybody that's close to them. You won't know how that child feel's. Holding their emotions in, can cause problems in the classroom. Student's will lose focus on what's going on the class, thinking about thing's on their mind's. The lastest software innovation from Prof. Huang can tell you if someone is mad, sad, or happy. All the computer need's is a 3-D computer model of that person face. Having this kind of technology to read expressions can be good in a classrooms. It'll tell teacher if that student is confused or bored. This type of technology will also tell if students are happy, mad, or sad. Teachers can confront students by asking if their okay, what part of the lesson in confusing to them. Using this techology more kids will get good grade, even more kids will gradute. Students will be able to get work done because of teacher asking if their okay or what they don't get about what's being taught."
25132,0,"Statistics show that 30% of people who ask for advice from more than one person end up making a smarter decision. Life is filled with decisions, some that may influence your whole life, and some that are not very important, that's why it's good to get some extra opinions. Many people have a hard time making decisions, and appreciate the extra help they get from their friends and peers. Having more than one person give you their advice on a matter could be all the help you need. It might also make you feel better about the decision you are taking. Asking your family and friends about a matter might also give you the answer you need. Gaining more opinions and voices if always better than not getting anything. Some problems you may encounter in life will lead to you making a very important decision, which might not be the easiest thing in the world. You make decisions every day of your life without even realizing it, such as choosing to eat breakfast or choosing to finish your homework. Those decisions might not require you to get more advice, because you are already so used to completing them each day. Studies show that as you grow up, you are faced with more important decisions, that might not only effect you. Like making a decision to move to Africa with your family, which in that case requires you to collect all the opinions of your family members, because the decision not only effects you, but your whole family also. Receiving more voices and advice on a matter might not only allow you to make a better decision, but also allow you to gain more knowledge on that subject, like a decision to go on the keto diet. Your friend might offer pros and cons to going on a keto diet, and why you might like it or hate. Each person has their own knowledge on a certain subject, like a doctor could offer you knowledge about health matters, or a lawyer could offer you knowledge about civil matters. If you had an important decision about your health, you might want to go to your doctor to get his advice on the matter, because he knows more about that topic. He also studied more about it and is more knowing. Coming to a conclusion on a decision might be the hardest thing you do in your life. It might make you feel depressed and down, like you can't even make a simple decision, and that's okay. That's why asking more people about it might make you feel better. An example is myself, when it comes to making choices I am the worst to come. I hate coming to conclusions, because I always feel that I made the wrong decision or didn't think enough about it, that's why I always ask my family members for advice before making a decision, it makes me feel more relaxed and happy about my choice. It also makes me feel like I got the knowledge I need I make the right decision. That's why asking more than one person, could lead to you feeling better and more relaxed, and you could finally get on with your life, knowing that you made the right choice. Last but not least friends and family know you the best. They know what you like, and they know your personality. They are the number one people who might offer you the best advice. An example is my friend Generic_Name, she once came and asked me if it would be good for her to take a year off of college, she wanted to relax and have a year to herself. I told her no. Why you might ask, because I knew my best friend and I knew that she would feel sad and depressed if she took a year off, because she's the kind of person who likes to work, she might feel overwhelmed at times, but overall she loves the thrill of getting a new assignment. So she took my advice and didn't get a year off. The next year she felt so much happier and thanked me a lot for giving her my advice. So in conclusion what I mean is that your friends and family in the end know you better than anyone else, that's why it's good to get their opinion on a matter, especially if it concerns your future. Trust me the advice they will give you will benefit you in life. I'm nearing the end of this essay, and I just want to say that no matter how hard you think about a decision. It's best if you get other people's opinion who might know more about that topic or subject. It's important that you find the right people to ask when looking for advice. If you are ever having trouble making a decision don't forget that your family and friends are always here to give you their opinion and advice on a matter, because that's what matters the most. Don't be too hasty when it comes to making a decision, remember ""slow and steady wins the race""."
7843,0,"Uuugh! Have you ever been forced to do an activity? Considering that i'm a student I know I have. Many kids don't do extracurricular activities because of technology. I dont blame the principal making students have to participate in these kind of stuff, it's healthy, but I disagree because it's too much stress, have things to do, school didn't have what some of us wanted. First, students don't do or play sports because of stress. This can be caused by having to be on time when it is hard to. Parents don't have time to take their son or daughter to practice due to their job, and when they arrive late the couch will be mad. Some don't finish their homework so it keeps piling up having to stay after with teachers to finish. Others have personal problems with family or friends, and are struggling to keep things together. Second, we have things to do. For example the parent is at work or the sibling can be sick and have to be cared of. Another is that 14+ year old have jobs after school and don't have the time to do the things they like. Even some can't stay after at all for the fact that they did something troublesome like vandalism, and now are on house arrest, but can still go to school to learn. Finally, The school didn't have what we wanted for a choice. Like skateboarding. Schools hate skateboarders, but as a after school choice like this kids with boards can practice some tricks and ride around a certain space. Video games can be healthy like Wii Sports. Wii Sports has a variety of games the kids can choose from and even go against each other. There are so many choices we students want to add, and I think it would be wonderful for principals to listen to these great ideas. In conclusion, I disagreed because it is too much stress for us, have other things to do, didn't have a subject some of us wanted. So principals please give us a choice of yes or no. We hate being forced into things we clearly don't want to do."
25493,0,"I personally think that going to more then one person to ask for advice is a great idea because you are getting different peoples perspective for more then one side. Also, if you only listen to one person that is giving you false information then that will cause you to believe in what ever they say even tho it could be wrong. Then that will led you to give false information then when someone finds out it wrong they will never believe you again. Not only is getting more then one opinion a good thing it gives you the right thought lets say you wanna play football and soccer but you only have time for one then you go ask your friend and your friend says you should play football. After,you still dont know what to do so you ask your other friend you friend says soccer so then you think. After, a couple of days you ask you friend that ask why did you say I should play football he says football is more manly and you need to be really good and have a lot of skill and need to be strong for football. Rather then soccer where you just kick a ball into a goal and over celebrate. Football use a bunch tackling and running,catching,throwing. You also have trow a perfect spiral or the team will intercept it or it will get swatted. On top of all that a wide receiver have to run a really complex route for the defender to get off of him and for him to catch it. afterwards, the quarter back has to avoid getting tackled and releases the ball before getting tackled from 3-4 linemen. Also,football is better to watch there are field goals,touchdowns,even two point plays which makes the game even more fun to watch. Football also has a super bowl after every season to determine who is to best in the league during the super bowl game theres is also a half time show where celebrities preform to sing and dance. So that is why I think you should play football and why I think football is better After,you hear your friend talk you go to your other friend and say the same thing why did you say I should play soccer?.He says because soccer is about teamwork and strategy like passing the pass to your teammate a certain way or direction so the defender doesnt get it,or you shoot it with more curve then power so the goalkeeper doesnt save it. Soccer is more complex then you think like goalkeepers. Goalkeepers are one of the hardest position to play if not the hardest its so skill based you need to know wen to dive or when to jump,or know if its going out,or curving in. Also, you need to work with you team or your not going to do so good. Soccer use a lot of running,stamina,and quick thinking. Like for example if there is a defender on you and you have the ball you need to figure out if our going to shoot, pass, or straight up just out run him. Also,defending is extremely hard to play and extremely important because if you dont have defense,or not good at defending they will simple just out run you,and score.Soccer also has a thing called Champions league where all the teams compete to see whos the best in the world. Do you get it now how soccer is based of skill and strategy,and not just kicking a ball in to a goal. After,all it not about what sport is better or what is more watched or liked better its about playing what you want to play,and how you want to play. you see this is why I think getting more then one opinion from two different people is important it can really help out the situation if you ask the right people they will lead you to the right decision this is also really important if your not sure what to do or just want to learn more about your decision before making it."
23907,0,"Are you battling something in life right now that you just can't attend school everyday or even attend it at all? Do the teachers in the classrooms move to fast for you to understand whats actually going on? Are you taking care of a sick or injured family member? These are some things that will take away the chances of students going to school everyday, but there benefits that will help kids that are having these sorts of problems in life. My first reason is having to take care of a sick or injured family member. In some families students that attend schools has to take care of someone thats sick or injured because that's who the sick or injured person only has in life. Some days the students are not going to be able to go to school because they have to watch after them, and some students can't even make it to school at all. I have a friend name Generic_Name, and she has a brother name Generic_Name that she takes care of everyday. She doesnt attend school at the moment because her brother is special needs, and he needs her help throughout the day while their parents are at work. Generic_Name makes sure her brother eats, takes his medicine when needed, and bathes every morning like he's supposes to. Generic_Name is not able to go to school like the rest of us, so she takes online classes instead to make things easier for her. It allows her to do the classes whenever she wants or needs to, so if she's busy at the moment helping her brother it won't affected her classes online. Even though Generic_Name doesnt attend school her dream is to graduate like the rest of us and get her diploma on time. Another reason is the students thats has cancer, a disease, or even on suicidal watch, and cant make it to school because their doctor tells them not to go or they can't go. If there wasn't a online or video conference to help these students out, they would've had to drop out of school until they've got better and sometimes they don't even get better. My sister has a friend name Generic_Name and she's suicidal. Generic_Name tried to kill herself four times because she couldn't take life for what it was anymore. She ended up having to stay in the hospital for months because of what she was trying to do to herself. Since Generic_Name couldnt go to school she started falling behind in all of her class assignments and started failing the classes too. The school brought across Generic_Name families attention that she could take the classes that she's falling behind on and failing online until the doctor says shes able to go back to school. While Generic_Name was in the hospital she took all her class on the computer, and even video conference with her teachers to get a better understanding of the assignments. When the doctor told Generic_Name that he feels thats shes ready to go back home and go to school, Generic_Name was passing her classes with A's and B's. Generic_Name ended up graduating High School because of the online and video conferencing with her teachers helping her get an advanced diploma. My final reason what if the teacher is moving to fast for the students to understand whats going on. Sometimes in class teachers move a lot faster than what students can understand. When teachers are moving faster it makes some students fall behind because they can't keep up with his or her pace. Taking the online class can help the students a lot more because they're going at they're own pace and actually understanding what they're doing. Theres a lot of people I know that takes online classes because it helps them out more than what the teachers can do for them in class. Letting them take the online classes help them pass the classes with A's and B's not C's or D's, and making them feel more strongly about the subject than before. Helping them push their GPA up way more than what it was before taking the online classes. Online and video conferencing can help a lot of kids in it's own ways that some people dont even know. Just think about how many people will get a chance to graduate, and get their diploma with using this method for more help in their classes. This is a different but smart technique that will help students in the future grow up with the help they need in life. Using this will flip student worlds upside down from the bad, and making it the best thing they ever did while they were in school. The online classes and video conference helped a lot of people, and can even help someone that you're close to in life thats going through personal problems."
12242,0,"What I would say to a person who thinks that the face on Mars was created by aliens is this, for one we have never found any living things besides bateria and organisims on another plant. The reason why I say this is because NASA has no proof besides what they think is a face created by aliens on Mars. I have watched many shows about space and other shows like Brian Games. Brian Games had a show about faces, and it said that you can see an object and make it look human or make it look like a face, such as a specific flower that might look like a face. This is what those scientists are doing in this very situation. They are mistaking a natural made land form on Mars as an alien build face. There are many ways this landform could have been made. It could have been made by wind and rocks blowing across what you could say is a landscape. As you can see from the landform is that it has faided away over time and now looks like a lump of sand, which wouldn't you think if aliens made that they would fix it up and make it look like a face again? So this is my argument on why I believe that this is just a natural made landform."
13318,0,"Dear readers, im here to tell you about the face on Mars. We were traveling up to Mars to get some cool pictures and we noticed that in one of the pictures was a misterious face! As soon as we saw it everyone directly assummed it was created by aliens. ""NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted ""huge rock formation... which rembles a human head. fprmed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" ""The ""Face on Mars"" has since become a pop icon."" When I first saw it i had no idea what the face was, i thought maybe it was just me that saw it or something. I would have never guessed that it would become so big to us. My friend Fred thinks that aliens did it, aliens arent real... are they? i mean ow could such a puniy creater make such a fuse over a interesting face. Aliens are not real!! When Fred was rantting about how it had to be an alien and nothing else could have made thoose faces i was thinking that he might have gone crazy. I mean it could have been alines but most likly not."
24782,0,"Advice is really something you shouldnt take. Advice can we great but the total opposite of what you wanted to hear. People often times give you bad advice as well, so you really should seek out more than one person an opinion on the topic at hand. Seeking multiple persons for advice can often lead you to an overlooked detail,or a different outcome of the situation. So say one of my friends decided to jump off of a cliff, but they want to know which cliff and how to safely do it. So I told them they shouldn't do it, but someone else told them a specific place and to bring a parachut. Then they ask another person and they also agree that they shouldn't jump off of a cliff. In that senario another person and me convinced my friend not to jump off of a cliff. I also managed to teach him the lesson on getting advice from multiple people, because the same guy who told him to jump off of a specific place with a parachut fell to his death because the parachut didn't catch the air and tangled. Another example of taking advice from oher people would be the,not so great, explorer Christopher Columbus. He took advice from probably over a thousand people not to set sail, because people knew that the earth was infact round and not flat. Everyone knew that the distance from India from Europe was over thousands of miles, but he didn't listen until the king and queen of Spain said okay on the explorers plans. He was a fool who couldn't do correct math and ended up discovering the Bahamas,and slautered every native on those islands. If he had just listened to the mass of people trying to stop him from sailing he wouldn't have ""discovered"" the Americas and slaughtered over 30 thousand people. I wanted to write a book about fantasy, but I lacked the creative fuction to put my story on the board. So I contacted my friends and strangers in the streets to ask what I should make my story about. Taking their advice I wrote a million dollar best seller that over took The Hobbit in popularity. All because I asked people what they would've wanted in a fantasy book. The opinions of others might even help me write a book, do something daring, or even just what movie to watch. That is the power of asking others for advice. Advice can often lead to dangerous situations and even not be that great. That is why I should always ask for a second opinion,and not just go off and do what one person told me. Weither it be an idea for how to start an essay or even what to eat tonight. Advice can be dangerous, but can be exactly what you wanted to hear or the opposite. The opinion of others can make me do wonders i never thought possible."

5660,0,"Hey,how are you today. Well I am here today to tell you why it would be a great idea for you to participate in the Seagoing program. The reason i think it would be a great idea for you to participate in the Seagong program is because I just got done reading a artical called,'' A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves,''.And in this story the author gave me many reasons on why it would be a great idea to participate in the program. The first reason on why it would be great is if u enjoy caring fo animals then the Seagoing Cowboys program is the place for you. The reason i say this is because the UNRRA hired''Seagoing Cowboys'' to take care of the horses,young cows,and mules that were shipped overseas. Another reason on why it would be a great idea is the experience to visit many unique places,for example if u like to travel and visit places you can have the side benefit of seeing Europe and China or even better you can see the special sight of the Acropolis in Greece. Also you can take a gondola ride in Venice,Italy,which is a city with streets of water. Another great thing about it is that you can tour a excavated castle in Crete and marvel at the Panama Canal on your way to China. But if your lazy and non disaplined i dont think this is a good trip for you because you have to be prepared for hard work. One other reason on why it would be a great idea is because if you like to have fun and enjoy yourself than this would be great for you because you can find time to have fun on board,especially on return trips after the animals have been unloaded. The cowboys play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling,and games also helped pass the time."

According to, ""34 Texting and Driving Statistics That Will Make You Put Your Phone Down"" Commit to driving safe, your text messages are important, but getting to your destination safely is even more important. Everyone should be safe when they are driving and laws are are being made to try to prevent this. In conclusion, nobody should not use their phone while driving because people on the road are at a risk. Everyone safety should be first not their phones. Drivers can get injured and it puts innocent people life at risk and could lose their life or can be crippled because a person was texting and driving at the same time. Texting and driving need to come to a stop so teens and adults don't die and not only is texting while behind the wheel bad enough itself it can cause serious damage to the driver and the passengers and the people surrounding you. Driver should know the position they putting themselves and others and they should never have their attention on their phone. They should keep their eyes on the road."
16734,0,"I feel like driverless cars are an okay idea because in the artical it says that Google has had these types of cars since 2009 and they have been driven half a million miles without a crash, even though they are not actually 100 percent driverless. A lot of manufacturers believe that it was not so much the car that needed to be ""smarter"" but the roads. The cars would have to use a whole lot of sensors to be able to be self driving, and it would cost alot of money to get new roads and everything that is needed for the cars. In cars today we have alot of sensors because they help with an abundance of things such as antilock brakes, automatic windows and many more. in the artical it says that BMW in 2013 announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant"". That means that the car could handle driving and functioning at speeds up to 25 miles per hour, as long as the driver had their hands on the wheel. Although the cars can steer, accelerate and break on their own the drivers are still notified when the road ahead requires human assistance. Many people can argue and say ""wont drivers get bored of waiting for their turn to drive?"" Although that is a concern the cars arent going to always be self driving, that can be changed with the push of a button or the flip of a switch. the driver can choose when he or she wants to drive and when they want the car to drive its self. In many states it has been lawed that the use or attempt to make such cars is illegal, but many manufacturers believe that whith in the next few years those laws will be changed, but if those are changed then new laws are going to have to be put in place. Those laws can help a company because the laws would either state that it was the drivers fault if they got hurt in the self driving car or if it was the manufacturers fault for making said car. Either way i believe that the making and use of driverless cars is a pretty good idea because now and days we live in a world where we have to be caught up with the latest and greatest things or we fall behind. The world of technology is evolving and so is human kind, so i believe that driverless cars will be a good addition to this ever changing world of technology."
16461,0,"See I was so excited for playing sports. My dream is to be one of the best basketball girl stars. I am really good in sports but I have a ""C"" average in school. Sadly we have to have a ""B"" average in school. To be honest if u have a ""C"" average you are still passing. So I really don't understand why you can't have a ""C"" average to play sports. Its not like were not trying our hardest. If we were not trying our hardest we would have D' s or F' s. No one isn't perfect after all. I really like sports and I dislike how we cant play no more if we make less then a B. Usually when kids can't play sports no more they stop trying to learn. They immediately give up on life. when you lower it down to a ""C"" average the sport players avoid trying to get D' s and F' s. But to some it's hard making a ""B"" average. I mostly guarantee If you change it to a ""C"" average more people would try to bring there D' s and F' s up. Because they could be able to believe in their self more of bringing their grade up to a ""C"" average. So why don't you give it a try"
8774,0,"In the article ""The Challenge of exploring Venus"" the author describes why humans should continue to explore Venus. The Author of the article makes several convincing claims throughout said article. One example is in paragraph four it states that long ago Venus was very Earth like in the fact that it was largly covered in ocean. As most of us have been taught that water is essential for all life to be able to survive. Venus also has many geological features similar to Earth in that it has valleys,mountains,and craters. These similarities make us curious and what to ask the question if Venus was so Earth like then did it ever contain living organisms? Also we must ask ourselves could it ever sustain life. Another factor that makes humanity so curious about Venus as it states in paragraph four as well that Venus is one of our nearest options for a planetary visit. Imagine looking up at clear stary night and along with the pale face of the moon and the twinkling of the stars. You would see a shining glow in the distance wondering what could it be what is going on there and can I visit it. For Venus it is entirely possible to do so. Though one might say that the author gave too many negative factors to visiting Venus. Yes he does but these are but challenges in the way of human curiosity. Yes the air might be ninety-seven percent carbon dioxide yes the surface might temperature might be eight hundred degrees. Can these challenges stand in the way of human injanuity and our will to discover the unkown. No nothing can stand in the way of human curiosity. For eaxample in Pragraph seven it states that NASA is working on other approaches such as simplified electronics made of silicon carbide. This invention has even been tested by the simulated chaos of Venus and it lasted for three weeks. Though we might not be ready yet for our long awaited visit to Venus it will adventualy be possible. I might not live to see it but in the wake of human curiosity and the will to discover the unkown nothing can stand in our way. Nothing will stop us from reaching for the stars."
6366,0,"Firstly, I disagree because some kids around here may not have the money to do a sport, when you do a sport you have to buy the pants,shoes,the shirt everything that goes with that sport you'll need to buy for the activity or sport. But I do recommend trying to find something to do out of school so your not In your house all day long,but do something that you don't have to pay for, for example help out with a church group or ask people to walk there dogs stuff like that. Anyways i disagree most families out here in the real world don't have much money to spend money on everything your going to need for that activity that your going to do,now if you talk to the school or a teacher an tell them that you really would like to try this sport or this activity maybe they'll help you out with paying for the things but most of the time schools aren't very good with helping you with things like that. Secondly, some kids may have to watch there brother or sister because there parents have to work or just maybe they only have one mom or just one dad. We never know what might happen if we leave them at their house by themselves. For example one time when I use to live In this big white house when I was younger my mom left to go work so I decide to go to a friends place that wasn't very far from my house so I left them there by themselves,my friend decide to pull up a stop sign but I wasn't involved someone saw her do it an called the cops on us,next thing you know the cops was there then I got in trouble because I've left my brother and sister at home with no one there to watch them. So thats why students should have a choice to not do a sport or a activity, so they don't have to leave their siblings at there house by themselves. finally, most kids like sports and doing fun activities but I've known some kids and people that don't like to do sports or fun activities. The reason Is I've seen kids get Into big fights over who's going to go first an this an that,thats part of the reason some kids don't get out much to do things but the other reason Is maybe they feel like they'll get judge by what they look like or how they dress trust me i understand that problem. The other thing is sometimes kids have to get a job to help pay bills and get food on the table because there mother Isn't making much money so they have to go get a job and help there mother with stuff they need. People all around the world have to do these things It's sad that they have to but they got to do what they have to do. So that Is why i disagree students should have a say In this to not just the principal."
2914,0,"Many people use cars to get around every day. It's become a common form of transportation and a way of life. But with this, there are also negative effects of having the widespread use of cars. It pollutes the earth with substances like smog and uses up more resources from the earth that it needs to, taking from the resources later generations may need. There are several benefits to reducing the use of cars, such as a cleaner and less polluted earth, and we as people will start to become smarter about our resources. There are several countries where smog is a serious issue, making it warmer than it should be and dimming the area. not only this, it destroys the Earth's atmosphere. There are cities where they hold days where nothing but public transportation is allowed, and people who violate will be fined. Days like these decrease pollution and create a better environment for ours and other generations to come. If cities all around the world took stands such as this and began to have multiple days of no cars or even ban them, the world may become a cleaner and less polluted place, and the atmosphere may not be destoyed as easily. What it seems, is that all it really takes is just some effort from us to make the world a better place. With the banning of car use comes the knowledge of how much of our resources we have wasted on them. We may start to realize what we have done to the earth, and in turn, ourselves. It is an extreme pollution to the earth, destroying the atmosphere and depleting the metals and materials used to make and drive these cars. With the reduction of the use of cars comes the fact that we will no longer destroy the earth with gasoline and diesel fuel, but instead try to keeo if clean and preserve what we still have left. So, if we try to reduce the usage of cars worldwide, we will stop the massive polution we have created and will gain the knowledge of what we have done, instead of living in blissful ignorance. There is something we can learn with this. Without cars, smog would almost not be caused by us, and we as a race will no longer destroy our home."

Distracted driving has become dangerous practice on our roads and highways. If you need a reason to stop texting and driving you shouldn't be driving in the first place. first of all it illegal to do and its very dangerous you could hit another car or hit someone in the road. Some more reason are consider the people you have in the car when you text and drive you are also putting the passengers at risk when you do so. Another one is think about other people driving. you could hit a family driving home and kill all of them if you text and drive. Think about the consequences next time you think about picking up your phone while driving. Somethings you can do if a text is really that important you can pull over and then send the text. Although many cars and trucks today now have buttons on the steering wheel where you can press one button to pick up a call or to text someone back. If you drive older model cars you should maybe invest in a new car or even a more hands free phone. There are about 3,477 people who died from texting and driving back in 2015. Just be careful on what your doing while driving make sure you keep your eyes on the road at all times. Next time you go out on the road think about what could happen if you look at your phone while driving. Keep in mind that there are other peoples lives a stake when your driving distracted. Also keep in mind the people in your car when you have the urge to pick up your phone.

13328,0,"Some people choose to say that the Face was created by aliens, but I am here to tell you that it definetly is not an alien structure, simply a natural landform. In 1976 I must say, it certainley did resemble a man made face. Though now that we have a clearer picture from 2001 it is very obviously just a natural landform. It resembles landforms similiar to the ones around the Amercian West. It is really just the Martian equivilent to those particular landfoms. The two are so similar in formation and shape. The most recent picture is so clear and high definition that even if it werre some kind of shack or Egyptian pyramid, you would know it for a fact. The picture taken in 1998 was on a slightly cloudy day, so I understand the doubt from some of you. Though we did take another picture, and it was on a very clear summer day, and it is mothing but a simple lava dome, that has taken the form of an isolated mesa about the same height os the Face on Mars. It was very hard work just to try and get that picture, and I would like to assure you that it is definetly no ""Martian Made"" structure. We got very close on a very clear day, and you can definelty see that those were just shadows, and nothing short of a dissapointment. What you don't understand is, that it would benifit us if it was a Martian's craft. It would give the tax payers evidence and reason to support us and give us their money to support the cause. SO therefore I rest my case tht clearly we are not lying because it would benifit us if there were Aliens crafting these thing, but the simple fact is, there isn't."
19997,0,"Dear Senator, The electoral college is a process that the founding fathers extablished as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and popular vote of the people. This process involves selecting the electors, meeting with the electors, and counting the votes by congress. There are 538 electors total in the Electoral College. The presidential election happens every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. After the election the governor makes a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" which has all the names of the candidates who ran for President. I believe we should keep the Electoral College because there is a certainty of outcome, it helps avoid run-off elections, and the electoral college helps balance out the smaller and bigger states with more people that vote. The outcome of an Electoral College has a possibility of creating a dispute like in 2000, but this dispute is less likely to happen over a dispute over the popoular vote. This is because the winning candidates share of the Electoral College is greater than his share of the popular vote. Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote in comparison to the 51.3 percent of popular votes for him and Mitt Romney. Trans-regional appeal is required in the Electoral College. If we got rid of the Electoral College then there would be a greater possibility of dispute. Furthermore, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes while winning a majority in the Electoral College. This proves that the Electoral college avoids the problems of elections in which neither candidate receives a majority of the votes. When no candidate wins a majority the pressure complicates the presidential election process. The Electoral College minimized this pressure be invariably producing a clear winner every time. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. In addition, a large state gets more attention from candidates than a small sate in a campaign. As an example in 2012 Obama, got 29 electoral votes. In Wyoming the winner only had 2 electoral votes in the same marin as Obama. The Electoral College provides some kind of restoration for the weight in the political balance that large states lose by mal-apportionment of the Senate. Voters in toss-up states are more likely to read into and pay more attention to a campaign because they know they are going to decide the election. It is most likely that these people are going to the the most thoughtful voters. To conclude, there are many reasons to keep the Electoral College. This process has made the winner of the election much clearer to decide. There are a lot of pros and cons to the Electoral College but the list of cons is way shorter than the list of all the pros to the Electoral College. We should keep the Electoral College because it creates a certainty of outcome, diminishes run-off elections, and creates a balance for the bigger states. The Electoral College has created a positive impact for our presidential election. Sincerely, PROPER_NAME"
9582,0,"This essay will include the reasons why people need to challenge exploring Venus. The text states that it will be good to meet the very edges of imagination and invoation to find out if Venus is really real. The author also says that people should be brave to explore on pass the earth and be more open to it. Venus would be dangerous to explore, because of it 97% carbon dioxcide. They say that the tempperatures average above 800 degrees on Venus. The pressure is 90 times greater tha what we experience on our planet earth. NASA states that they want to send our human kind to study the planet Venus. There will be like 30 blimp-like vehicles hovering around the planet Venus. The tempertureswill still be toasty at around 170 degrees fahernheit. NASA is working on other approches right now to explore Venus. These are some of the ways that they are going to try and learn moe about Venus and other planets."
753,0,"Cell Phones We humans have are cell phones on the daily even in a car while driving. I feel like we should not have are cell phones while driving because it increases the risk of you crashing, puts the people around you in danger and it makes your reaction time slower. Driving with a cell phone in your hand increases the risk of you having a car accident. In 2015, six hundred and sixty thousand drivers in the United States were estimated to use cell phones each day while driving behind the wheel during daylight hours. Drivers who text while behind the wheel, are twenty-three times more likely to have an automobile crash. The yearly car accidents that happen every year is 1.6 million cars a year. Not only does texting and driving puts your own life at risk, but it also gravely endangers the lives of other people around you. As a driver, you are responsible not only for the passengers in your car, but also for other motorists on the road, not to mention pedestrians who often end up hurt or killed because of the negligence of drivers. Using your cell phone while driving dramatically slows down your reaction time. Shown in a study texting while driving delays reaction times by 37%, while drinking to the legal limit delays reaction times by 13%. Making driving with a cell phone more dangerous than driving under the influence of alcohol. In conclusion driving with a cell phone is a really bad idea it increases the chance of you crashing, putting others around you in danger and slows your reaction time."
21141,0,"Dear principle, Cell phone use during school has always been a popular subject. Many students would say that being able to use their phones during school is a good idea, but a good amount of teachers and staff would say different. This dispute has been going on recently and I personally think cell phones should be allowed during school, But on conditions. Classes should be for class work only. There should be no distractions in class, many people would agree with that. Students are in school, not only to meet new people and socialize, but mainly to learn. I do not think cell phones should be allowed to be used during class time. Using a cell phone during class would take away the interest to listen to the teacher and learn. All students would be worried about would be texting, when they should concentrate on the lesson. Therefore cell phones should not be allowed in class. On the other hand, lunch/recess is supositly students free time. I see no problem with the privilege of using cell phones during lunch. Even the use during other free times in the school day would be completely fine and harmless. During this free time children are not required to learn or do any work. Cell phones would obviously not be a problem if there is nothing kids should be paying attention to. Finally if lunch and other free times are for socializing, why not let children bring and use their phones during that time. Once students lunches were over, they should be made to either turn off their phone or put it back in their locker. If students did not do that they should be punished and there should be consequence's for not listening to their teachers. Students usually have to bring their phones to school. Mainly for after school activities. Usually children have to find a ride home or consult a parent on how they would get home from the school. It would not be fair to tell them that they cant bring them at all. In conclusion, students should be able to use their cell phones, only during lunch or free time. Students would be happy and possibly more willing to learn. Teachers also would be happy because they would be made to shut their phones off during class. This would be a great choice and improvement to the school rules."
14741,0,"Dear principal, I think that student should be required to take part in community service because there are many benefits that can come from helping others. One of which can be learning a new skill or ability. One example could be if you are performing a service in an office like building you can learn the skills to be a good secretary. Also if you are performing an activity that requires a great amount of work such as delivering heavy packages you could improve your motor skills and become stronger an more fit. Another benefit that could come from community service could be improving your reputation around your community. If people that don't really know you see you helping others they may want to get to know you and might become friends with you. Performing community service can also make you a much better person. By this I mean that community service could teach you that there is much more you can do with your time after school than going onto Facebook, Aim, playing video games, and watching television. My last example is that community service could also improve the ability of a student to work together with others. If there are a group of people performing community service with each other the service could teach them to work as a team and to help each other out. In conclusion I think that community service should be mandatory in school. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME"
22724,0,"Kids are always out playing in the snow on snow day; it is one of the most exciting things when they see the message ""No school tomorrow, closed for snow"". On snow days, kids go out with their friends, play all day, and enjoy their evening with a nice warm mug of hot chocolate with no worries about school. If kids did home school or online school there would no longer be that excitement about snow days and there would be no more snow days. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home because they think it benefits the students, but actually it would not benefit students to attend classes at home because they would not get taught anything, kids would not have any friends, and students would not be prepared for the real world. Students attending class at home would not benefit them at all because they would never get taught anything. When taking online school kids can easily cheat and look up the answers to the questions being asked. This means students are learning how to cheat and care more about making a good grade than learning the topic. If the students are not getting taught the subject that means the students are not learning anything except bad habits, which will not benefit them later on. If students attend their classes at home then it would not benefit them because they would not have any friends. The students would have no friends because they are at home all day, alone, doing school by themselves. School is about learning and having fun, and if students have no friends, then they are going to miss out on the fun parts of school and end up hating school because they believe it is boring. Another thing that can and will happen if kids have no friends is cause social issues in the future because they are not going to know how to act around other people, since they did school at home. Schools offering distance learning as an option is not beneficial to students because it is not how the real world is going to be. Some people think that online school is helpful because it is a different style, but they are wrong because it does not teach them what the real world is going to be like. The real world is working with people, asking questions, and working through problems. If kids think that it is normal to isolate themselves from everyone to do mandatory work then they are not going to know how to ask questions when they need help or how to communicate with people when there is a problem. Also, if kids depend on the internet to look up answers to questions they should have learned in school, then they are not going to know what to do in their job. Schools offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home is not beneficial at all because kids would not learn any of the material. Kids would also not have any friends, but would have social issues if they took home school. Lastly, if kids took online school then they would not know how the real world works because the only thing students would know how to do is isolate themselves and look up answers on the internet. School in school buildings are important because it teaches students multiple subjects, how to have fun, and how the real wold works by letting them communicate and ask questions."
23824,0,"Some schools have begun to allow students to learn from home using videos and online conferencing. While this may seem like a good way to get more students to attend school more frequently, it will actually have the opposite effect in the long run. Students will not benefit from this new form of classes because they will be encouraged to miss school more often, be easily distracted, and the classes will not be as effective. With the ability to take classes outside of school, there will be less incentive for students to attend school. This will not only hurt them in their academics but also in their social lives. Student attending classes at home will not attend school events or interact with their peers as much as students who attend school in a more traditional manner. Many students only interact with their friends in school; so if they are not attending school they will not interact with their friends. The lower attendance will also hurt the school because less students will attend school spirit events or fundraisers. The availability of online classes could also hurt the students attending regular school because of the diminishing school community. Not to mention that students taking classes at home will not receive the same quality of education as those taking classes in school. Online classes are not as engaging for students, who can be easily distracted. Watching videos online is not very interesting, especially if they are school related. Very few students find learning fun and interesting. The majority of students who do not will not find watching school videos very enthralling. Without a teacher present students will be easily lose focus and not pay attention to the instructional videos. One of the classes I am currently taking is doing a 'flipped classroom' structure; meaning we watch videos of lessons at home and do practice similar to homework in school. While watching these lesson videos I often find myself distracted and having to rewind parts of the video. It is easy to imagine a less dedicated student simply missing parts of the videos and not bothering to rewind. This tendency has strong potential to hurt students who are easily distracted or not strongly invested in their learning. Learning from a video is not as interactive as doing the same in a classroom with a teacher present. Many students learn in different ways; a fact that would be hard for a teacher to accommodate for over a video conference. The video conferencing would also make it difficult for teachers to interact directly with their students by offering feedback for their work and answering questions. Activities done in the classroom in which students interact with the material that they are learning are integral for students to effectively learn said material. In the summer after eighth grade, I took Geometry online from home. The class consisted of videos and small projects followed by online quizzes. Despite getting a very good grade in the class, I retained almost none of the information I learned. To this day, I often struggle in my math classes when we learn information that builds on what we were supposed to learn in Geometry. The online class lacked the flair that a real teacher would have added to the class that was necessary for me learning the information in a meaningful way. Students taking online classes would face very similar challenges to the ones I did, greatly diminishing the meaningfulness of the classes. The concept of online classes seems great on the surface but comes with unforeseen issues that can dramatically affect students' quality of education. The fallibility of students' dedication to learning is often something that is not taken into account, even though it is something that is easily predictable. Student will always try to get out of going to school, want to do anything but watch a long, monotonous video, and need teachers to make learning interesting. For these reasons, online classes will never be as effective as traditional, in-class learning."
17712,0,"The driverless cars would be something people would like to have but they may not be very safe. There is the same amount of negative aspects as well as positive aspects of the cars. I am mostly against the the development of the driverless cars. The cars have sensors to alert the drivers if they are heading towards something dangerous or the car deal with the circumstance they're in. The cars have gone miles without crashing but still need a driver. What if the car is in traffic issues where the driver needs to be in control and the sensor is broke and can't alert the driver? The driver could stop paying attention for one second and the car could wreck. The sensors could also malfunction and run into something when it was supposed to brake. The car also vibrates and has flashing lights to warn the driver. The vibration and lights could become dull and the driver may not notice them. The driver could then wreck or get hurt because he or she didn't know they were supposed to drive or not. There are not laws to protect someone if there is an accident. The car could fail and no one would know who to blame. It is illegal to drive these cars in most states because they're not fully safe. What if someone thinks they're safe and the laws pass to where people can drive them but they malfunction? Who would get in trouble? The driver or the manufacturer? Even though they could be safer than a person driving, the car is still not completely safe. There are good qualities of the car like the warning signs and the entertainment while people aren't driving but those could break. The technology of the car could fail and hurt someone or multiple people. Some could think that the car is durable but they would still need to take precautions."
18141,0,"What would happen if someone was in a driverless car and it got into an accident and the person got hurt? If the person was driving they may have been able to prevent the accident and avoided getting hurt. Because of these possible accidents and mistakes that the driverless cars could make it is not a good idea to have them. Yes, there are times when they would come in handy. Say someone woke up late and did not have time to get ready. If there were driverless cars that person could get ready while the car was driving itself. Although times like these may come in handy it is still not a good idea to have them around. In the reading it says that sometimes the car gets into situations when it does not know what to do, such as traffic and construction zones. If this were to happen the person would need to take control of the car and go along as if it was not even a driverless car. This seems to defeat the whole purpose of having a driverless car. So why have them when in reality it is not completely a driverless car. There will never be a time when we can fully rely on the safety of a driverless car. Yes, they may know the rules of the road, but they do not know what to do in all situations. Because people cannot fully rely on these cars, it will cause them to worry, and will constantly be looking at the road and what is going on becuase they do not know if the car will know what to do. This situation also defeats the purpose of having a driverless car because it will be like they are driving, but with more anxiety. Due to all of these reasons for possible crashes and causing stress and anxiety to the passengers it is not a good idea to have driverless cars around. Even though at times they might come in handy, there is always a downside that goes along with that. In this case there are just to many downsides to make it worth the time of fixing and improving the driverless cars to run properly."
10329,0,"The use of Facial Action Coding System could be a good thing to use in school. It also can be used for help better how teacher do things. At can also help a pyschologist find students with problems or mental issues. Another good use for it is could help the students in there ability to act in acting classes. First reason why it could be a good thing for schools is that you can use the system to check if the students are bored or confused, so you can change how a teacher teaches in a different style. It also could change how the students learn. In the text I says this '' Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'' It would be good to use to help students learn what are some of facial expression and learning what muscle cause that movement. Another reason why it would be good to use the system is to use in acting class. A lot of school have classes such as acting, drama, and threater. How this would benfit a student is it would help then try to get the facial expression that they would need for a certain part in acting or in play it also and help produce emotions. In paragraph 9 it says this '' according to the facial feedback theory emotion, moving your facial muscles not only express emotion but it aslo may even help produce them.'' Then it goes on to say ''constantin stanislavsky, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way to createing these emtions on stage''. Finally another reason why it would be good to use the facial coding system is it would help the school psychologists if there is a student is having problems and they are hiding their problems. If would help alert the pyschologist if they are going threw depression or suicidal thoughts. it would help the pyschologist so they find a way to make them happy so they do good in school and keep track of what they are doing. In paragraph 5 it says this '' you van probably tell how a friend is felling simply by the look on her face. Of course most of us would have trouble describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried etc.'' So with conclusion these are some the reason why it would be good to use Facial Action Coding System. It would be for schools to think about these option and what it can do for students. Thank you for your taking your time to read this."
9872,0,"The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable beacuse i don't think the technology can tell how someone is feelings 100 percent correct. Technology can't read humans minds nor humans face so i think the use of this technology is not valuable to read the emotional expressions of students. It won't be good for some people who want a private life feelings if the technology is showing how they feel every time they get happy or sad. Technology are always not smart,technology can hurt humans too they're not always helpful. Just because you enjoy using it does'nt mean others do. I think that this technology to read emotional expressions of humans is bad to use well it's my oppion i don't know about others people but im pretty sure they'll agree with me. What if this technology brng harm to some people,its not a good idea to read people feelings some might like it but some might hate you. So i don't think this technology is valuable. It might be helpful to read students's emotional expressions but what if the students dont want that like they want they private feelings,they don't want to share with anyone only themself or maybe friends. Who want someone to going around and use technology to see what they feelings? Nobody."
19065,0,"I think government should change electoral voting to voting by popular vote. Americas government say every citizens vote counts but they are really only counting the electoral votes. Their was an incident in 2000 called ""The disaster factor"" according to source 2, this crisis let electors defy the will of the people. Some electors called ""faithless electors"" refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for who ever they want. If we have electoral votes we might as well not have popular votes. People spend there time going to vote for the president they feel is better for this country yet, when they get home and watch the polls they realize the only votes they are counting are electoral. Growing up i was taught that every vote counts be voting just to vote for electorals just so they can vote for our president doesn't seem like im voting for myself it seem like they are voting for us. In source 3 their counter-claim is that we should keep our electoral colleges, they also say ""it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors."" basically telling on themselves by saying our votes don't matter or count. In source 2 they say ""the electorsl colleg is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they have no chance of winning"" the electoral college isn't fair at all, if it was based off popular votes, candidates will have what it takes to win in any state they want. In conclusion, in my opinion government should remove the electoral college, It is not a fair system to U.S. citizens every citizens vote should count so it should be abolished."
10383,0,"Technology can be beneficial in several aspects of everyday life, but reading emotions should not be one of them. According to the article, the technology to read human emotions is possible and can be effiecently used to detect how a person is feeling. This technology is certainly impressive but does not seem very beneficial to the average student and can be seen as slightly intrusive. Therefore, this technology would not be valuable in a classroom due to the small amount of benefit that it would provide and its intrusiveness, as students should have a right to keep certain emotions and feelings to themselves. It seems unnecessary to use this technology when emotions are already fairly easy to identify without the use of a computer. Body language and facial expressions can already easily be analyzed by humans themselves to reveal emotions. To quote the writer of the article, ""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face"" (D'Alto 5). This depicts that technology is not required to identify the basic emotions of a human being and is therefore unnecessary. If a person is not blatantly showing his emotions with body language and facial expressions, then the person wold likely prefer not to express what he is feeling or thinking. All human beings have a natural right to keep their thoughts and emotions to themselves as they please, and technology that can reveal emotions at their deepest depths can be intrusive. An example of this can be how computers use cookies to track what people are searching on the Internet in order to produce advertisements directed toward the user later on, which often disturbs people and makes them feel uncomfortable. This may be the same situation if computers have access to human emotions. The private feelings of a human should not be exploited by a computer, and therefore trespasses a basic right of humans which allows them to have their own private thoughts and emotions. The final reason that this technology would not be valuable is because there are little uses for it. Detecting emotions are not really relevant when using a computer. The author of the article states many examples of how this technology can be used on a computer, and the use of using the emotions to determine the type of advertisements would match emotions and what the user is feeling does not seem very important or beneficial. Overall, the implementation of technology into a student's everyday life would not be useful, therefore making it seem pointless rather than valuable. Therefore, the idea of implementing technology that read emotions would not be valuable in a typical classroom. Despite the consistency of the technology working successful, it would be worthless to bring into everyday lives as people do not need advanced computers to identify other people's emotions. The technology would also be extremely intrusive, as it would exploit the private thoughts and emotions of people that would not want their emotions to be detected and make them feel slightly uncomfortable. Alongside these reasons, there is practically no use for this advanced technology in a typical day of an ordinary student. For these reasons, while the concept of reading emotions may be interesting, there is not much benefit that will come from the use of this technology and therefore implementing it into classrooms would be a prodigious waste of money and effort in order to provide a minimal benefit for students."
13709,0,"Dear Principal, Community service is a praiseworthy act of kindness. Some people will do it the pure benefit of the community, while others have dissimilar opinions. That's why it is vital to have children make this decision for themselves. Forcing children in your school to do this task is disastrous. Most students have many extra-curricular activities that they participate in daily. Adding the community service policy would obliterate them of their precious time, that is already so rare. Trying to juggle soccer, homework, and friends is already a great amount. Adding this community service act is adding fuel to the fire. It pushes kids to go beyond their capacity of balancing life. By doing this homework won't get done, and therefore education is being deprived. Research shows that 47% of children across America are silently struggling with school and life in general. These studies conducted that having more free time to wind down after a days work relieves 89% of stress. With these astounding numbers, how could you afford to put their health and well-being in jeopardy? So much pressure is already on children these days; why add more? Have you ever thought about the possibility of students not taking the whole ordeal seriously? Its an almost sure product. It only takes one child to make a day of charity, a day of regret. When children slack off, is community service really getting done? If so, does it have the right intentions behind it? If not the excursion would be a waste of time for the children and the community. No one these days has time to waste. One might argue that doing the community service would be a great learning experience that teaches of moral and ethical values. But, at school level ages, children cannot recognize these aspects of life or appreciate them. The community would be given false hope of the children picking up trash, or visiting the elderly with no good intentions or understanding of what they are doing. Let someone who will get joy and self satisfaction do the job. Everyone wins! While making your decision remember that these kids lives are in your hands. Your decision has multiple outcomes. To make the right one, pick up a pen and write a letter to the community saying that children are not ready to be forced into these duty's. The children, citizens and most of all the community will greatly benefit your decisions. Sincerely, Caring Citizen."
16473,0,"Dear TEACHER_NAME, Have you ever not studied so you could prepare for a big game? Statistics say, 1/3 kids decide to practice their sport instead of study for a big test. That is why I think you should have a B average to be able to be on a team. When you have a B average that means you can manage studying and being on a team at the same time. Sometimes when you focus on something other than school it can distract you from what is really important. Also, if you set the average to B that is setting a goal for the students; to have good grades so they can play on whatever team they would like. Many students at our school play on a team; almost half of our students average at a C or below. If every student had to average a B to play on a team, you would see almost half of the students grades go up. Just so they could play on their team. That would mean half of the students grades would be raising. Raising the average would help about every student focus more on school. You would see improvement in a lot of students. When they focus, they do better, when they do better they are improving, and when they improve they can play on teams. Which is making the students able to manage school and teams. This would make the entire school improve. Over half of the schoool would raise their grade point average because, they are trying harder so they can play on the team. The teams would also grow stronger because, the students would start learning how to manage their time. For example, from 3-4:30 i will study for my test and 4:30-6 i will practice soccer. This one choice will change our entire school. Our school will grow stronger and better by getting each to have the average B to play on a team. better teams, smarter students, higher grade point averages, and a better school over all. please, put my opinion in mind."

Most of my friends today were formed through extracurricular activities. You may be loosing the opportunity for so many new friends by not participating in these activities. There is a whole world of fellow students waiting to meet you, these activities will expose you to them. Many of these activities will improve your education while having fun. Math club and Science Olympiad are great examples of this. These activities are less stressful than regular classes, but can help you to fully understand your topics. Virginia Readers Choice was a activity that most elementary schools participated in. V.R.C. helped my reading speed and comprehension, but was fun at the same time. To this day I still go back to read V.R.C. books. Extracurricular activities can improve your learning experience forever. Some extracurricular activities can boost your physical and mental health. By participating in these you will always come home happier and healthier. Most sports will teach you important life skills and qualities while getting you in great shape.

3444,0,"Summer projects are beneficial for learning. Students should design their own projects over the summer because they have time, can work with friends, and are educated about the subject. Some state that teachers should design the project because they have more experience and better planning, but this is false. Although some may disagree, students should design their own projects over the summer. There are many reasons why this decisions should be made. Students manage their time in the summer differently making the designing process easier. They can use information they've learned previously in the school year when designing the project, helping the students gain time management skills. They can also choose their own topic allowing them to be informed of what they're designing. When a student picks a topic they enjoy, the final product will display a large amount of effort and dedication There are further reasons why students should be able to design their own projects. Students get help from their friends who generate ideas for the students designing the project. Friends also help better the bonds they from with the students while spending time designing the project. Students can get help from their family member who help educate them, teach them new tactics, and purchase necessary materials required that the students cant afford. Lastly, students can go online to locate sources they can use to gather information while designing; furthermore, the students can locate articles provided by verified authors. When students design their own project, they are in control. They gain skills through designing with the help from friends, family, and the internet. Students who design their own project gain skills they will forever use."

Maybe kids are struggling because they don't get the material. they might need a tutor to help with that subject, because maybe sports are there lives like it is for me, it probably keeps them out of trouble, and if they cant get an B average they wont be able to play sports so they'll get trouble. keeping it at a c average will help them stay in sports. For me sports help me a lot it pushes me to get good greads to stay in sports and it keeps me out of trouble because I am so caught up in school and in sports that i will have no time to get my self in to trouble, but maybe for other students it isn't like that they probably don't get the material and just need a little more help like a touter, an easier class or just need the material to be explained a little more maybe they just need a little extra help. i think if u keep the C average it would be easier for the kids who love sports but need help in school to stay in sports and its not cool to not be able to stay in sports because they don't get the material, that's how it was for me in 7th gread i got below a c average and couldn't play sports. That was not fun, not one bit. the students at our school just need a little more help to keep their grade average at a c average and if you don't see any improvement in the students greads at our school then maybe you might have to enforce that rule. maybe that will push the subnets to work harder to get their greads up to stay in sports if they really want to be in sports, and that's how i see this we just need a little more help that's it. sincerely, STUDENT_NAME"
10625,0,"Schools are full of kids getting their education. Not all of these kids actually care about learning though. Many are only there because they have to be. A new technology called Facial Action Coding System could help lessen the negative attitudes of these types of students. We have the technology to find out how a student feels about the lessons they're receiving. We can figure out what types of lessons interest students the most. This wouldn't fix everything or be the best method for every student but it would definitely be valuable to have this kind of technology. Every teacher has their own method of teaching and every student learns differently from one another. This shouldn't be changed. However, we can make the students more engaged and interested in their education. This won't work for every student, but it can help with many. Facial Action Coding System is a new software that reads the muscles of the human face to figure out what a person is feeling. This could detect what interests, bores, upsets, and delights students. This would allow the computer to help the teacher to plan lessons that have the most positive effect on the students. The software reads the muscles on the face and uses that to detects what they like or don't like. The software could then alter the lesson plan to make it so that it is in a way that the students would most benefit from. Not every single student will have the same opinion as another or take out the same amount of information from a lesson as another, but this could definitely help teachers to see what works for certain students. Facial Action Coding System could be a very valuable technology for educating the youth. We have the technology to figure out what does and doesn't work when trying to teach students. Some students wouldn't benefit from the same things as others but this could still be very valuable to the teacher to see what students benefit from a certain type of lesson. This could help many dissengaged students to find interest in their education instead of dozing off in class."

But it can also be pretty nerve wrecking knowing you have to walk everywhere you want to go. But the more walking you do, the less money your spending. Having no worries about paying for gas, car notes, tickets, etc. Another good thing about not having a car is staying in shape. Walking around to get to where you need to go would get you more than plenty excerise. Nothing like having a nice healthy body, burning calories, and even pounds. Having nice strong and healthy heart and burning off the fat that you put on by doing nothing and being physically active by walking. Less accidents, car jams, traffic problems, and even car polution. What parent doesn't want a cleaner air for there children to breathe? Less cars can somehow lead to an safer enviornment. Less car accidents dealing with people texting and driving, which could lead to less possiblities of death maybe. No one wants to walk everywhere their trying to go, nothing wrong with going for a nice bike ride there. Limiting car usage can maybe differ the world, cause less problems, less worries, and the best of all... SAVE MORE MONEY!"
11633,0,"This article talks about ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"". In this article we learn about a machine that can that detects or identifies your emotions, whether sad, happy, angry, confused, or surprised this machine does it all. This machine found out that she was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. This software is the latest innovation from Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam. This software actually calculates peoples emotions like a math homework. The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles, Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit"". Dr. Huang observes that facial expression for each emotions are universal even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression. Using video imagery, the new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighting he different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions as in da Vinci's masterpiece. In fact, we human perform this same impressive calculation everyday. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried and so on. Yet Dr huang obsereves that artists such as Da vinvi studied human anatomy to help paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anaomical information as electronic code. I think this machine could be very useful in different situations like in offices, classrooms and even in personal homes. I would like it in classroom because it could tell whether students have a problem with something. I think this software could be a great thing for a classroom. Imagine a classroom computer that knows when you are happy or sad. For exapmle, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen a similar ad might follow it. But if you frown, the next ad will be something different. A classroom computer could recognize when a student s becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify a lesson, like an effective human instructor. The same technology can make computer animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. I think if a computer is able to do this it will make boring or less interesting classes more interactive, fun and understandable which makes students more willing to learn and will understands things better. I think this new upcoming software will help make class more interesting and fun for students because if this software can read someone's emotions it wil surely know when a students is getting bored or if a student is confused. I think the will make students learn more."
13864,0,"Dear TEACHER_NAME: Some of my friends perform community service, for example, some tutor elementary school children and others clean up litter. I do not think we should have to do this unless we wanted to. For example, there are many things that some kids might have to do at home. There could be: homework, chores, or even babysitting. This could take a while and put stress on us if we had to do community service. We have things that we need to do, and we want to do. Therefore, I do not think we should be required to do any kind of community service unless we volunteered. An example of myself not having time is: I have to wash my dogs every afternoon, I have to do many chores, and babysit my younger sister until my parents get off of work, I have to do my homework, and take a shower. Some things that I would like to do is: watch TV, listen to music, go walking, or ride bicycles. If I had to perform community service every afternoon, or even once or twice a week, I would have no time to do what I want and need to do. For example, I go to school everyday. I get out of school, and ride the bus home and get home at 3:30 P.M. every afternoon. My father doesn't get off of work until 7:00 P.M., and my mother doesn't get off until 7:30 or 8:00 P.M.I have a younger sister, that's five years old in preschool. She has to be with me at all times until my parents get off of work. I couldn't carry her with me to do community service because she's young and she gets into everything. Another example is: washing all three of my dogs every afternoon. That probably takes about an hour or an hour and a half. Homework usually takes about an hour, and taking out the garbage, washing dishes, cleaning my room, sweeping the house, watering and feeding the dog, cleaning my bunny cage, mopping and dusting usually takes probably about another two hours. I would like to be able to do all of that, and watch TV and ride bicycles or something everyday. This would take up most of my time. Please consider about thinking of all of this and realizing not all children have time to do this, and most of us don't want to do this either. Thank you. Yours Truly, STUDENT_NAME"
1078,0,"Phones and Driving Many people use their phones while they are driving. About 390,000 injuries happen each month due to someone distracted by their phone. Using a phone while driving is dangerous, and it needs to stop. Two ways that we can stop this are having the laws against phones and driving more heavily enforced and developing a hands-free software for all phones. Even though there are already laws against using your phone while driving, they should be more heavily enforced. Law breakers should have to pay a fine for putting other drivers' lives in danger. If it is still done after they are fined, they should face jail time. For the third offence, they should lose their licenses. That will be an effective way to stop some drivers from losing their attention to the road by using their phones. More hands-free software should be added to phones. The hands-free software should be mandatory to have on every phone. They should have it where you can answer calls and reply to text messages with your voice to minimize concentration loss from the road. It would be a great idea to make it mandatory to add a hands-free software to each phone before they go on the market shelves. In conclusion, ways to stop phones and driving are having the laws against phones and driving more heavily enforced and developing a hands-free software for all phones. If these actions are carried out proficiently, up to 421,000 incidents related to phones and driving could be prevented each year. [Last Name] 4 [Last Name] 1"
23129,0,"Students are exhausted. Sitting in a classroom for seven hours a day is tiresome and inhibits the learning of many. However, technological advancements may have a solution. Online learning, such as online lectures and video classes, have replaced the traditional classroom in many settings, though with mixed reception. However, I believe that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because of efficiency, preparatory experience for college, and a positive learning environment. I believe attending class through the internet results in more efficient learning for students. According to the psychological Yerkes-Dodson Theory, if one experiences too much stress, their level of performance will decrease dramatically. If students are too stressed out, they may not be performing at their absolute best. This may result in decreased test scores, class averages, and overall learning retention. Although some say that learning from home is counter intuitive, online learning can actually be more productive than at school. By learning at home, students no longer have to deal with the everyday stresses and hassles that they face at school. Being in the familiar presence of their own home instills a certain degree of relaxation in students, which is absolutely vital to boosting productivity. Through the use of online learning, students are likely to become more productive, efficient, and better learners. I believe students should be exposed to online learning to help prepare them for college. Many universities have already implemented online learning in their curriculum for a multitude of courses, such as Computer Science and Human Resources. By learning from home, kids know what to expect when they arrive at college, easing the transition for first-year students. Without a strong foundation in online learning, students will not know how to navigate the digital classroom and fall behind. Ultimately, students who know the mechanics, aspects, and overall feel of online learning will likely have a better chance of succeeding in college than those without it. In the end, I believe students who engage in online learning would have a greater preparedness for college. I believe students would benefit from attending classes from home because it is a more positive learning environment than school. In my experience as a high school student, many of my peers are very judgmental. They often make fun of and berate other students who struggle when learning. Students who need more time to grasp the content or just ask basic questions are often targeted and ridiculed. This makes it extremely difficult to meaningfully engage with the material because most traditional classrooms are unsafe learning environments. However, by staying at home, students are free from the contempt of their peers and able to reach their true learning potential. Therefore, I believe students would benefit from a more positive learning environment if they studied from home. As an educator, the success of one's students is of utmost importance. Therefore, I believe schools should seriously consider learning from home if they want to improve their students' quality of learning. The use of online learning can augment students in different ways, such as increased productivity or better preparation for higher education. By letting them learn from home, schools can help transform students into well-rounded, efficient individuals. After all, shouldn't schools push their students for the absolute best?"

This is also a very good way to help in a fun way. The Seagoing Cowboy program saves many animals who would have else not made it through that deadly war or natural disaster. This is the program made for people who love animals. There are always cows or horses on board that are being rescued. There is always work to be done as well. So, if your strong and like to work that could be a plus. Haybales and grain always need brought up from lower holds of the ship. Stalls always need cleaned and there is always work to be done. Sometimes you can catch a break on the way to another port and then you can relax. So why should you join the Seagoing Cowboy program? Well for one reason, your helping so many animals and people too. There is always animals that need our help because well, animals can not talk for themselves so we have to be there for them."
21123,0,"Dear Principle, Allow students to have phones because students will want to use their cell phones during lunch and other free time. Students would agree and so do I, because no student wants to not use their phone all day long while they are at school. The principle may agree or may not agree to this task, but students may not be as responsible at school with their phones out as they use them. Most of the students may agree so be more careful at school with their phones out during lunch or any other free time. Students may be happy with this text if all students can follow the rules of cell phones activity. I believe that all the students can be trusted with this idea to always keep their phone off during class sections. If some students decide not to follow this, then you can not allow them at all. Cell phones to me should be allowed, but only if all students can be trusted. Each student will try their best to not use it during class sections, but only during lunch and other free time at school. Every student wants to use them during school hours and have the trust they are given to use them and be respectful not to steal other peoples cell phones when they are being used. Each and every student may have a phone and I'm sure that they all agree that not having and phones on campus is harsh and mean. I will agree to this task and make sure that other students and not using them during class. Students may not like either of these tasks, but everyone will use one. If the students cant use their phones, then the teachers and the principle should not be allowed to use their phone either. The free time that is usable during class and be used at any time for the phones to be used if allowed. Always turn them off during class and are only able to be used during lunch or any free time during school hours. Allow this task to be used in our school as long as all students obey the rules of cell phone use. See if all students can complete this task by not using them during class and make sure that all phones are turned off at that time. Each students can try to complete this and not mess it up for the rest of the school and students. Thank you principle for agreeing or disagreeing to this task at our school."

It makes them feel that there is a lot of things that they can do. It makes people feel better on the inside. From reading to younger to picking up litter. By picking up litter we are helping the earth. We are saving the animals and the people. We are helping animals because we are picking up things that can chock them. Or things that they eat but they shouldn't. We are helping people because its saving our earth. That produces more for us by us helping. If we helped we would have less things we would have to kill for. We are also showing younger kids that taking a part in things like this is good. Even if it is reading to younger kids maybe that would encourage you to do more and you would want to make a big difference and you begin to take on more challenges. Then you start doing more and more. Kids would also like that other people care for them and they would like the fact that we want to help out. People that think of it just as taking away there free time would learn a lot from the experience. They would start to enjoy it just as much as other people did. Also if you think about it, it would go good on a college application. We should be required to do community service because it makes a very big difference. It makes people wonder a lot more about what else they could do to save the earth. It helps yourself and others."
17701,0,"Driverless cars would be the coolest thing ever! People would not have to drive tired and risk getting into an accident. People could sleep while there car takes them to work or school. The risk is putting your life on the line to have a car drive you around not knowing if it will get you there in one piece or not. I personally think driverless cars are a good concept but at the same time I think it is risky. Driverless cars could be good and be bad at the same time. They are good for the fact that you wouldn't have to drive. Think about that, just hop in your car press start and tell it where you want to go. Then you get to lay back and enjoy the ride. It will be a good thing for people who drink because then you wouldn't have to worry about people drinking and driving because techiniqually they are just drinking not driving. You also wouldn't have to worry about bad drivers or even illegal drivers. Driverless cars could be a very good thing to mankind but also it could end up being the worst thing we have done to ourselves. Driverless cars could be a terrible thing to the human race. People will start to become very lazy. People are already lazy enough we don't need cars that drive themselves. Peole will start to just sleep in the car and not pay attention to where it is taking them. They will forget how to drive so if they ever need to they will not know how. Also how can you trust a computer controlled car to drive you and your family around? It is risky to have it take you places because you don't know if it will just go crazy and drive your family into oncoming traffic or not. It is a risk most people would want to take but I am not completely sure if I am one. Driverless cars are a great idea and could possibly be the best thing that will happen to the world. It could also be the worst thing that will ever happen to us. We don't really know if they will be reliable enough to keep us safe or if they will even be able to get us where we need to go. I am in the middle on this topic because I am not sure if I would be happy to see driverless cars be a thing or if I would be nervous. Driverless cars could be either be a great thing to mankind or they could be a terrible thing, we will just have to wait and see where the future takes us."

Also i believe you should be able to play if you don't turn in your homework. or miss a day in practice because you are sick i really do believe if you get lower than a c grade average you should not be able to play also because some people just cant not get there grade up in science or math but its one thing if your failing a class and are trying you should be able to play if you are trying and getting help but still just don't get it.

18003,0,"My thoughts on driverless cars are not necessarily against it but I think the world can do without for awhile still, in other words there's no rush to get them out into the public streets. Although it would be very luxurious to have a car the drives itself, the safety issues & tedious appliances still need much work. Google has had driverless cars since 2009 that drove more than half a million miles without crashing but these cars still require human occupation in complicated traffic situations & driveways. I think the smart road system working in hand with the driverless cars would be more efficient but too expensive & requires ""massive"" upgrades to the roads so the idea was disgarded. So being that the smart cars would be driving on the roads we know of now it would need a pretty excessive amount of sensors to mimic the skill of a human behind the wheel. Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors in the left rear wheel, rotating senor on the roof, video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, inertial motion sensor, & the LIDAR on the roof that uses laser beams to project a 3D image of the car's surroundings. This is all so that in can mimic human driving ability as closely as possible & there's still much work to be done. BMW's development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" in 2013 was the 'better way' to go about having 'driverless' cars. This car was designed to drive itself standardly & notify the human driver inside when he or she needs to take over the wheel. Some might argue that having a driverless car that still needs you to drive is pointless so the ideas of in-car entertainment & information systems are going around. The ideas of these cars definitely are revolved around luxury & safety but new traffic laws would have to be made for these automobiles driving themselves because if an accident happens who is to blame? I believe there is still more troubleshooting to be as far as having a driverless car on the streets. Most states have even made it illegal to test computer-driven cars with the exception of California, Nevada, Florida, & the District of Columbia who allow limited use of semi-autonomous cars. After these cars are proved to be safe overall, then they will be introduced into the public streets."
23449,0,"The main purpose of education is to provide students with opportunities and help prepare them for their future. Education creates the foundation for many peoples' career choice as well as valued personal connections. While at home schooling may be a helpful option for a select few students, having a student attend public school allows them to gain skills in social development and acquire learning and educational opportunities. It is not realistic to say that someone could go through life completely solving all of their problems on their own. As humans, we tend to rely on those around us, sometimes even a little too much. Many people talk about the connections they made with other students in their classes as they went through schooling and how those people helped to shape them into who they have become today. Social connections allow students to find their own personalities, stay away from certain types of people, and see some of the different perspectives in our world. Also, students are more likely to obtain information when someone is telling it to them, or they are in a discussion about the topic, rather than reading it from a textbook or website. We are social creatures who learn from one another, and having face-to-face communication would only benefit our abilitiy to obtain and store educational content. When students are able to connect with their peers, they feel less lonely. This causes them to feel more comfortable in their learning environment and may allow them to take certain risks that will help their knowledge on any certain subject grow. We want our students to feel connected to not only what is being taught, but to the other peers and teachers as well. When a child attends school they are engulfed in a learning environment. Within this environment is nothing but learning experiences and opportunity. When attedning school, students have access to certain materials, technology, and lessons that they could not acquire elsewhere. Providing them with hands-on sources of development provides a second level understanding of the content being presented. Secondly, while at school, students often participate in group work and projects. As stated before, connecting with other students will help present different perspectives. When education is able to explain and embrace these perspectives, students gain a deeper, more indepth understanding of what they are learning about. We want students to have a variety of skill sets and we want them to know how and when they should use these new skills. When education is not only understood by one individual but the whole group, the foundation of tomorrow's concepts are more likely to be comprehended and further developed. While public schooling may seem like an opportunity booster if you will, it is not the best option for everybody. Some examples of conflicts that certain students face would be; medical conditions that prevent them from attending school, low income in their families, or behavioral conflcit that may prevent them from interacting with others. No matter how hard someone may try, they most likely will not be able to get through their life completely on their own. Our connections with those around us are what define us and what provide us with new purposes in life. We all must grow together. Therefore, we want our students to start interacting with other people as early as possible to build social skills that will help them later in life when dealing with conflicts. When students don't come to school becuase of conflict, all they are doing is avoiding that conflict and the issue never truly gets solved. However, online schooing may be the best option for students with medcal conditions so that they don't get too far behind and can still pariticipate as much as possible. Also, some students have to get jobs early in life because of finanical issues within their families. Online schooling can only provide them with an education to a certain extent. We want our students to have acess to the best and most beneficial education for their sake and for the hope of their future. Our future generations and students who are currently in school, are going to be our workforce in the next decade. If we want our social and technological development to keep advancing the way it is, we must push students to connect in the classroom. Amazing careers are provided through outstanding education and each student has a right to these careers. Having students physically attend school provides them with social development, learning and educational opportunity, and connections that could last them a lifetime."

Also if we would have thought that it actually was a atrifact from aliens then we wouldnt have made it public right away we would have went to go get more information, but the public wasnt satisfied so we went back and got them the information they wanted. Last but not least when we went back in April 8, 2001 (on a cloudless day) and took a picture it clearly showed that it was not built by alien lifeforms. When the pictures were took they were all taked in different time periods. In each picture they were different. In the first picture the face is clearly shown but we didnt get a clear enough picture, so we went back a second time to see take another one. In the second picture it is slightly hard to determened if the face is there or not. So of course we still werent satisfied, and yet again on April 8, 2001 we sent ANOTHER ship so take ANOTHER picture, i need to remind you this is on a cloudless day, and when the (multiple) pictures were taken, it was just some old hill with nothing special to it. A few days after recieving the picture NASA made it public! If we had truly thought that this was a ""Acient Artifact"" we would have kept it secret and not relised it publicly until after we (knew) that it was created by aliens. Which shows that we always knew it wasnt a alien artifact after all. I can see why most people had thought it was a acient alien artifact though. I mean most people dedicate their life finding out if there is more lifeforms out there. So most people had to have hope. For the sake of what they chose to do with there life. In April 8, 2001 NASA went back to snap ANOTHER photo. This day (to remind you) was a cloudless day. So we knew it would be the perfect day to snap the finishing photo. The photo that would settle everything. Not long after the photo was snapped NASA recieved it, and for some it was satisfying to find out that it wasn't a acient alien artifact. Others (on th other hand) were devistated (for the same reason in paragraph 3). The debate was over it, was and is official that it wasn't a acient alien artifact. Now do you understand? Have i finaly conviced you that it isnt and never was a alien life form. The facts i found in the article are pretty spot on to what happened so i hope i have finaly conviced you that its nothing special just a natural landform."

I'm much happier this way."" said Heidrun Walter a resdient in the area. Germany is not the only country to take action on this act. Paris, France has enforced a driving ban to clear the air. Car usage is a huge effect of gases that is release. People were fined if they were cought driving. The streets of Paris was a car-free city and public tranportation was free of charge. Late on that week the smog cleared enough that the baning of cars was realeased. As for the othr side of the world, Bogota, Colombia has taken action too. This capital city has a program called the Day Without Cars. This day bans the use of cars and only buses and taxis are permitted of usage. ""The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog."" according to the article. This program is incredible that citizens are enjoying and encouraging this act. A businessman said, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" These acts of limiting car usage has benfits for the enivonment. Bill Ford, executive chairman of th Ford Motor company has also created a plan. He wants to create cities in which, ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" These are advatanges that need to be taken as more and more areas are limiting car usage. They benfit our health, society, and enivornment.

13566,0,"Dear Principal, We should not be required to do community service hours. If kids do not want to do them then that is okay, but if they want to or need them for something else you should provide them the opportunity. You could ask the local community if there is anything that they need help with and then they could work on picking up litter or something. You could have us sign up to do the hours, but if we don't want to then we don't have to. You could also have some kind of reward for doing service hours like an ice cream party, or pizza party. You could have them go on a field trip somewhere if they do the hours. You could also have the kids decide on a relatively low budget idea. If the kids already have to much like they have a musical instrument, are doing a sport, or are studying for so many tests they should not be forced to do them for whatever reason.

18767,0,"Dear Senator, Concerning the topic of the merits and demerits of the Electoral College, herein abbreviated as EC. The Electoral College, through which our president and vice presidents currently are selected, is an institution that concerns many people in the United States. Some claim that the Electoral College is ""an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner."" (Posner) Though the lack of control over the president of the United States' election is disconcerting, the Electoral College, as you are aware is beneficial to elections, for example, it allows disputes to be settled over ties and complications in the popular voting process to be reduced, and minimises the amount of votes necessary for tallying, the Electoral College also provides accurate representation to citizens in certain areas. However, is this appropriate? Can the single justification for the disconnection from citizens of a nation to their president be justified on convenience? From what most sources suggest, the Electoral College is a safety system, in place to minimize the risk of complications arising from the voting process. The use of the Electoral College in this manner is unsettling to the American voter, and poses many risks for the basis of the United States. Therefore, the Electoral College should not be allowed to continue in its current manner. Foremost, the EC as a method of back-up to reduce risk of complications in popular voting is inappropriate. In theory, the EC is not invalid; however, the way in which it is implemented is prone to error, or lack thereof, for reasons that harms the voter's representation. As each citizen votes, he/she votes for an EC slate, with each party selecting a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee. Richard Posner in his publication ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,"" states that, ""it is entirely possible the the winner of the electoral vote will nto win the national popular vote."" However, Posner, immediately states thereafter, ""yet, that has happened very rarely."" Posner is correct in this case that this phenomena does happen rarely. The reason for this happening rarely is the fact that the EC adopts a ""winner-take-all"" voting scheme, where the majority candidate wins all of the EC votes for a specific state. To understand how this is a poor way of electing a president, a view into one's ethicality is necessary. The president of the United States is meant to represent the largest amount of the population, inevitably, there will be many that are unhappy with their president. Representing the largest amount of the US population requires that the candidate in question, theoretically, receives the most votes by popular polling. An informed American studies the resolutions and principles of potential candidates, and makes an informed decision as to which one represents their resolutions and principles. Upon deciding which candidate suits their needs, this example citizen casts his/her vote. This vote is a marker which signifies that a certain candadate will, if elected, represent this voter most. Should more than 50% of Americans decide that a certain candidate suits them best, that candidate will represent the largest amount of the American population. The EC, in comparison, awards the full amount of votes possible to the winner of the majority of electors. If 55% of the electors vote one way, and 45% in the opposite direction, the 55% will take precedence, and win the total possible votes for that state. Unfortunately, certain citizens who would have been represented accurately by popular polling may be deprived of the representation by the EC. The disconnect between the American citizen and the president of the United States is detrimental to the whole nation, including the executive body. The Electoral College is criticized to have disconnected the United States citizen from his/her presidential candidates. However, this has been justified with the claim that ""the EC saves the complications of polling the entire American population."" There are inherent risks with polling the entire population: the fact that there are too many votes to keep an accurate count of. Keeping accurate track of said votes, however, is the responsibility of the current president, who, even during the end of his term, must represent the people who voted for him in providing them with a way to elect their president of choice. In this case, ""practical"" justification signifies the lack of interest in allowing the United States citizen to vote. A dispute of outcome in popular vote is high, the possibility of dispute in the EC is less, due to less electors being polled. The EC attempts to provide an accurate representation of the population, ensuring that the candidate selected is a candidate that suits most of each region, not one in specific. Unfortunately, despite efforts, this system is not accurate. Posner states in his publication that, ""the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election,"" morally, his reasoning is spot-on. An uneducated voter is dangerous to the society he/she lives in, regardless of country. By contrast, the United States guarantees every citizen a right to vote for his/her representatives; pursuant to this mandate, a person of great power cannot be allowed to arbitrate that ""only educated voters should decide the election,"" simply because an educated voter is not defined, and cannot be defined. Large states also play a role in the EC's inaccuracies. While one may argue that larger states have more citizens, therefore, a candidate chosen by popular vote represents those citizens, regardless of their geographic location, smaller states, argue, conversely, that states, as defined entities, should have the power to have equal representation in congress, and the EC. Reflecting back to the resolution of mal-apportionment of the Senate, two senators were granted to each state, regardless of size. The Electoral College, however, does not apportion this representation evenly for smaller states. Popular vote, obviously, depends on the population of a certain state for a candidate to be elected. The EC also depends on a state's population. Smaller states who do not have many EC votes arguably should have a chance for an equal vote, as the Senate provides for in the United States congress. The EC does not represent this opposite side to representation. Understanding the root of this argument is crucial to being able to make a difference. Where accuracy is possible, it should be achieved, where accuracy is seemingly impossible, it should be striven for. Allowing the EC to continue in its current manner is inaccurate, by any standard, and sacrifices accuracy and representation for convenience of election. The EC should, when properly instituted, regard itself as a body where the people are further supplemented in their popular representation, not opposed. Senator, I have left the personal remarks to the ending of this letter, but would like to stress my discontent with the EC as it stands today. I understand there are practical limitations that cannot be met, I understand that the EC may be more convenient when it comes to hiring employees to track votes, and co-ordinate the process as a whole, but it is something that must be done, and striven for, in the most accurate way possible. You, Senator, were elected by popluar vote because the population chose you as the candidate that best suited our interests, and were most likely to defend our interests in the face of opposition. Where we have benefitted you from voting as we have, we request you now represent us in the election of our presidential candidate that best suits our interests nationally. For the reasons provided theretofore, we strongly urge a negation of the Electoral college in favour of a more accurate voting method. Yours, PROPER_NAME"
15535,0,"To whom it may concern: I don't think that changing the school policy about having a B average to participate in sports is fair. Some students who participate in sports sometimes have a challenging class and requires lots of time on their homework. We know that taking on a sport means that you will need to balance your homework and the sport you're taking on but having a C average is pretty good if you're participating in a sport because your juggling your sport, homework, family and friends. Especially, us teens, we always want to go hang out or do something fun. If the policy changes to where you need to average a B, then it's going to be hard to the students because if they are super focused on school, they wont be focused during the game. If the student is focused on the sport, they wont focus on schoolwork so having a C average or higher is good for them. I can relate to how some students would feel if you would change the policy because when I was in 6th grade, I had to find time for basketball, another basketball league outside of school, friends and schoolwork. I know it's my responsibility to do all of it but it was pretty stressful and I was only in 6th grade. If you wish to keep the policy, our students who are participating in a sport would benefit them because it would allow them to focus on the sport they love and schoolwork. If you do not wish to keep the policy and change it, students wouldn't really benefit from it but would just make them more focused. I am not saying that being focused is bad but soon, students will get tired of the routine of: Going to school, practice, homework, shower, and sleep. Then they will stop doing sports and wouldn't be active, and become lazy. They also wont have time for their family because they are too focused on their grades. But maybe for some students it will help them push harder on their schoolwork. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME"

Also, on our way they let us stop to ride in a Venice in Italy. I could have never image that. The people on the ship did something very special for us. They let me see Acropolis in Greece. Not only did I see new things, I got to go to Italy, Greece, Crete, and Chine. Four countries in two weeks. When we made it to China we were able to relax. I was able to play Volleybal, fencing, baseball, and boxing. Before we left we had a Table Tennis tournament. When I was done play, I sat down and had a silent moment of reading. This things help the time pass bye. Through all of this I was able to help out familes. I help out the familes by taking care of the animals. So that they don't have to worry about it. It makes me feel good that I am helpping people out. In conclusion, I would no trade this job for nothing. Even though I broke one of my ribs. It is all worth it in the long run.

The kids that are out here cleaning up the streets are doing a wonderful job but we need more support. If the people that are saying the don't have enough time to do community service because of sports,should help out kids in the neighborhood stay out of trouble. They could go on the field or in the gym and play after the practices are over. People who are in band could perform a concert for the people in the neighborhood.They could also raise money and build a new park and plant some new trees, the kids could help. I will help you and the staff to encourage other students to help the community but donating a little time for a very good cause. Not everyone agrees that this is the best way to help out but when they see how good the community looks after we are done with our hard work the will believe that it is possible for change if every one chips in. I think this plan will help or community and change how people treat our environment. Hopefully real soon we see some changes in our community and it will get better. I think you should try and make every student do something to help us out, thank you for your time. sincerely, STUDENT_NAME"

Millions of people use cars on a day to day basis, but if we were all to limit car usage then a lot of things would be different and better in most cases. In German Suburb, hardly anyone uses vehicles. In Paris, they banned driving due to it causing smog. They even have a car-free day in Bogota, which is a surprisingly becoming a big hit. People everywhere are trying to end the car culture. It would stop twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and around fifty percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. In Germany, seventy percent of Vauban`s families do not own any cars, and fifty-seven percent sold a car to move there. A lady named Heidrun Walter said, "" When i had a car i was always tense. I`m much happier this way."" People find it less stressful and better to the Earth by limiting the usage of cars. Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On cold nights and warmer days it causes the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. Congestion was down sixty percent in the capital of France, after five days of the intensifying smog. If everyone were to limit car usage, none of this would occur again. The air and our environment would be better for us to be in. Colombians had a free-day of no cars, they hiked, biked, skated or took busses to work or wherever they needed to go during that day. Due to this, traffic dramatically dropped and new resturants and upscale shopping districts have copped up. This day is a really big hit in Columbia because how much it benefitted from this. There are so many advantages from limiting the usage of cars. Its greatly effected Germany, Europe, France, Paris, Columbia and other places. It would stop some of the greenhouse gas emissions, the smog causing bad air surrounding us, drop traffic, and build stores a lot closer by. These are just some advantages on stopping the usage of vehichles world wide."
5928,0,"""Seagoing Cowboys"" take care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. When one becomes a Seagoing Cowboy, one's life is changed forever. There are three main reasons for which one should become a Seagoing Cowboy, and they are the beautiful places one might visit, the good cause that one is helping, and the fun one can have while doing the job. In this argument, I will elaborate on each of these reasons. First, I will expand on what is meant by beautiful places. The first reason that I think one should become a Seagoing Cowboy is all of the beatiful places you might visit. When one is a Seagoing Cowboy, and one travels through Europe to help people, there are plenty of opportunity to visit beautiful places, such as Venice, Italy, where one can take a gondola ride through the streets of water, or the Acropolis, in Greece. One also occasionally finds beautiful places on one's way to another place, such as the Panama Canal, if one is going to China. That is the first reason for which one should become a Seagoing Cowboy. Now, I shall elaborate on the second reason. The second reason for which one should become a Seagoing Cowboy is that one will be helping a good cause. War is a horrible thing, and sometimes, animals cannot be kept. Animals are very important beings, and we should try to protect them to our greatest extent. So going on trips just to help animals, which happens to be what Seagoing Cowboys do, is a very worthy cause. If one truly cares for animals, and one has the opportunity to help both animals and people, then why shouldn't one do so? There is no reason at all. Now, I shall elaborate on the third, and final reason for which I believe one should become a Seagoing Cowboy. The third, and final reason, for which one should become a Seagoing Cowboy, is the fun that one will have while doing the job. When one is a Seagoing Cowboy, one often has spare time during the job, and there are plenty of opportunities to meet new people, and to have fun with them, playing games such as volleyball, and baseball. One might even find a lifelong friend, working as a Seagoing Cowboy. If someone does not have very many friends, they would have a chance of finding one as a Seagoing Cowboy. That is the third and final reason for which I think one should become a Seagoing Cowboy. Now, I shall finish this argument. Seagoing Cowboys take care of cattle that has been sent overseas. There are several reasons for which one should become a Seagoing Cowboy, and they are the beautiful places one might visit, the worthy cause one is serving, and the fun one might have. Becoming a Seagoing Cowboy is a good idea for all of us. Now why would anyone think otherwise?"
4624,0,"Some schools require a summer project at the end of every school year. Summer projects help students maintain the information that was learned from the whole year, inside of students brains. They can also be used to get a head start with information for the following year. Summer projects are more beneficial when they are teacher designed because teachers have more experience. Them having experience lets them know what important information to put into the project, and how to challenge the students with that information. Although having a teacher design a summer project sounds more logical, some people believe that the projects should be student designed. Making students design the projects can be beneficial for them because they are learning to work like how a teacher does. Even though the student is making it, they still have to put it together like how a teacher would. However, students do not have enough experience on how to teach and make projects for a certain amount of people, which is why summer projects should be teacher designed. Teachers have more experience in teaching than anybody else. They go to college to get their degree in teaching so that they can be qualified to teach. Some teachers further their education while they are teaching just so they can be updated and informed with new learning techniques and other important updated information. All students learn in different ways. Teachers get taught how to handle different types of learners. Teacher designed projects have a good amount of information that is needed to be successful. Since teachers have experience, they know how to put together the information the right way. The way the information is put into the project is very important because if it is all over the place then it will not make sense to anyone doing it. It would also be a waste of time for the students doing it. If the information is put in correctly then that is beneficial for everyone and helps the students to learn and obtain the information instead of forgetting it. Making the project not too easy is very important also. While putting together the project, teachers will make it challenging so that the students can obtain the information correctly. Making the project too easy does not help anyone and wastes time. Challenging the students helps them to actually have to learn and remember the content that they learned from that year. If a student designed the project, they would most likely not challenge them or their peers at all. In conclusion, summer projects being designed by teachers makes more sense overall, because they have more experience and know how to teach in different way that helps everyone. The projects being student designed does not make sense. Students brains are not fully developed yet and are not ready to correctly make a summer project for all students. The students most likely do not remember most of the information that they learned to put it into one assignment for all of their classmates."
24432,0,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Attending classes from home would not be considered beneficial due having less access to many items they could get at a school building; including school materials, communication with other students and as well as communication with teachers. There are many materials a student need for their educational benefits. A lot of these materials are also expensive and difficult to use without the guidance of a physical teacher such as textbooks, measuring materials, graphing calculators, etc. Many of these materials are already in a school classroom, and the student has access to them for free. To spends hundreds of dollars for school material may be difficult for the student and the guardian providing for the students' needs. With each of these materials, they should be able to provide a better understanding to the content the student is learning. Often these materials are provided to schools by taxes, the community pays for materials that students use for their better understanding of whatever that subject may be. From obtaining these materials with taxes, students in that class will get a better understanding of the material they're learning, and will make their work easier to do. For example, having a graphing calculator in geometry. This is a needed material but prices can start off at $100. Not many students can simply make a huge purchase of a calculator. To have to study at home though, a graphing calculator will rarely be provided for that student, thus they have to pay that same price or even more. Students should be put into a classroom environment and surrounded by many types of people and things. Doing so teaches the student life and communication skills in which is very useful for life after their education. They will have access to group work and presentations which provides skills of teamwork and independence in the long run. Many have difficulty in communication skills due to limiting themselves to technology usage and relying on it in many ways, including avoiding communication skills. Often, students bury themselves in technology to avoid situations of talking to others due to the feeling of anxiety and having the constant fear of ""what do they think of me?"" mindset, and never proceeding to face that fear and talk to others. For students to use technology to get their education will further reduce the basic skills of communication by not having the ability of talking to others. Communication is a skill that takes many years to develop, often adults still struggle with that skill today. Since students spend most of their life learning, they should take those twelve years of education and also learn communication among each other and even adults around them. Having a classroom environment can also offer a better teaching and understanding of material one may learn. There would be better resources for an understanding such as a teacher going over the subject ""one on one"" with a student, and students around the individual who may have a better understanding of the topic. At home, a student is limited as to what they can do to have a better understanding of a subject they struggle in. They won't have access to ask their teacher what they are struggling in and if they do, it would be over technology and not physically there. Being physically there can allow both the teacher and student to have a better understanding of the question being asked and the question being solved or explained. Being in a school environment can also teach the student professionalism. Schools offer dress codes or uniforms not only for distractions, but to teach the students professionalism of their dress code and behavior. Being educated on professionalism and proper adequate can help when getting a job, have better offers/opportunities, and will overall take one seriously on an eye to eye level. This is beneficial if they are ever in a tight situation in life, in which is something can is rarely learned at home. To stay home and attend classes from there, students have the leisure of relaxing at home, not worrying about their appearance and gives an excuse to limit their hygiene, their manners, and ways of going out to public places. Schools can offer a student many opportunities to explore the future path they want to go in as well. Many offer extra curricular activities, in which include clubs, sports, or a simple gathering. Schools can also offer travel opportunities, many becoming exchange students, or simply going on a field trip. They often offer these for free or at a much lower price than if doing an extra curricular activity or traveling by oneself. Many schools also offer advice on financial aids for college. During spring or summer break, students can be sent to a college from their middle or high school to be offered many scholarship opportunities, and learn how to get scholarships and financial aid. Often, for participating in a club or sport, students can maintain a scholarship for their future as well. To have an education from home, these opportunities are often limited for that student. Participating in such can be very expensive, schools often get these prices much lower, and sometimes even free. This automatically limits opportunities for a student getting an education from home from scholarships, opportunities to know what career path they want and travel opportunities. Students would not have a benefit from getting an education from home. Communication skills between them, adults and other students would be stripped away from them, opportunities can be taken, expenses could be very high, and they could lack material for a better understanding. Having an education from home makes that student lose the ""high school student life"", and overall not receive the best education as they could."
8771,0,"There have only been a few spacecrafts sent to Venus but none of them lasted long scientist are trying to figure out how to get a spacecraft to hover over the surface. The reason is to collect samples from there and then be able to make it back or have enough time to send the information the spacecraft got, back to NASA. For example "" Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcaneos, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface"". We are having trouble getting the data back because the spacecraft it is getting destroyed. It may be very expensive to attempt to get to Venus but it could give us some good insight on what we can research and study back at Earth. The stuff we find on Venus could be benefical to us going to different planets and exploring different parts of the Solar System. In conclusion we shouldn't let money be a factor on if we get a spacecraft to Venus we just have to figure out how to safely get there and be able to gather the data from the spacecraft. If we do find something we will most likely go back and try to find more of it or more helpful resources."
12069,0,"Why does NASA consider the ""Face of Mars"" to be a natural landform? They claim that the ""face"" is the Martian equivalent to a butte or mesa. There are multiple points of evidence that support this claim. Firstly, NASA has traveled to the location multiple times, and photographed it extensively. In the passage, it is stated that NASA sent two different spacecraft to photograph the formation three different times. While Viking I's camera appears to capture a face-like structure, this is not the case. In the passage, it is said that to confirm that this was a natural occurence, NASA sent the Mars Global surveyor to capture another image. This image was much sharper, and appeared to favor the idea that the site was natural. Some people were not satisified due to a claimed ""haze"" that hid the structure during the cloudy, windy period on Mars. The Global Surveyor was sent back a second time, and this time, it captured clear, still images that are at the absolute maximum resolution. (About 1.5 meters per pixel.) This was more than enough to capture an image of any structures on the site, but none were found. In addition, NASA has no reason to keep the public misinformed about the so-called ""alien face."" Quite the opposite actually, as NASA would benefit immensely from the funds that could be acquired using the publicity. If there was conclusive evidence supporting the claim the ""alien face"" was a monument constructed by ancient Martian civilizations and not just a natural formation on the planet, NASA would advertise the claim and it's evidence in an attempt to receive more funding. On the other hand, I can see how some people could be fooled into believing that there was once a civilization on Mars. In the passage, NASA uses a caption that says the structure ""resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" However, now that NASA has investigated the site and taken multiple photos confirming the site as a rock formation, the structure should be regarded as a regular Martian mesa that posseses an uncanny resemblance to a human face. In conclusion, the ""Face of Mars"" has been proven to be little more than a large rock formation that simply bore an unnatural resemblance to a human face. The belief that it is otherwise a structure of ancient alien origin is unsubstantiated and incorrect."
24175,0,"Have you ever been trying to pay attention in class but your friends or someone in your class is being a major distraction? Or have you been following the teachers orders but your teacher is moving at a faster pace than you can learn? Some students have these problems in public schools so I'm going to be explaining the reasons why students learning at their own pace without any distractions at home will benefit more than students learning in a public school. One reason I believe students will benefit more from doing work at home is because they won't get distracted from other students who mess around a lot during class. Students messing around could cause other students to get distracted and not focus on their work or what the teacher is trying to lecture. If they were getting educated online at home, they wouldn't get distracted by anyone because they're alone. Being alone at home in a one on one conversation between the teacher and the student wouldn't cause any distractions for the student. Another reason I believe students would benefit by being taught online rather than in a public school is because teachers teach at a class pace and there are some students out there that can't learn at a class pace so they fall behind and have to catch up on work later. If the student were getting taught at home, they can go at any pace they want and won't fall behind. Not falling behind will be really beneficial to students because some get really stressed out when they have a lot of work to do. My final reason on why students being taught at home would benefit them more than students being taught at public schools is that they will get a good understanding of the curriculum. In public schools, you could possibly get a teacher that you dont like or one that can't teach well. This could cause you to not understand what the teacher is lecturing. If the student was taking the class online, they would get a teacher that they would like or they would just learn the material themselves by reading. Taking school online at home does have down sides such as not getting much public speaking skills which could cause some people to be anti-social but thats easy to overcome. Not getting distracted, learning at your own pace, and getting a teacher that you like are some of many of the reasons why I believe that students being taught online would benefit more than students being taught in a public school."
20498,0,"The Electoral College is not fair and should be abolished. Did you know that 60 percent of voters would prefer a more direct way to vote then what we have now. That is a lot of people who just want a more trustworthy and direct voting process. The Electoral College should be abolished because you can't trust the people you elect, and many states do not even see any electors at all. Having your trust in people who you only see campaigns for on television is pretty hard to do. Honestly that is quite ridiculous for them to ask of us. In source 2, paragraph 11, Plumer tells us about how sometimes ""faithless"" electors disregard their party's candidate and vote for whomever they please. So is it really worth going through the trouble of electing poeple who might not even do as they said they would. Posner on the other hand explains that the trust in the elector is rarely betrayed (source 3, paragraph 16). But is it really worth risking four, maybe eight years of our lives to trust poeple we really do not know. Not to mention how it could affect our jobs and lives at home if this does happen. Did you know seventeen states didn't see any candidates at all in the 2000 campaign. In source 2, paragraoh 13, Plumer talks about how candidates do not visit states they know the can't win or states that they know they will definintly win. This leaves many states who do not get to see any candidates at all. This makes those states feel like their votes do not count and worry if they their new president willl have any regards for their interest. In source 3, paragraph 19, Posner says that this is a good thing that candidates do not visit states they know the can't win or states that they know they will definintly win because then that candidate can focus on the states that may be undecided or swing states. He believes this is a good thing because a candidate with appeal in only a few states is unlikely to be a good president. But you are leaving out a big proportion of the United States population who would love the expiernce of hearing a cadidate give a passionate speech about why he\she should be elected. We can come to the conclusion that the Electoral College should be abolished because you really can't trust the people you elect, and many states do not even see any electors at all, which then makes them feel worthless. Furthermore, we can say that the new way to elect the president should be more direct and fair."
2372,0,"The idea of a car-free life has become more appealing around the world. In the United States, South America and across Europe, they have developed new ways of transportation that seem to be more beneficial. In these souces they explain the many advantages of limiting car usage such as its better for the environment and people find more alternative ways of transportation easier and cheaper. There are many benefits to limiting car usage and the first is it improves the environment. In Source 1, it says that reducing car usage would be, ""A huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes"". Passengers in Europe are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions and 50 percent in the United States. ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,"" said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America. In that change recently,there has been many efforts to promote ""car reduced"" communities. In Source 2, Paris shows that they have made improvements in banning driving on certain days of the week due to smog. That smog cleared enough for the people to drive on days they were allowed to. The second benefit to limiting car usage would be that people find more alternative ways of transportation easier and they are happier. ""When i had a car iwas always tense. Im much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor. Many people expressed that other ways of transportation like biking or walking are much easier. In Source 3, it explains that Colombia has car-free days where they skate, bike, hike, or take buses instead. ""Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife. In Source 4, it says that because of other ways of transportation are easier and cheaper, ""Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses each year."" It goes on to explain that ""Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed werent going to work anyway."" As more people become jobless, they find that taking buses or walking is much easier. That could be an advantage because Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company laid out a plan where cities in which ""pedstrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" In conclusion, there are many ways in limiting car usage can be benefical such as with the enviroment, to the people, and it can change in the way this world operates. Living a car-free life would soon be very desirable in this world soon."
21540,0,"2/17/2011 Dear Principal, I believe that the idea of allowing Students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods, and free times as long as the phones are off during class time is a great idea. Many Students Today get in trouble for using their phone so by making it an option to use outside of class time may limit the amount of students getting into trouble. Common consequences for cell phone usage In modern day schools, are Warnings, confiscation of the device, and lastly confiscation and a parent or legal guardian must get it back for you. By using this new cell phone policy, Parents and students could be relieved from stress. There will always be those students who are going to text anyways no matter what during Lunch/Recess. Therefore Policy #2 wouldn't be such a great idea. Students who get their phone taken in school by an administrator or teacher, may react in anger or aggression, leading to a bigger problem like talking back to a teacher, or starting a fight out of anger. which would of course have bigger consequences, In Conclusion Policy #1 is better because it has a good effect on both students and teachers. I hope you look into my thoughts and opinions, For the benefit of our school. Thank You. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME"
23339,0,"Techonology has becoming powerful that let students and teachers to give and receive classes online. Disadvantages or adventages of taking classes online? These question are faced today by students deciding taking online classes. Often students work part or full time jobs while going to school or collage so their time is valuable. these students want to make the right decisions in choosing classes so knowing the disaventage and adventages is important. I believe that online classes is a good opportunity for students as it gives flexibility, they often offer any type of class desired and provide access to faculty, and they often offer accelerate courses. To begin with, one of the best adventage of online classes is flexibility. A student can usually take the course any time during the day or week. While there are custom essay writing and researching assigments to complete, the precise time to take the class often depends on the student's desire. Students who work are able to take the class based on their schedule. Many students work on afternoon. The flexibility makes it possible for a person to complete the course, while attending school or collage courses in person might be imposible due to their work schedules. Secondly, another great adventage of online courses is that almost any type of course can be found online. Distance learning course are often avaliable from a number of collages. A person can simply use the google to find a class. While most people believe a disadventage of taking online courses is that the students can not have access to faculty a member, the fact is that many online courses offer a grater access to faculty. Shy students are able to ask questons and receive the answer back almost inmediately. Lastly, Online courses are convenient for most undergraduate and graduate students who can study when they want and they can finish writing or researching assigments based on their own person schedules. The fact is online classes offer flexibility and conveniece that are often vital to students who work and have families. In addition, many students are looking for classes that are advanced to complete the course faster. The best way to advance in the class is to make it online because in the regular schools it takes a long time as there are students who get behind and the teachers wait for them since everyone has to go at the same time. To conclude, with online classes, students do all the work at their own pace. As long as they meet their deadlines and participate apropriately online. Also, studying online requires more self motivation and time mangement skills because students will spend a lot of time on their own without someone physically close to keep them focused on deadlines. Online course will not only teach students geology or poetry, it will also help them become more self motivated, a trait that will make them stand out in the workplace and beyond. It will teach educators to be mature choosing right decisions as it will make them explore more and be students with an open mind."
10359,0,"I think that the use of the new technology to read the emotional expressions of people is not valuable. If people want to tell you how they feel, then they probably will. I do not think you should ""invade"" their privacy, feelings, and emotions. People have their own feelings and they have them because they are THEIRS. If they wanted to share their feelings then they would. But a lot of people want to keep their feelings to themselves. Humans every day kind of do the same thing as this new technology does. The article states "" In fact, we as humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day."" Which is true, because if say we see a friend who is upset about something, and they are not really crying or anything, but you can just tell by their face that they are upset; then that's using a ""humanized version"" of the new technology. That is almost the same thing as the new technology, except with the new technology it literally SCANS your face and has access to your personal emotions. It invades your private mind. Another reason that supports my opinion is that the student's peers could find out the results from a person's scan and tell everybody when most people want to keep their feelings/emotions to themselves. This is not a good idea, it is sharing to all kinds of other people how someone feels and that is not okay. You have to let people have their own thoughts. When they did the scan on da Vinci's Mona Lisa painting, that is fine because it's just a painting. The painting is not a living thing with feelings. I think that if someone wants to use the new technology to scan historic pictures or historic things then that is okay. I think it's important to understand our past. If finding out what someone from the past was feeling helps us understand history then yeah sure! Why not do it. It's not going to hurt anybody or anything like if you were to use the technology on something living. In conclusion, I believe that we should not use the new technology on anything that is living and has feelings. But I think that it is okay to use it on historic things (like da Vinci's Mona Lisa painting) so we can really truly understand the word's past. It is important for people to have their own feelings, emotions, and thoughts. It is also okay for people to share their feelings. But they should not always have to share them. I feel like in a way, this new technology is ""forcing"" people to share their emotions, feelings, etc."

We'll never really know the truth unless somebody goes there or since its been a while it may not even be there anymore. If you went there would you come back with false or true evidnece to help support what you think it is. On May 24,2001 the text say, ""Twenty five years ago something funny happened around Mars. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be starring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia."" This shows that if this two mile long ""human face"" was real this must of had to of been a giant living on Mars. The text also says ""Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" This shows that this helps us know that it could of just of been a Martian mesa since its common around Cydonia. In the image of 1998 I can see where they see the face, but then look at the picture from 2001 it just looks like a large landform. Yes it could of decayed but then by the time 1998 come it should have already been decayed and you would of thought that from image from 1976. If the mesa was a human face then it wouldn't really have all those cracks like the image from 2001 has. The text says "" A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see."" What kind of rucous do you think this would of caused? The text says "" A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" This shows that they might of added the resembles a human face, because they can't really put if it was unless somebody actually went to Mars. Many people would have had there different opinions on if it were really a human face without the 'Resembles a human head"" part or not. The authors who wrote the story about the resembles a human head thought it would be a good way to have the public engage in attention toward Mars. It did! the text says ""The Face on Mars has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows."" This shows that the Face on Mars is so popular even though it couldn't be a real human head."

Today in our world of driving there are many people that don't care about the security of our kids and their ownselves. Many Adults and teenagers are always on their phones distracted from the road and putting theirself in danger. Especially teenagers, teenagers are the most irresponsible on the road today. A lot of teenagers like to go party and get drunk. Well unfortunately for us that is a big problem for drivers and parents. Teenagers drive drunk and text on their phones while driving. Well with Cars that dont need drivers, Teenagers will be safer more than ever instead of putting their life and someone else's in danger. In Conclusion, if we have cars that don't need drivers, teenagers will be less likely to get in a car accident, and aldults including teenagers won't be on their phones because they're not driving. So if we had driverless cars today there would be less accidents, deaths, and we could also save money on gas."
3165,0,"Did you know the 75% of high school students do their summer assignments in the last week of the summer. Some even do it in the first week of school. This percent would decrease if the students projects were self chosen. It would help them by giving them the choice of doing what they want to do. They would be able to be more creative, be able to do it faster so they can enjoy their summer and some families money is a struggle and they can't afford the teacher directed projects so they can do what works for them. When a project is student directed they have the freedom to do what they want and be creative with it and actually enjoy doing the project. I have had hundreds of projects in my eleven years of schooling and some of my favorite ones were in my cooking class last year. My favorite one in that class was a food truck project. My teacher said you have to make a cardboard box food truck, make a menu, and make one item on the menu. Otherwise we were free to do what we wanted. I ended up making some really good food because she said just do what you want. I also ended up getting a good grade because I could be creative on that project. One major problem with summer assignments is that students either forget about them and don't do them or they push them off until the last minute. I am one of those students that procrastinates until the last minute to do my AP summer assignments. It makes it very challenging to do them when there is only one week in summer left and I want to have fun and enjoy the last parts of the summer. I have friends that are worse than me and either don't do the AP work at all or they do them at the beginning of the school year, but if they were self chosen they would not have the issue of not wanting to do them because they can do what ever they want and make it what they feel is good. My final reason is more on the extreme side but I have seen it happen. It is where the teachers summer work is a large project that is simple but costly and some families that I have seen do not have enough money to do the project. They normally end up failing the project because they never did the work, but if they could do what they want for it they could've passed. Where if they were short on money and it was limiting them on what they could do if they needed to they could do a less expensive project and save their money for other things. There are many other reasons that students should be able to do their own thing for their projects over the summer but here are just a few of the reasons that people say that they should remain teacher directed. It's that it is a lot easier for the teacher to grade based on what they are looking for because they can grade on their scale of how close it is to what they want. But when it is student choice they can be creative and have fun, the project can go faster and they can enjoy their summer for what is it and it can be more cost effective for the families that have lower incomes."

If students want to do sports or activities and they want to get a B or higher, this makes the students work more harder to get up to a B or higher and play sports. So it is putting pressure on them to work more harder. The students have the privilege to participate in sports, it has to come with requirements. Also by changing the policy, students will have a good grade and they are doing sports or activities. They will not have to worry about there grade a B instead of C or lower. This will make students achieve higher and make their school very proud of getting A' s and B' s. The students will have good confidence about your grades and being on the sports team. This is why I am arguing with the principal by playing sports or activities unless they have a B average."

If you don't le student do P.E. then it could lead to obesity, not active in appearance and knowledge, and also in eating right too. If you don't let student have P.E at school then it could led to obesity. Sure some students don't like P.E but at least they try to participate because teachers help them. students will think oh we have a C in P.E so we cant participate! Wrong, if they don't participate then what are they going to be doing they will be sitting down and just watching or doing work. Sitting down and not being active can be dangerous to you and your health. If students don't do P.E then what are they going to do. Every student that are in Junior High Schools, at least have one period when they do P.E or some sort of activity. kids our age need to be active and energized because of all the amount of things we do in school and it gets stressful. if we don't have P.E all because of our grades then we wont be that active. P.E stands for physical education, not sitting down all day and doing work. being active allows students mind to be open and thinking because they have a break and able to get a break from learning. If students aren't active then they wont look good because of their weight and also the amount of learning they have been getting and no break. they will be weak and wont be able to think we will be like zombies, just staring of into space! P.E is important for our minds to work. P.E is also important in eating right. Kids will think that oh i have P.E at school i can pull of the extra pounds if i run. they don't realize what grade they have in that class. If they don't exercise in school then where else are they going to? once they get started on junk food they wont be able to stop. They will look bad, weigh more than they use to, and be more weaker. they wont be able to do it at school, all because they don't have a B in that class. Although parents think that this idea is appropriate because, they think oh well my kid has soccer practice or basketball practice or they can play at nutrition by basketball or football, there is no problem he/she will get their exercise there. What they don't know is that student loose most of their weight at school, because of P.E, it does activities that you don't normally do at home or at a team. in school you do weight room, Frisbee, running, soccer, strength exercises. there are a lot of fun things that are fun and help you in your health. For these three reason, have p. e Just because of"

Limiting car usage around the world would be greatly beneficial. Limiting automobile usage would decrease hazardous rates of air pollution in regions at which cars are commonly driven. The tailpipes of cars release toxins, often produced by the automobile's fuel, that severely pollute the environment once in the air. According to experts, ""passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50%...in the United States""(Source 1). This amplifies the dangerous impact automobiles have on the environment. Paris, a car-using country, reached extreme levels of smog due to automobile emissions. According to Reuters, ""Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic matter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London""(Source 2). Due to this, a ban was made on car usage and the smog eventually cleared. Automobiles' emissions of greenhouse gases are utterly harmful for the environment. Decreasing the utilization of automobiles would also ease stress levels among the community. In Vauban, Germany, cars are practically forbidden causing the suburb's streets to be free of the persistent humming of a motor. ""When I had a car I was actually tense. I'm much happier this way,""(Source 1) says Heidrun Walter, a citizen of the car-free city. This illustrates how the loss of automobiles can bring tranquility to a region. Bogota, Columbia hosts the Day Without Cars, a day where the driving of an automobile is not permitted. According to Andrew Selsky, due to this occasion, ""pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks"" and ""rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic""(Source 3). Lowering the usage of automobiles would relieve individuals of tensity caused by driving. Automobiles are an excemplary form of transportation but their impact isn't as beneficial for other purposes. Car emissions of greenhouse gases promote global warming and traffic only tenses drivers. Limiting the utilization of these vehicles would decrease if not diminish their negative impacts on the world."
13592,0,"Dear principal, Community service is very important. It helps make the community a better place for everyone. I think that every student should do a little bit of community service. Even if it is just for 30 minutes a week, it will help. If the students are doing community service such as cleaning up trash at a park or on the side of the road, we will have a more clean environment. Helping at elementary schools can help students raise grades, and the teachers wouldn't have to stress so much about some students that aren't doing their best. One suggestion I have is that we do an activity at school that involves community service. We could go read to maybe read to a kindergarten class or do some arts and crafts with them. We could also go on a walk around the school with plastic bags cleaning up trash and putting them in recycling bins. If the problem is students not wanting to do service then they could be rewarded after doing it. For example students are always looking for reasons to get more lunch time. You could have a service project after school once a week and however many students show up you could add that many minutes to their lunch time. Another way you could get students to do community service is have them bring you a teacher note saying that you were doing community service and they would be rewarded with maybe a tardy or homework pass. They could also receive free candy bars or snacks and a drink. I think community service should be required at schools. It really does help. I think almost every student can find at least 30 minutes to spare during the week. Even if they can't there is always the weekend."
14519,0,"Dear Principle of my School, I realize that you have been wondering if you should require all students to perform community service. In this letter i am going to give my opinion on what i think. In my opinion, i think you should make all students perform some type of community service. I think this is a good idea so that students will be more involved in their community and so that our community will become a better one. First, i think this is a good idea because students will be more involved in their community. For example, if students all come together to work they will become more aware of their own homes. Students may even meet new people and get to know more people who live in the area. Second, this is also a good idea because our community will improve. With more people volunteering and helping our community will improve. One thing that could happen is our area will become cleaner. Because of this, there could be more people walking or more business. Lastly, i would like to explain that i also think that not every student should participate in certain community service. I think this because sometimes not all students may have time to help with bigger service. Some students may not even want to help. I think that we should only let people that are willing to help perform community service help with bigger projects. I hope that this letter means something and it is taken under consideration. Thanks, STUDENT_NAME"
2010,0,"People use cars everyday, but limiting car usage can be very beneficial. There are many advantages when limiting car usage. Limiting car usage can clear smog, reduce traffic, and it make people less stressed. Many people use cars, but that number has decreased over the last few years. There are many other ways to get to a place rather than using cars. We are now open to many options of transportation. Cars can be used, but there should be limits. Limiting car usage can clear pollution, particularly smog. For example,""Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions rom tailpipes""(Rosenthal). Cars are an impediment to the efforts of trying to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. With the limiting of car usage, those greenhouse gas emissions can surely decrease a lot. It will make the air healthier for people to live, and for future generations. Smog and greenhouse gas emissions can reduce greatly if cars have limited usage. Not using cars can make people happy,less stressed out, and relieved of tension. People don't have to worry about their cars, and paying for gas and other things when they don't use their cars. For instance,""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way""(Rosenthal). A woman is saying he is happier when he doesn't use his car. Another example is ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution""(Selsky). Both of those claims are very true. It does take away stress for him, while it reduces pollution. That's a win-win. With less stress and tension, people will be happier in their lives and there might be less problems in society. Limiting car usage can have really great impacts on people's happiness. Reducing the usage of cars can also reduce traffic, making it easier for other people that use cars. In France,""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital""(Duffer). 60 percent is a big amount of traffic. I'm pretty sure that that would satisfy alot of people. No traffic means less accidents, and less people worried about being late to school or work. Only a crazy person would actually want to be in traffic. There would also be less noise of cars, and more peaceful sounds. Limiting the usage of cars can guarantee the satisfaction of people that normally go through traffic, and those who don't like it. There are many reasons to limit the usage of cars because there are so many advantages. People will be less stressed and more happy, there will be less traffic, and the air will be less polluted with smog and greenhouse gas emissions. The possibilites are endless. It is very simple; less cars, more benefits. People need to realize that having cars may have some benefits when trying to get somewhere, but it makes more sense not to because there are so many advantages. Limited car usage can benefit people in many ways."
16125,0,"Dear TEACHER_NAME, I am all for requiring a B point average to participate in school activities (such as sports an other events). My main reason is that it would be the perfect incentive for students to maintain good grades because we all know children like to stay active and have a good time playing sports and participating in other events with their peers. My second reason is so by students working harder to get better grades means developing good study habits. which also means higher test scores. Lastly i would like to say students that maintain good grades would eventually end up getting into a good collage which means nicer jobs when they get older. someone against me might say its not fair because they're not as smart as the other children. My answer to that would be ""by taking away the sports and activities until you maintained a B average might be good for you, so that now you can spend more time on working to your highest potential.""

4031,0,"Students should be able to design their own summer project because, it give them a chance to have something to look forward to in the summer. Also it would help them get a chance at experiencing their own creativity. Students would be able to have that feeling that they are able to take on the responsibility. They would be able to learn more if they can designed it all on their own. For must students they dont really look forward to doing project but if you give them a chance to do it on their own they might get into it. First, designing your own project as a student it give you something to look forward to in the summer. Most students stay home for the summer with nothing to do. So, if you give a student a chance to design their own project for the summer it give them a chance to do something. Students would be able to explore more if they design their own project. With exploring their not sitting at home eating a bag of chips watching Netflix they are actually being active and moving around. Although, most teachers believes it is a bad idea for students to design they own project because they believe they will not take it seriously. It actually the opposite half of any schools in the world may have students who is into art or into designing things. It would give students a chance to express their own creativity. Most students love the thought of making their own projects. They would learn more and discover more with making their own project and designing it the way that they prefer it to be. Also, letting students design their won project would let them discover more. With discovering they are able to learn more and see thing that they never seen. Example say your in are and you art teacher give you a summer project. And that project is to take a pic of what you think expresses people in the world. You would have to get out your comfort zone to do that like going outside. it would also be a better way to communicate with people to gain information for your project. Furthermore, teachers would want for their students to take on that responsibility to prove that they are ready to work for their grade. It would also give kids the feeling that they are capable of taking on the responsibility of proving to there teacher next year that they are responsible. Kids have a hard time showing that they can do stuff in a responsible manner. So, giving kids that responsibility of designing their project it's letting them know that it is their job to make sure they have everything they need for the project and knowing that they are capable of doing that. It would teach kids that even though it is summer your still able to learn and have responsibilities. With that being said it is a good idea for kids to be able to design their own summer project because they are still learning. And they would have something to look forward to when summer comes. It would be a great way to experience their creativity. Also, students are able to prove to themselves and teacher that they are responsible. Letting students design their own project could give them a chance to discover and have a chance to express their own creativity."
4772,0,"Many schools require their students to complete summer projects, but are they given the freedom of making their own product? Some students would prefer to have their teacher assign them a certain project because they struggle to find something that interests them. However, most students prefer to come up with their own idea. Summer projects should be student-designed because it helps develop their work ethic, students can not copy off of other projects, and the final product will be more polished. Allowing students to design their own type of project would make them more interested in it, and help develop their work ethic. Everyone is interested in different subjects, and not everyone thinks the same way. Giving students the freedom of working on a project in which they find interesting will greatly increase their work ethic. It is crucial that students are developing their minds all year round. When students return to school, they feel like it is their first day of school in their lives. Providing students with the option of working on a project which interests them will make them more prepared for the start of the shcool year. The best students have a great work ethic. They are able to do alot of work for a long time. The more interested a student is in their work, the more they will want to do it. When teachers assign students work, it is very easy for them to copy ideas. Teachers will assign the same work to all their students, and the students will not do thier own work. When students copy off of other people, they are not gaining any skills, nor learning how to be independent. Allowing students to create their own projects will enhance their creativity, and encourage them to think outside the box. The purpose of school is help young kids find what interests them. No one wants to do something that does not interest them. Therefore, students will not do their own work. Students will do their own work if they are interested in the subject, and allowing them to create their own product is how to accomplish this.. Lastly, allowing students to design their own project will provide a better, more polished final product. It is very easy to create a project on something if the individual is familiar with the idea. The more interested someone is in a certain subject, the better the product will be. For example, it is difficult to write an essay on something that is unfamiliar, or not interesting. On the contrary, it is easy for an individual to write an essay on something that interestes them, or they know alot about. This idea can apply to almost anything, especially a school project. It is hard to find the drive to do schoolwork over summer, but it helps if students are allowed to choose their own assignment, and if students want to work on the project, their final product will be better. Their are many benefits to allowing students to create their own projects. Their product will be better, they will do it themselves, and it helps develop their work ethic. Finding ways to encourage students to complete their summer work can be challenging, but giving them the freedom of doing something they find interesting is the best way to create an incentive. Their are some benifits to teacher-assigned work, but enabling students to think for themselves is more important."
7508,0,"How many times have you wanted to stay after school for an extracurricular activity, but all of your friends went home? The principal is trying to publish a rule that says that you must participate in at least one after school activity, therefore you will always have a friend to talk to. The type of programs that the school will be providing will include participating in sports, the yearbook, or even being a part of the student council. There will also be a lot more fun and new activities introduced that you can enjoy independently or with a group of friends while staying after school. Participating in one or more extracurricular activities can also be good for your mental and physical health, by staying active and playing sports, or being a part of a club that requires socializing with new people. There are many extracurricular programs that can improve your physical health by participating in athletic activities, and help your mental health while doing enjoyable activities. Participating in at least one extracurricular activity can help a person so much more than you could imagine. Studies have shown that people that participate in school activities are known to be happier and more energetic in their every day lives, because of the great impact staying after school has on you. In 2017, a middle school in New York, had more than 25% of the students suffer from social anxiety. This school didn't give students the opportunity to stay after school until the year of 2019. Due to adding this opportunity, the social anxiety rates of the students were drastically decreased, because they were able to participate in an after school activity that helped them become more social and make friends easily. Staying after school will give you the opportunity to meet a lot of new people that might have the same interests as you, socialize with them, and become good friends in the future. Participating in an extracurricular activity can also benefit your grades and help you become more comfortable in your school's environment. There are a lot of interesting activities that the principal and the school board have come up with that have helped students perform better in school. Most of the academic clubs include being able to work on homework, study with a teacher, or turn in any missing work. The physical activities include, basketball, soccer, football, lacrosse, volleyball, and baseball. A lot of new clubs have been added from the previous years and multiple of them provide mind games and board games. A new club that the high schools in the county have started to provide is the video game club, which has shown to be the most popular one. The video game club will allow people to play the electronic games they like, while interacting with other people. The mind game club have helped multiple teachers figure out the way their students think and have helped them improve the way they teach to benefit the children's learning skills. A lot of the physical activities have also been statistically known for decreasing a child's depression rate, due to the interaction that kids have while participating in a physical extracurricular activity. Physical activities help the brain process things faster and more clearly, so the reason that the depression rates have started to decrease is because participating in sports brings joy to a person, and that has a greater impact on someone's mental health, than the physical health of a person. In conclusion, staying after school for at least one extracurricular activity, can be very fun and enjoyable, it can help improve your grades, and it can also help teachers understand the way their student's think. Staying after school can also make a drastic affect on your social life, help your physical health by participating in sports, and most importantly decrease social anxiety ratings. Being a part of the school's after school program will help you become more social and can help your mental and physical health by allowing you to be a part of so many different clubs."

The author isn't sugarcating anything for humans. My conclusion to this is that the author he is telling the truth despite the dangers like possibly dying before coming within two feet of the atomsphere that Venus is a worthy pursuit the only problem is how can we pursuit it if we have nothing that can make it past it. What the author does here is really let us know the dangers then explain why it's like that. That really helps because if i didn't have that i'd be confused out of my mind."
14055,0,"Dear principal, I think doing community service would be great. The reason why is because people who litter and don't pick there trash, up animals can get tangled in it. It also gets into our ocean and fish and other sea life creatures dies. The stuff that gets into the ocean and forest animals eat it, and the could get poisoned, and they could also die. It is also important to do community service because you can get rewarded like helping the elderly. It is also important because your doing good to your community, and helping others and animals. Cleaning up litter can do a lot of things to your community. For example people can come all over the United States to see the most cleanest community, and the town or city population will grow. The last good reason is that you could clean up your parks and your state parks. It is a very important reason you should keep your parks clean because people would not want to come to a park that is all dirty and probably stinky. Also people would not want to come to a state park that is popular that is gross and full of trash. So people has to clean up every where to keep states or probably the United states clean. One more thing it also important to clean up lakes and polluted areas so when people swim no bad stuff would happen. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME"
15915,0,"I do not participate in the sports and not very many activities so this does not really affect me. But this is still not very fair because the students grades are C's. The students do like the sports and activities but it is too hard for them to reach grades above a C. The students should be able to decide whether they need C's or B's and they will most likely choose C's. This change could help bring the students grades up but it also might not. If the change were to happen there is a 50% chance that the students will try to get B's. But there is a chance the students wont even try to get the B's. The students might decide to not even try to get grades unless the policy stays at the C grade average. The students will dislike the new policy very much so it is a good idea not to change it. If a majority of the students that try out for the sports, and the students that enter the activities already have B's then i would say go ahead and change the policy. but if a majority has C's the i would keep it the same. You, the principal, should try out the new policy for a month and if grades start going up to B's for the sports and activities keep the new policy, but if grades don't go up or they start going down change it back to the original policy. There should be a vote for the new policy and on the ballot the choices should be ""try the new policy for a month"" ""make the new policy perminent"" or ""not have the policy"""

The car isn't full capable of handling driving in a situation like that. The car lets the driver know when they should take over. So the question is "" If the car is driverless how come you have to take over in certain situations""? Why can't the car handle it all on its own since the car is smart? For the driverless cars to be very smart they need a bunch of sensors. My postion on driverless cars is I think they are a bad idea. They can't fully handle all situations. Also if the person behind the wheel is drunk or worse and they come upon a bad accident "" What will they do""? "" How will they act""? Since the car can't handle itself and the driver is incoherent I dont think the ending result will be very good at all.

It should not be required to do an extracurricular activity because not everyone has the time, some people like having free time and might not like doing extra things like that, and a lot of people are introverts but extracurricular activities force you to be social. Not everyone has enough time to do extracurricular activities. Most people have lives outside of school. They could be spending time with their friends doing fun things off of school grounds. They might also have non-school related activities going on that they are signed up for. For example: dance, gymnastics, or cotillion classes. People might also have family things going on. That could mean having to get a part time, after school job to help their family, babysitting younger siblings, and/or just helping out around the house a lot. There are lots of reasons someone wouldn't have enough time to participate in an extracurricular activity. People value their free time and might not enjoy having to do an extracurricular activity. When you are an adult you will most likely have to go to work most of the time. That means you won't be able to have that much free time and you should cherish the free time that you do have and a lot of people know that and do cherish it, but not always by participating in extracurricular activities. People also don't always enjoy doing extracurricular activities. They might prefer to do chores, sit around on electronics, or do service projects during their free time. People also like to have free time so that they are able to be free to hang out with their friends. If you are busy with an extracurricular activity then your friends might want to hang out and you won't be available even if you haven't hung out in a while. Like I said before, a lot of people value their free time a lot and don't always enjoy extracurricular activities. I am aware that people can be social. They like to talk to and be with people a lot. However, not everyone is social. They can be introverted and not like being around or talking to other people. Forcing them to do something social, such as participating in an extracurricular activity will do nothing but make them want to leave.

9020,0,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author supports his claim by stating that the reasoning for continuing research on how to get to Venus's surface is, because it was once very similar to earth's surface long ago. Astronomers claim that Venus probably had oceans and supported many different life forms just like Earth. The author states that the value of returning to Venus seems idisputable due to the fact that it is sometimes our nearest option. Since it is our nearest option and giving consideration to how long time frames of space travel are, this is a pretty good claim. So far the author's claims are, that it is our nearest option and it was once very much like Earth and habitable. The only problem now is Venus's surface conditons. On Venus's surface the temperatures average is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than it is on Earth. However the author goes on to state that NASA has a possible solution to the conditions on Venus's surface. NASA's possible soolution would be to have a blimp like vehicle hover 30 miles above Venus's surface. Even though the temperature would be around 170 degrees Fahrenheit it is still survivable for humans. However researchers cannot take samples of Venus's surface by hovering in a ship safely above the planet. The author states that instead of looking at the problems as risks we should look at them as challenges. The author claims that striviing to meet the challenges presented by Venus has value because human curiosity will likely lead us to many more equally intimidating endeavors. Also that our travels beyond Earth should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. So the authors claims for furthering research on how to get to Venus are, it's the nearest planet to us, it used to be very hospitable and much like Earth, and that we should see the risks as challenges and find ways to get past them. The author supported these claims very well."

Its a great option for students who have a hard time staying focused in school enviroments, suffer with a disability, or students who overall want a 'stright to the point' education. Online education is a great option and should be offered at more school disticts. Public school is a very distractive enviroment. Most students have a hard time staying focused with all the extra distractions like bullying, drama, and relationships. Thoughout my time in public school, I have often refused to go to school for a period of time because of these distractions. We are often getting told "" You come to school to learn' or ""dont care what your peers think"". It is unrealistic to put children and teens in a building for almost 7 hours a day and expect them to focus stricly in school and not build friendships or drama with other children. Online school is also a great option for students who stuffer with a disabiltiy. Not every child is fortunate enough to be going to school everyday for something beyond there control. Some children may have a serious disease that causes them to be in the hosbital or at home for a long period of time. Others might be suffering with depression, issues at home, or even a death in the family. Online school should be an open option for them because life is not fair to everyone. These events should not stop a student from reciving their education. Lastly, Some students would want a ""stright to the point education"". We often have teachers who get of topic and waste a lot of time in a unit. Teachers always stop the lesson over a child who misbehaves and keeps the whole class behind. They often slow down or go to fast to keep everyone a the same pace. It would be more benefitial have an education that goes in our own pace and not of the other students. We all learn at different paces and not all students learn the same. 13 years is way to long to learn basic education. Much of the material we learn in school is basically the same thing but slightly more materal added. For example, My core classes except math has not really changed much since the 8th grade and we learn the same things every year. This is especialy true in my english classes because I havent noticed anything new in the rubic since middle school. Overall distance school is a great option for students and has many benefits. It helps many students when public education is difficult for them. I hope that in the future, online schooling will be more accesable and a easier option for students."

Also if you chose (Policy #2) kids will try everything they can to have there phones in class. Policy #1 just seams like the right one because in my old school we had Policy #1 like yours and it worked out really well kids had phones out when there teachers allowed them, they hade them out before and after school, and they hade them during lunch. Phones are just one of the beast things kids could have in school they like to text and call each other and all those fun things you could do whit phones. If Policy #1 doesn't work out like it did in my other school then maybe you should see what parents think and maybe you could try what they say and if that doesn't work then Policy #2 will be useful. Phones are really helpful now in these days, I use my phone to get a hold of my parents. One of the questions you could have for me is that if its really important to get a hold of my parents then why not use the school phone? And my answer will be, ""I could but there is nothing like using you're own when you talk in the schools phone everyone is listening to you're conversation and that is a little uncomfortable and if our parents are at work then texting is the think you could just sent them a message!"" I hope you could see my point of view i have about phones in school if you have any questions or problems just talk to me about it I would be more then glad to have a good talk. By, Students Name"
16217,0,"Dear principle, I agree that it would be a great idea to only allow the B average or higher to participate in sports. It wouldn't be fair to reward the students who don't try in school and don't care if they do bad. Even if there are students who do try, it would give them a good opportunity to try and do better. There would be much more students working hard and getting better grades. It would be a much better chance to see what our school is really capable of. Parents and teachers would be very proud and students would feel confident. This would be a good way in showing how much the students improved. Lots, of students are lacking off and not paying attention from marking period to marking period. Having this new rule would be A goal to reach for every student who wants to join a sport. If more kids do good, friends of their's might try and do good as well. Every body will know that the students on sports have good grades and they would be like roll models to every one else. I know that this would be a great idea and that students would do much better in almost everything when they grow up. The ecomidy today, is doing really bad and we need better jobs to make more money. If people earn more money they would be able to stimulate the ecomidy much better. Sincerely, a student from SCHOOL_NAME."
24399,0,"The advent of widespread, fast, and reliable internet connectivity has enabled the creation of entirely new industries and collaborative efforts. However, in a world where millions of people earn their living sitting in front of a computer screen at home, it is surprising that the education system has largely failed to follow. Many classes already contain significant online elements which are able to be completed at any computer, yet schools still require students to complete that work on in-school devices. Students would greatly benefit from being able to attend classes online at home due to the improved work schedule, more relaxed learning environment, and potential health benefits. The most immediate benefits of online classes are related to the improved time schedule that they allow a student. With the current in-school system, students' class times are limited to the those set by the school in an attempt to best serve the huge variety of courses and needs of each student, all using the same bell schedule. Some students are inevitably ill-served by this uniform schedule, such as those that have other commitments late at night which cause them to lose out on sleep due to the early start times of school, or students that simply work better at certain times of the day. Additionally, different courses require different amounts of work, meaning that in the traditional block schedule, students may find themselves simply wasting time after completing their work for the remainder of one block, while they may be scrambling to finish their work by the end of another block. With online classes, students may also find that they can participate in daytime activities which they were previously either unable to attend while in school, or had to reserve for the weekends, having chosen to complete their classwork later in the day. Another benefit of an online course program is the potential for a more relaxed learning environment. The classroom is not always the ideal place to learn or work, and by removing the need for students to physically enter a school building, they are enabled to choose whichever place works best for them to complete their work, whether that be in the comfort of their home or the solitude of a public library. This can increase productivity by allowing students to move away from distractions and set up their work spaces however they wish. In addition to this, the ability to work anywhere could also help to reduce stress, a major problem for students, especially those at higher levels. This is the result of giving students the freedom to pick who, if anyone, they want to work with, reducing social pressures that many students are negatively affected by, and allowing them to work on a less strict time schedule. A final major perk of in-home learning is the potential health benefits for students. As they are, schools become breeding grounds for germs, as evidenced by the tremendous number of students who become sick each year during Flu season, or the waves of absences caused by a stomach bug. For many students, and even teachers, these illnesses would be entirely preventable, if they were not required to interact with hundreds of other people in close quarters, as would be the case if distance learning were implemented. This bonus would be especially helpful during outbreaks of rarer, stronger illnesses, such as the ongoing Coronavirus outbreak. Schools are under threat to be shut down during these outbreaks, causing major disruptions to student learning; disruptions that would be almost unnoticeable to students taking online courses. The internet is a powerful tool, which could easily allow many courses to convert to an online-only experience, eliminating the need for students to physically attend school. Were this to become a reality, the time, mental health, and physiological health benefits would greatly affect students, and enable a myriad of new opportunities."
4650,0,"Summer break, the break every student looks forward to. No school meaning sleeping in, no school work, late nights out, more adventures, but also forgetting most of what they learned in school. Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break but, they do not know if these projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. Although teachers have the best interests, if the students designed their own projects they could come to an agreement on what their projects would consist of. Students should be able to chose their own project design because it is likely the project will take up most of their summer and with this in mind they should also be having fun. Firstly, the students can come to an agreement of what each of their projects will consist of or if it is an individual design they can use their own creativity to design a project. By doing so there is a more likely chance the students will get their projects done. They wouldn't have to nag about doing something they have no interest in doing. These students would be able to express their interests in an academic way making the project easy to handle. Another thing to consider is, this project will most likely be worked on most of their break. During summer break a lot of traveling is done. If the student is aware they will be traveling they could chose to base their project on where they might be traveling. While a teacher might have the projects include items some students might not have access to, with the student's design they would be able to work with what they have. The students should not have to stress about getting the project done, rather having fun with it while on break. Lastly, the students should be able to have fun with this since it is their summer break. They could push themselves to try something new. Just how in the fifth grade science fair each student choose what their experiment was going to be. The kids had fun with the volcano explosion while learning that mixing baking soda and vinegar would make a bubbly explosion. They have fun while learning and who knows they might even find a new hobby. No student should have to worry about a school project during their peaceful summer break. On the other hand some schools worry that the students will forget what they learned or stop learning through out summer break. They have now required students to complete a summer project. Should this project be teacher-designed or student-designed? Students should be able to chose how they spend the majority of their summer break especially if its going to be academically."
11199,0,"I am for the use of the value of this technology being used in the classroom. I think it could help students perform better in the classroom. I think some people would find it weird or creepy that the computer could tell what their emotions are but I think it could help students and adults in school or in the workplace. It could help students perform better in school by making there work more fun or more entertaining for them. When students have to type a research paper they are always worried about how long the paper has to be or how hard of a project it will be. This can put pressure or stress on students. Students wouldn't have to worry about this if the computers could recognize their emotions. In paragraph six it says ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" "" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" If a computer could recognize that you are confused or bored and for it to act like a human instructor, then this would make class work a lot easier for students. If a student was confused about something and needed help but the teacher was already helping a student, the computer could recognize that you are confused and it could act like a human instructor, like it states in paragraph six, then the student wouldn't have to wait fo the teacher and he or she could get the help they need. This kind of technology could make work for students less boring. If a student has a research paper to type and is struggling to find information and then they start to get frustrated and bored because they can't find what they need. If a computer could reconize this, then it could possibly help the student find information. The computer could reconize that they are bored or struggling to find information and if the computer could somehow know what they are trying to research based on recent searches then it could pull up something similer to an add but with links to websits with information on what they are researching. The idea of having technology like this would be really useful to students. It could make class work easier and less boring for students. If a computer could read your facial expressions and could tell what your emotion is based off your expressions and then take that information to make lessons easier. I think it would be helpful to a lot of students. I think a lot of students would find this creepy at first but once they learn more about this I think it would be valued by many students. I think class work would be easier with this technology and that's why I am for the value of using this technology."
6569,0,"Soccer club. Art club. Drama club. The list goes on. These are all different extracurricular activities that almost all schools offer. Extracurricular activities can include anything from sports to bird watching, and they are all great ways to spend your time! For years, schools around the country have provided clubs and other extracurricular activities, so you should take advantage of that. All students should be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. First of all, taking part in an extracurricular activity helps students be more socially involved. According to Generic_Name, a guidance counselor at Generic_School, 96% of students that participated in one or more extracurricular activities have more friends. In other words, it is highly likely that a student will make a new friend or gain friends in an extracurricular activity that they participate in. Increasing the number of friends a student has would then make them more socially involved. Not only that, but participating in an extracurricular activity will increase a student's self-esteem. ""Students that have taken part in extracurricular activities show higher signs of happiness and self accomplishment,"" says Robert Hilton, a pediatric physiologist and expert in child behaviors. Put simply, students that have been in out-of-school activities are happier and appreciate themselves more. This means that if students were required to take part in extracurricular activities, they would all have increased self-esteems. Another reason is that students can find talent that helps them become successful. The Organization of Career Study, a group of people that help people study to get jobs, determined in a survey that 77% of employed people found the skills that they now use in their jobs from when they were part of extracurricular activities. Put simply, most people discovered the skills they need for work from extracurricular activities they participated in as children. If it was required for students to participate in out-of-school activities, many more people would find inner talents that could help them get a job some day. People who don't like extracurricular activities say that requiring students to join out-of-school activities deprives them of time after school to complete homework. Generic_Name, a mother of 5 kids that participate in extracurricular activities, says ""all 5 of my children come home from their after school activities at 6:00PM and have to be in bed by 7:30PM, leaving them only hour to eat dinner, take showers, complete their homework, and finish their chores."" Jameson is saying that her kids don't have enough time to do everything they have to do after school because of their participation in after school activities. However, students can still participate in extracurricular activities and have time after school for things such as homework and chores. The Virginia Directory of Public Schools, the group that runs and regulates all of Virginia's schools, published a study, determining that 90% of schools offer extracurricular activities not only after school but also before school. In other words, most schools give students the option for out-of-school activities both before school and after. Due to that, extracurricular activities do not deprive students of time to complete their homework after school. Ultimately, it should be required for students to take part in at minimum one extracurricular activity. Why? Participating in an out-of-school activity helps students become more socially involved, increases their self-esteems, and helps them find talent to become successful. If you're a student, participate in an extracurricular activity! If you're a teacher, start a new out-of-school club! It may seem small, but in the end, it might be what jump starts your future... or your whole life."
21614,0,"Dear Principal, I am writing you this letter to in form you that all cell phones at school must be abolished. letting students be able to use cell phones is a bad idea. If students are able to use their cell phones at school it will make room for distractions and detentions. In schools, 80% of students have cell phones. This many students using cell phones would permit a bad influence. For example, students suing cell phones at luch will be louder than usual, most likely up and about trying to get peoples numbers, and very likely to throw or try to damage other peoples phones. Also, kids who like to cause trouble, will most likely try to use their cell phone or not turn it off rite away at times when you are not aloud to use it. Having kids able to use cell phones will only add to distractions and safety hazards. Some might argue that letting students use their cell phones in school is a good idea because they would get to talk to their friends and be in better moods. However, students have plenty of social time already. They have their lunch periods, between classes, after school, and many teachers do give students some time to socialize with friends for at least a couple minutes. More time for students to socialize would be too much and they would not focus enough on their work. Therefore, letting students use their cell phones in school hours is unacceptable. In conclusion, cell phones in school hours would not be a good addition to school systems. Students using their phones would be a distraction to the learning environment. It would also influence bad behavior on students. Lastly, it would give students more social time, which would take away the students attention from their work. As you can see, cell phone use in school hours must be abolished. sincerely, STUDENT_NAME"
19004,0,"Have you ever wondered what the electoral college is? If you answered no I would say me to, but in this essay im going to explain why i am for it. I havent heard of the electoral college till now. So sit back and read this. I think that we should do the electoral college, so everyone has a say on who they want to be the state senate. Under the college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. While others might say no we need to get rid of the electoral college, because the senate might be bribing the voters, so he knows that he/she has their vote for sure. This is where it gets tricky. Alot of people might disagree with you because you have a different point of view than them, but it is ok if you disagree with them, because its your vote that counts. This might be what they say ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"". The biggest arguments are, because people say that one of the runners in the campaign did something they wasn't suppose to do. At the most basic level, The elctoral college is unfair to voters. That is probaly something you would say if you was against the electoral college. It's ok to go for what you believe in. You might get judged but who cares it's your opinion don't listen to them. I personally think that we should keep it. The Electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner. It's the electors that elect the president not the people. When your voting for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee. it's nearly impossible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Believe it or not its has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that's the first time since 1988. There is 5 reasons for retaining the electoral college despute its lack of democratic pedigree. It may have ripped some people off, but at least we got people as good presidents. You may not like them, but they have helped us over the years that we were in debt and need. Like right now the president's wife is helping the obese kids at school by putting in whole grains and healthier foods. Those are good reasons, but not as good as these. Certainty of out come. The reason is that winning candidate's share of the electoral college invariably exceeds more than enough. Because almost all the states award electoral votes on a winner take all basis, even a vey slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible. But the stakes are highly unlikely to happen. Everyone's President The electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. There is region that has enough electoral votes to elect a president. some people has no incentive to campaign heavily in the states that they are regionally favorited, becuse they will not gain any electoral votes by increasing their plurality. Swing States The winner take all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates. Voters in the toss up states are more likely to pay more attention to the campaign. So they know that they are going to know that they are deciding the election. They are also likely to be the most thoughtful voters. Big States The elctoral college restores somke of the weight in the political balance that large sates lose by virtue of the mal-appointment of the senate decreed in the constitution. The most popular vote in 2012 was by the state of Florida. Obama won that election with only 29 electoral votes. Bigger states get more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a smaller state does. Avoid Run Off Elections The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which the candidate recieves a majority of the votes by the cast. When neither of the candidates recieve majority vote it becomes more intense, because they start trying their hardest so they can win the election. Well there is the five reasons. It can be argued but only one will be victorious. Will we keep the electoral vote? Or will we get rid of it? So if i persuaded you to keep it pick, then keep if i didnt, then pick get rid of it. Which one will you choose."
10413,0,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author describes how a new technoloy called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. The new software has been developed that imroves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others. The software is the lastest innovation from the Prof. Thomas Huang of illinois, working in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam. Dr. Huanga and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans. In the fact these humans can perform this same impressive ""calcutation"" every day. LIke you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her/his face. The Mona Lisa can really really bring back a smile to her face. "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" Dr. Huamg predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Those were some of Dr. huang predicts. The computer can write some simple instructions that can make Mona Lisa smile with different emotions. While looking in the mirror: * Raise your lips at the corners of your mouth. * Then squint your eyes slightly, to produce wrinking at the coners of your eyes * Holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up, towards your eyes. In the fact, these are the instructions for a face that looks happy. Its all about those muscular action units. They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one. My conclusion, this new technology that Dr. Huamg is pretty amazing. This system or computer is a good thing it can make people smile and it can make Mona Lisa smile. It can also make the students smile or they can know what emotionl."

In the article I learned that the facial action coding system has many ways to process the human facial expressions. I also learned how they can be very valuable. In the text it states "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" This product could be really good for students classroom because if the student's face shows the computer that they don't understand something then the computer itself can pull of something help them out. Also another reason why this product can be valuable for students in a classroom is that it can teach them the importance of technology and why having technology can lead to better understanding on things. In the text it also states"" The same technology can make computer animated faces mor expressive for video games or video surgery."" This line right here tells us that is can lead to better things such as making faces with more expression. These are all the reasons why the facial action coding system is vauable for students in a classroom. It can show them the advance in technology and help them with things that express on their face. This is why this product will be vauable."
3684,0,"We as people get dumb, it's true, over a period of time we get dumber. To counter-act this problem schools started to assign projects over the summer to keep student learning. When I was in high school we had a huge summer break project, thankfully in my case it was a group project, but what was interesting is that our teacher asked if we, the students, design the project or if the teachers do. Some may believe that it would be better to let the students design these, but it's better if the teachers do because you will get good practice, you dont have to do work designing it, and it will help you in the future. One reason why teachers should design these summer projects is because you would get good practice. After a long break I sometimes have trouble getting the mindset ready to learn again, I often don't pay attention after a break because I am still in that kind of mind set. If teachers assign these projects, with their ideas, it would help me get ready for the school year. It is better for the teachers to design these instead of the students because they hand out good hard working projects, if students made these I fear they would make it too easy so they can get it over and done with. One other reason why teachers should design summer projects is because, well so they have to make it and we don't. I am going to be honest, nobody likes to do a summer project, they may be helpful but they are boring, so why should students waste more time designing the projects, then have to do the actual thing. It would be better for the teachers to make these so students don't waste more working time designing these. If teachers made the project then the students can give their full attention into completing it, not creating it. For example, when I had to do a summer project, I had the luxury of focusing only working on the project; while my friend, who goes to a different school, had to design their own. He told me that it was harder because he worked hard designing it and got really tired just from designing. One final reason why teachers should design summer projects is that it will help you in the long run. For me, I was one of the top workers because in my job they require you to work at all times, even during your breaks. Thanks to school, with my teacher giving me a summer project, since they designed the project, it was a good hard working one made my an adult. This helped me practice doing projects over breaks so I was able to do well in the future. Again, if students made this they would most likely make the projects easy. If students made things easy for themselves, it wont help them in the future. If their future job required them to work all the time, they would struggle at first because they made it too easy for themselves and their job would want them to do adult level work. Some might say that letting the students design summer projects is the right option; however, it is better to let the teachers make them because you would get good practice, you don't have to waste time designing the project, and it will help you in the future."
24646,0,"Many people can be in different situations. They can use trusted adults for opinions so they can make the best decision. Getting advice from different people can help a lot. For example, they can talk to their parents, guardians, friends, trusted adults, or even people you don't know! First of all, if a student wasn't at school for a couple of days and his or her friend was. The student can ask his or her friend for advice on what they missed or how to do the homework so they can make it up. The student may ask multiple people so he or she can get the best result. The student may be able to help other students that were also not at school on that day. Second, people on the streets could help too. If a person went on a trip to Hawaii and got lost, he or she can ask different people about the directions to their destination. He or she can ask, ""How do I get there?"" or ""What is the fastest route?"" They can put those answers together and get to their final destination easy and fast. Third, if someone is playing video games with their friend and doesn't know how to complete a challenge. They can ask their friend and the friend can help complete the challenge. He can give different way to do it or the easiest way to do it. After all the help he got from his friend, he could share with his other friends, and it would just keep on going until everyone knows. Last but not least, if someone went to the store to get groceries and wants the best price, he or she can ask the people who work there or other people at the store. They can also go to different stores and compare prices. They would not have everyone's opinions and can get the item they want at the best prices. This is how asking multiple people for advice can help you. The advice that has been learned can be passed on to other people so they can learn too. This is also a great way of communication!"
19921,0,doesw the electoral college work? yes the electoral college works cause it helps people get into a college that they would like to get into or want to it can make them happy and then later on in life they can make better choices to live free and get god jobs and have anice apartyment and other things of that sort much it is for the. ''under the electoral college systems voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors who in turn elect the president if you lived in texas for instance and wanted to vote for john kerry youd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to kerry on the off chance that those electors won the statewide. the electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the canidxent who recevies the most popular votes the winner the advocates of this potion. a dispute over the outcome opf an electoral college vote is pooible it happend in 2000 but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote the reasons is that the winning candidtes share of the electoral invaribly exceeds his share of the popular vote in election for example obama receievd 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes. cause most of the states awared electoral votes on a winner take basis even a very slight pluerality in a state landslide victory in that state a tie in the national nationwide vote is possible cause then total number of votes 538 is an even number but is highly likely.
24718,0,"Could you imagine only having one person to ask all your advice and questions to? I don't think I could ever imagine that because I believe that seeking multiple opinions for advice can best help a person to make the best choice. When I get multiple opinions I can get a different point of view on my choices, I can make sure the choice I am making is the best choice by learning from other people, and it makes me more open minded to things I haven't tired before. I do think that you also shouldn't just get your opinion from anyone, especially in today's society with social media, but I do think that having multiple opinions to come back to is truly important. When I get multiple opinions for advice I can get a different outlook and perspective of my own opinion at hand. I think that if I only asked the same person for advice I would become small minded and my actions would reflect that. My choices would always be influenced by that person and I would lack understanding of others. It also makes me realize things I never knew. For example, when I was doing course selections for high school this year I did not know what science class to take. The county and my science teacher do not support taking biology in freshman year; I, however, asked a friend of mine in high school what it was like since she was taking the class freshman year. She told me that it was not impossible, but just a lot of work you need to be committed to do. I am glad that I got another opinion from her because It helps me to realize that it isn't an impossible course to take which my teacher made me believe. I think getting different advice also gives you a diverse point of view of people and their lives. Another example I have is about my grandma. My grandparents grew up during a war and have different opinions on things than others. One thing my grandma hates to do is waste food. Always growing up I knew that I shouldn't waste food and if I was ever getting rid of old food, I should do it when grandma's not home. While at school though I notice that there are people who waste food and it's normal for them. The different opinions of people affect their values and lifestyle and I think it is important to understand them. Getting multiple opinions can help you to verify your choice is the best one. When I'm making a difficult choice I usually seek advice from those close to me. For example, when I was deciding whether or not to apply to TJ my mom's opinion was absolutely yes. I felt that this was my only choice until I told my grandma. My grandma told me that when my mom had went to TJ she had constantly been stressed. My grandma said that she did not want to push me to go to TJ and only go If I wanted to. Having more than my mom's advice was useful when I did end up deciding to apply because it made me aware of the choice I was making. When you get multiple opinions it bring up things you may have overlooked. When a doctor has a patient who has an issue that they are not sure what it is or the best way to treat them, they'll get a second opinion. Getting a second opinion from another doctor can help get the patient the best treatment for their particular situation or condition. One person alone could look over minor details that another person would not. My last point is that you may find the answer you were truly looking for. When my mom was looking into getting new floors, she did not just get one opinion. She went around and got different advice on the type of wood, style and color. She got multiple opinions until she got the choice that she truly loved and was happy with. I believe that getting different opinions can help to solidify the choice you are making as the best one you could choose. Getting more than one opinion makes you more open minded to things you haven't tried before. An example I have is when I went shopping with my friends. While we were shopping we picked out outfits for each other. I got to try on stuff I never would have chosen on my own or with my sister. I found things I absolutely loved that I would not have tried without their advice. When you get different opinions you also widen your option of choices to choose from. Five years ago when my family was getting my current dog, we went looking on pet websites. There was a pet store we always went to and decided to maybe get a puppy from there. It wasn't until we found out from our friends who had got a puppy from there that many dogs from that store get sick. It was basically a puppy mill. My mom went and found reviews for the store online. She found a review that said a certain breeding place in Maryland was the place to go instead. Taking that lady's advice we drove down to Maryland and got my dog who is still with me today. She is one of the best choices I have ever made and i'm grateful that we found her. I don't think that we would have went to this specific breeder without the advice from reviews and our friends. Getting different opinions can affect even more simple things in daily life. My example is ordering off a menu. As I get older, instead of just ordering the things my parents tell me to get, I may ask the waiter or a person who goes there often for their opinion on the best stuff there. This gets me to try new things and makes my meals more fun. Getting different opinions gives you more variety in life based on others' life experience. All in all, I still think that getting multiple opinions on different advice can help someone to make the best choice possible. When I seek different opinions I can get a different view on the topic, it makes me sure my choice is the best one by learning from others' stories and opinions. It also makes me more prone to trying new things. I think that you should always get advice from different people because they all have different experiences in life. I know that even in the future I will still want to have different opinions to be able to reflect and learn from."
3157,0,"Most schools in the United States require students to complete a summer project. Projects are assigned over the summer to assure students are learning over the long break. Most students want to enjoy their break without any school work and wait until the last week of summer break to complete summer projects. This is why summer projects should be student-designed. If summer projects are student-designed, students will be more creative, it gives students a senses of independence, and students will be able to explore areas of interest. However, some may disagree and say summer projects should be teacher-designed. They argue for this because if projects are student-designed they may off topic. This is a valid argument because it would make no sense if a student in a science class did a project about Fredrick Douglass. This could be avoided if teachers made guidelines for students to follow. Nevertheless, their are other view points to consider. On the other hand, if summer projects were student-designed they would be more creative. Students would not be restricted and could express themselves in unique ways. In the last few decades or so, the government has made standards for students to meet. With theses standards in places teachers have to follow a very strict curriculum. More than ever before, teachers are teaching to the test which limits student creativity. With student-designed summer projects, students can express their creativity which they are limited to in the school year. In addition, allowing summer projects to be student-designed would let students to feel independent. As most students are restricted during the school year to a classroom, allowing students to design their own projects could mean they go to a local park and explore their community. In Tara Westover's memoir Educated, as a young girl she did not explore her community as a child due to her parents beliefs. As she grew up she wanted to go to college and experience something new. When she went to college it was very rewarding. This is because she was not restricted any more. Allowing students to design their own project could be a very rewarding feeling for them because of the independence they gain through it. Finally, if summer projects were to be student-designed it would allow students to explore areas of interest that may not correlate to a specific subject in school. If a student wanted to do a project about fast fashion, it does not make sense to do it in a world history, algebra, biology or band class. That is why it is beneficial to students if they design their own summer project. A student-designed summer project allows students to research a topic they might not be able to do in their classes during the school year. To conclude, letting students to design their own summer project is beneficial in more than one way. Students will be able to show off creativity that they might not show off in school. Student-designed projects gives students a sense of independence because they are not being told what to do. It also allows student to explore topics that are not taught in school. Student-designed projects have many benefits and could even lead to a career path in the future."

My reason to join this program would be that evveryone should have a chance to do things that they can't do in a normal everyday life. This started a while back I was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank when my friend Don Reist invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat. I couldn't say no. I knew that it was an opportunity of a life time. I knew this because it isn't everyday that you can go out to sea and go to a different country. This was my only chance to help out and go to another place, but if I would have said no then I would have never of gone to Europe and I would still be at home working to jobs and not being able to do much of anything but work and work and work. At my first trip I wasn't at Europe until after I was 18 when this happened I could draft myself for the U.S. army and would be able to do this all of the time. When they got my draft they told me to keep doing what I was doing. What I was doing was feeding the animals. Then on my second trip I was on nightlook out. Every hour I had to check on the animals and make sur ethat there was nothing wrong with them. After a while it started to rain and I slid down the metal ledder and I cracked my ribs. But the best thing about this was that I could make my mark on the world. This is why I think that you should join the seagoing Cowboys."
18096,0,"Driverless cars are cars that will drive on its own, but they still need a driver right now for problems that happen and that needs a human, but are quickly become less reliant on humans for parts of the driving. Many different companies like Google and Volvo are making and testing driverless cars and there are some that we pass by everyday and we don't even know it. Driverless are a good thing for everyone, for example you are a busy person and have a long drive to work? Well you can work one that long drive getting mroe things done, and when the car needs your assistance, you are there. They can help the enviroment because they can find the shortest route to the place you are going by GPS. And car accidents will decrease by a large amount if everyone, or almost everyone, drove driverless. Right now all of Googles car haven't crashed once except when another human driver hit them. Also if someone is a long road trip by themselfs they will get tired, that is a big cause of car crashes, but if driverless cars then the driver won't have to drive the car while tired on major highways, also reducing accidents. If we adopted driverless then there would be a taxt/ride-sharing for everone, just say you need a car and one will come and pick you up. Another big casue of crashes and deaths if drinking and driving, but with driverless car it will keep people under the influence from driving on roads and making the roadways a safer place for everyone. As our lives keep advancing, so does technology, and this technology and help us learn, live better lifes, be safe, and so much more. And driverless cars are just part of this technology push. Cars are another step to making our lives better. Most rockets and other veichles that go into space that carry people, supplys, and other objects are mostly automated by computers. If a computer can take a veichle to Mars, Pluto, the Moon. Then why can't it take us down the street. As time advances driverless cars will get better and safer for everybody involed. So why hasen't the world adopted driverless cars for the better of everybody? If more money was put into the research and production of driverless cars then they would be even better and safer. All in all driverless cars are for the betterment of people and the advancement in technology. With more research going into driverless cars with big names behind it like, Google, Apple, Tesla, Volvo and more. Then why does it seem like the world isn't fully behind driverless cars yet. Once laws are passed and more driverless cars are put onto the roads the hopefully everyone can see why drivercars are good for the world and simply amazing."
24068,0,"Do you ever get tired of having to wake up so early every single morning, so you wouldnt be late for class? Being able to attend your classes from home, by taking them online or participating in class but through vidoechat will give you that option of getting up and catching the bus so you will be on time for class or to staying comfortable in your bed and still being all caught up on all the school assignments. Students should be able to catch up on any work missed or missing from any of their classes without having to stay after school or come during a free period to make up that work. So being able to do it online would encourage them to stay caught up more, especailly if that means they dont have to leave their beds or stay after school hours to complete make up work. Firstly having the sight of knowing you can easily catch up on anything that would of been missed in class since they were not able to make it then being able to make up those things online can lift so much weight off your shoulders. Worrying about waking up early so they wouldnt be late is unnecesary because they dont have to be at the school to finish or start the assignments needed they werent there to do with the rest of the class. For example if they were to miss the bus, and couldn't get a ride to school instead of just being absent and becoming very behind in the school work they woud be able to stay home and complete any missing assigments so by the time they were to get back to that class they would be all caught up and wouldnt have to worry abut finding another time including their free time to make those things up. This helps shows how much more convient using the technalogy to help us complete assignments can become very useful if students were allowed to attend classes online if there were a reason of being absent. My second reason why scholars should be able to participate in classes from home, is they wouldnt have to stress about attendence or being marked absent or missing the lesson which wouldnt put them behind in their assignments because there would be access to everthing one would need to stay on task and caught up on the computer. For instance missing one math class always makes you feel like you have been gone for a week so you tend to fall behind and become very confused in the lessons but if there were a way they could complete or make up everything that was missed or be able to learn the lesson that wasnt learned because of their absence like the video chat or online assignments or even a replay of the lesson then they would be able to catch up to schedule and also have a better understandment of the lesson that was missed. Therefor having these online classes as an option can be very helpful and can make being a succesful scholar not easier but more efficant and requires less of your energy, helps takes away just a little bit of the extraness highschool tends to bring especially when it comes to grades and assignments. My third reason is being able to stay home and attend to everything needed at the touch of a finger tip comes in handy when you really dislike or dont get along with the people you're required to be around in school whether it's the students or the teachers, because not only do they not have to see any of them but they dont have to interact or even make any type of contact with anyone because they will be at home and cathcing up or maybe even ahead in all assignments that the rest of the students might be in class struggling on. Like as an example if there were a group project and one couldnt cooperate in class with the group members that same student can stay home and complete whatever part of the group assignment that they couldnt seem to complete with the partner, because some people just might work better independently. This helps convey how much easier staying up to task and completing all school assignments could or can become if there was an option of being able to catch up from home without falling behind. Some would say that since they are not required to show up and they know for a fact attendence isnt a problem and being behind in late work is also not an issue, this can also encourage more students to not want to actually attend school. Knowing that not being present isnt going to make a difference and or effect grades gives you just another reason to stay right in bed after the alarm goes off for you to get up. For instance having the note in the back of your head that it is not a requirment to attend or even be in the building kids are most likely going to take advantage and stay home even if they arent catching up becuase just having the knowledge that they can be caught up in no time makes classes less of a priority. This explains how easy having the online classes would make it for students to skip and or be lazy with their school deadlines. But most say that being able to make up everything that has been missed can also encourage the people and students to want to be in school more so they wont have to worry about catchig up at home on the online classes, it can cause them to want to finsih eveything in class so there would be no reason for make ups. In conculsion from a students perspective being able to complete assignments like classwork, homework, and maybe even quizes or test can benefit more than enough people, and can become not just another but a more efficant way of highschools that requires less work and effort which results in so much more less stress and gives you energy to focus on other important things others might have going on in life like jobs, and sports, and family. Kids wouldnt have to wake up so ealry every moring, they wouldnt have to stress about attendence because it wouldnt be a requirment to be there and if they dislike the enviorment they wont even have to step foot on school property and will still graduate at the same time as their class. Which helps show how much more effcant and less stressful online classes can make our education."

"" Astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" There are also things being done to help be safe while gaining information on venus. "" Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying out of their way.

1076,0,"Phones & Driving If used correctly, driving with moderate phone use could be very helpful. GPS is the only thing that keeps the current generation on track. Of course, with all distractions that occur while driving, phone use can be detrimental, but without these devices, driving would be completely different. GPS is an amazingly useful tool. Many people find the option to have exact directions quite comforting, or even speaking to someone can kill some anxiety when driving. Going from one point to another has never been. Before this beautiful inventions called GPS, one would have to use an atlas or general directions, but now with the internet slowly becoming more and more essential, most GPS maps come with features such as a speed limit sign, just in case you missed one on the street or highway you're on. Not only that, but out is the day of calling to get traffic and accident information. Now is the day of real time information, quick rerouting and even small shortcuts not known by most. This ties in with the anxiety of driving in general. The constant fear of missing an exit, getting in a car wreck, and not making it on time. Speaking with someone, keeping a conversation, or even music played from the phone itself can ease that stress and make life much easier for the driver. Music has always been a universal way to calm one's self. Speaking to someone either about your anxiety or holding a civil conversation is also a very good way to calm down and focus easier and overall be more safe. Many advocates for the way things used to be will say that any use of the phone should be prohibited, that any use at all can cause a wreck. I completely agree, if used incorrectly, cell phones can be detrimental to whoever is on the road with you, but one thing some of these advocates don't think about is the amount of people who are safer due to their phone. Some insurance companies have apps which track and adjust rates based on the person's driving. If it weren't for GPS, many people would miss exits, swerve to get in their lane, and in general make dumb mistakes which could lead to more harm than good. In all, I believe texting, using social media, and constant use is bad for the driver, drivers around them. If you find the correct and safe way to use these devices while driving your vehicle, I do not see it fit to completely ban or prohibit the use of these everyday tools. Correct use is not life and death, correct use is making the time you have on this Earth easier. If you wish to be an advocate, look into what you're advocating for."
16839,0,"I am agaisnt the devlopment of these cars. What would be the point of having a driveless car thats not really driveless. I am agaisnt the devlopment of these cars because it would be very expanisve to fix, does most thngs a human can do and driving problems may occur. First, if the car was to break down and the sensors were messsed up it would be very expanisive to fix. According to the article, ""Totyota Prius uses position estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reciever and an interial motion sensor'. If you were to get into a bad car crash and wrecked the car and wanted to get it fixed it will be super expansive. Mainly because all though sensors are high tech and advanced. So basically your fixing the car and paying for all the technology it needs which is going to be alot of money. Secondly, the ""driveless"" car does mainly what humans can do theirselves. In the article it says after all the listed sensors, "" The combination of all this input is neccessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel"". It also says later in the article, ""They can steer, accelertae, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents"". If this ""driverless"" car can do what humans can do themselves then what is the point of making the car. Ecspically not if the car isnt really driving. Someone would pay all this money to do something they could have done themselves. Lastly, with this ""driverless"" car driving problems may occur. technology does crash and does disfuction and may move faster than us. In the article it says, ""even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault the driver or manufactuer?"" The article makes a valid point. If those cars a developed those type of questions will need to be answered and conflict will occur. Technology can cause an accidnet just as easily as a human can but if that happens who is at fault? How would the situation be handled? In conclusion, I am agaisnt the developmnent of ""driveless"" cars. For the three reasons listed and more. ""Driveless"" cars are expanisive to fix, does most things a human can do and can cause more problems."
6541,0,Extracurricular Activity Yes I agree that all student must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. There is three reason one is it can help you communicate better with other people around you. Also you learn something and hard work and it is good for the school in many ways. First reason is communicate it can help in many ways. Like it can help you put yourself out there. For ex it can give yourself confident to show who you really are. As well it will let you meet other people or possibly make a new friend. Also help you see what kind skill you might have for your future. That is the first reason why communicate is helpful in the extracurricular activity. The second reason is that help you learn new thing. That you may have never seen before and it can show hard work. One of the extracurricular activity is sports like basketball. One thing it can teach you to be a leader and a good team player. The other extracurricular are the yearbook and the serve on the student council. The extracurricular activity can help your education. By helping you learn how to count money and take photo and put data on the computer. At the end extracurricular activity can help your mind set grow even after school. Your mind is grow every single day this just makes it grow faster. The finally reason it is good for the school in many ways here are some ways. It can help school rise money and school spirit. For ex this year the school wear pink to support this girl who had cancer. That is how extracurricular activity. To help people like her. Also the extracurricular activity helps you not be lazy and just stay home and eat all day or night. It can get you out of the house for a while. The last thing is you can be on the basketball team and it can make your team pound or if you just what to have fun you can also do that. We help the school by doing extracurricular activity we don't even know it. In conclusion those are the reason why I said that all student must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. There is something for everyone. What extracurricular activity would you do? Also that is all of my reasoning of why I agree on extracurricular activity.
7916,0,"Not every student has the time for extracurricular activity classes. If the principle dose decides to have students do extracurricular activity classes then it should not be counted as a grade. I think this because most students have other classes, grades, and homework to worry about. If the principal require a extracurricular activity classes then students might become stressed. First, students already have a choice in which related art class they want to take. Even though it is a choice it is still marked as a grade. Related art classes is like a break from class. If the principal requires you extracurricular activity classes then thats taking time from students learning. Second, feel like students would not have enough learning time in school if extracurricular activity classes gets added to our school hours. Then it might be too much pressure on students and that can effects a students learning. Teachers need time to teach and students need the time to process what they are learning. Some students need more class time to do work therefore extracurricular activity classes might not be the best choice. Lastly, some students might not be interested in taking extracurricular activity classes. Students might not be interested because they might not have the time for it. Most students will not try in something they are not interested in and some students are not interested. If teachers count this class as a grade then grades might go down because how many classes is taken in a day. In conclusion, I think all students should have a choice to take extracurricular activityclasses. Not all students have the time or interest to take the class. Will you make your students take this class if you were a principle."
15506,0,"Dear Principal, As a member of the student body, I would like to talk to you and express my feelings on you changing the policy to participate in sports or other activities to having a grade B average. Many of our student have a C average, and changing the policy would mean that they wouldn't be allowed to participate in sports or other activities. I think this policy would be unfair. Not only would we have smaller participation in sports activities, but also in school activities. Our sport's teams would fall in numbers and our school functions would be lame and boring, because attendance would be down. So why not change the policy to at least a grade C average? I think this would be more fair to all the students. It would push the students below a C average to achieve something more and improve their grade, and the students above a C average to maintain or slightly improve their grade. Making the requirement a C average to participate in sports and school activities could also help our school to become academically sound. Making it a B average could do the opposite. Students who have C' s and D' s would feel discouraged and just give up there for dropping are school's average grades really low. We don't want this to happen, so instead of making it a B average let's make it a C average! Mr. Principal I sincerely hope you will take into consideration all that I have expressed to you. Sincerely, A member of your student body"
10731,0,"In this article they are talking about a way calculate our emothins called FACS. Prof. Thomas Huang is the creater of this technology with of course some other people. It is a highly advanced mood ring of sourts but intead of just guessing, it makes a 3D model of you face that allows it to calculate what you feeling. Thomas Huang paired with an psycholgists to determin the different signs of emotion so he would be able to prepare the machine. This idea could change the way we learn today;we realy on our technology so much today kids now day do the bare minimum to pass. Most of the pappers we do we are googling the awnsers. It is about time we find a way to teach the future gerenation. If we had this kind of technology scanning us and being able to tell when the kids do not uderstand what they are being taught it could possibly boost our learning and help better us for the future. I know from expersience that if I am not aware of what I am being taught I will just look up the awnsers or find someone who already did it. This may just make us get the upper hand in our nation on learning. As we sit today I really do not know how future generation will ever make it heck I do not know if we will. Yes this way of using FACS is a little creepy and it may be a violtinon of our right but really we have no right till about 21 years of age. So lets get this stuff up and running allow our future generation to learn better and not have to cheat when things get tough. What may also help is if we throw a tutor in there to help when they notice when we dont't understand something."
25667,0,"Were you ever in a situation where you didn't know what to do, so you asked for someone else's advice and or opinion? If so, did you seek the opinions of multiple people or just one person, and do you think seeking the opinions of multiple people could help someone make a better choice? I believe seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because you get to know about different peoples experiences, you know about more possible outcomes, and you gain more knowledge about the whole situation. Asking multiple people for their opinions or advice will benefit you more than just asking one person. I think asking more people about a decision you're making will help you make a better choice because maybe they were all in the same situation as you, and they could all offer advice that will help you in different ways. Different people will give you different pieces of advice based on their personal experiences, and it may not be the same for everyone. You will also be able to hear about more peoples experience's, which should help you be more prepared to make a choice. Before I started middle school, I asked my older cousins and friends about which classes they recommend. I listened to multiple peoples opinions, and decided which classes I should take. I couldn't take all the classes everyone recommended, so I took the classes that more than one person recommended because they had similar experience's that were all good. Listening to different peoples opinions and experiences will inform you about more possible outcomes. Everyone that offers you advice could tell you something totally different, and that just tells you about how many possible outcomes you should be prepared for. Before a big test I ask my friends that have already taken it about how it went, and if they think I should prepare more by studying a certain topic. If my friends scores surprise me then I can infer that the test was either very hard or very easy. Asking more than one friend will also help me make a better choice on whether I should study a certain topic or not. Seeking someone else's opinion will also help you gain more knowledge on things you might not know much about, but seeking multiple people's opinions will help you gain even more knowledge than one person alone could provide you. Having all that extra knowledge should definitely help someone make a better choice. Before my cousin went to college she asked many people on what major they recommended for her. Many people told her about their majors', and how it went for them. Since she asked so many people for their opinions it helped her learn more about different majors, so she could make a better choice about what major would be best for her. It just makes more sense to me for people to seek the opinions of multiple people to help them make a better decision. I believe seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because you get to know about different peoples experiences, you know about more possible outcomes, and you gain more knowledge about the whole situation. It also never hurts to ask people for their opinion, and if you want to make the best choice possible it's best to ask different people for their advice."
15395,0,"Dear Principal, As an Eighth Grade student I feel that sports should be allowed to all students. Knowing that the students usually get C' s, you should let them be included in sports. I think that kid's should get at least a B in classes, but saying they cannot participate in sports makes them feel left out. Some kids are better at academics than sports and others are better at athletics. By having students involved in sports, I think it will have them feel better about themselves. If they feel better about themselves, they can possibly get better grades. I feel an adjustment to the rule can be students can start with a C average but if they can't bring up their grade by the third week of sports, they should be kicked off of the team. Students should also be allowed to participate in other activities such as Student Government, Writing Club, and Drama. Again, some students are amazing in these fields and they won't be able to prove that if they have lower than a B. I personally know many talented people who don't do a good job in school, but excel at music, writing, and art. I am not disagreeing with you that a good education is not important, but sports and activities can help kids get more out of school. I also feel that these sports and activities can be an escape for some people. Some play football to let go of their anger and others write to express themselves. Personally, I play sports to relax and write music in a way to let all my feelings out on paper. I am not alone in doing this. By telling students they need at least a B average, you are not letting them show what they are fully capable of. I am asking you to please take this letter into consideration. You may agree or disagree with this letter but this is coming from the eyes of a student that cares about their peers. Thank you for reading this letter. Sincerely, An Eighth Grade Student"
20849,0,"February 16th, 2011 Dear principal, I am student going to this school and I believe policy one is the best choice out of the two policies. I think the students and I need to be able to use cell phones in school during lunch and free time. The reason why I say that is because cell phones are becoming more and more put into daily life then we realise. In most big companies they have cell phone conferences when they can't get everyone in the same room at the same time. Also if you have to send out emails or news really fast and you don't have a computer nearby then you have to use a cell phone so that everyone knows what is going to happen or what is happening. As you can see we are becoming more and more dependent on cell phones and if you take that away from us we won't have that advantage to be ahead of some places in the world. Another thing you could add on is how we could involve it in classes. For example if we need to vote then we could send a text to a certain number and then we would have a class discussion on it. If you get rid of that then what would happen when we have to text or send something important? Honestly we wouldn't know how to do it because we could only use it after school which is mostly around 3-4 hours if you were to include activities and how long it takes to get home. In my honest opinion I think we should embrace the new age and make it into something where we can learn from it. That way we can still use it during school and we will still learn science and math. I believe that we can make the cell phone be part of school if we would try hard enough because I am pretty sure mostly half the kids at school have a cell phone. So I hope you choose policy one and maybe expand off of that to incorporate it into something we could use in class. From, STUDENT_NAME"
6852,0,"Think about your future, for example your dream collage. Don't you think that they would love see different activities you have done during your past year. To see if you are type of person they want to be at their school. I agree that participating in an extracurricular activity is a good detection to make. I believe extracurricular activity can help them get into a good college. First doing a sport can help. Colleges love to see really good students you are dedicated to a certain sport. Which they would love for them to join their school cause of how good of a player they are. Secondly voluteering is another good reason. Colleges love to see when kids take the time out of their day to help those in need. Therefore if they take an activity involving voluteering it can help them get into the college they prefer. Lastly taking a student council or being a leader in some activity. Colleges have to determined if you are right for the college. Taking an activity that shows your leadership and hard working are amazing traits to be shown in a person. Sports, volunteering, showing leadership are the reasons why I think it is great for college applications. Its a great way for you to interact. You could make new friends. Firstly when you participate in activity it is a great way to meet new people and become friends with someone who share the same interest. Secondly you are able to learn new things. Whatever activity you participate in, you would mostly learn something new. Therefore it could help you in the near future. Lastly it can change you as a person. When you are around new people and you learn their differences, you could change as a person and see the beauty between other. Making new friends, learning something new, and changing you as a person are reasons why extracurricular activities are great for interacting. I agree that students should take extracurricular activities. It being great for college and great way of interacting are the reasons why I think so. Taking the time out of your day and doing something new can never hurt anyone."
12554,0,"Do you think theres a real alien artifact on mars? Well if you do, im sorry but there isn't. Even thoe ""the Face on Mars"" may look like an alien artifact, is just a natural land form. There are many of these in Cydonia and they're called Martian mesas. This Martian messa looks as if it's a face because of its unusual shadows that creat the illusion of eyes, a nose and a mouth. In April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michale Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took a picture, that is 10 times sharper than the orignal one tooken by Viking 1, of the face on mars. This picture finally revield that there was no face on mars, but a natural landform. This didn't satisfi many people. They thought the alien markings where hidden by a haze, since that was the time of year where that part of mars gets clody. So on April 8, 2001, a cloudless summer day in Cydonia, Mars Global Surveyor took a final look. Then, when they finally found it Malins team captured an extraordinary photo using the cameras absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. What this thing actually is is "" the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa"" which are landforms common around the American West. This was simply a chance for NASA to get a little money."
23633,0,"My mother always said, ""You will never learn if you stay at home, go to school to learn more things."" Math, English, history, and science are some classes that students need to learn. If students take classes from home, then student will not learn so they will not benefit from it. Students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because student will gain less exercise, students will get less social communication, and student will be less focus. Many claim, students will benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because they will feel more comparable. However,students will not learn anything even if they feel more comparable at home. Clearly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home. To begin, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because students will gain less exercise. For example, Generic_Name, who attend classes at home before, said that he will get less exercise, now that he goes to school he gets more exercise than before. To further detail, two friends, Generic_Name and Generic_Name, both attend classes at home before, they would both say that they would gain very little exercise before going to school. Clearly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because students will gain less exercise. Additionally,students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because students will get less social communication. For example, Generic_Name, a girl who use to attend classes at home, would not communicate much with other students at first, after some time she is able to communicate with other students. To further detail, Generic_Name, would talk very little to other students because he use to take classes at home, after a while he would talk to other students. Clearly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because students will get less social communication. Lastly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because student will be less focus. For example, Generic_Name,a student who attend classes at home, had to difficult time focusing on the lesson at home, some later she began to understand the lessons. To further detail, Generic_Name had a terrible time focusing on the lessons when he toke classes home, he said that his surrounding was very distracting. Clearly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes from at because student will be less focus. To concluded, student will gain less exercise, have less communication experience, and will be less focus on lessons are reasons why students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home. These three argument state why students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes from home. If students attend classes at home then student will not learn a home. There is one option: students should not attend classes at home."
25617,0,"Did you know that when people look for opinions they look for advice? In the prompt it states that seeking multiple opinions when seeking for advice can help make a better choice. I agree with this statement because of choices, opinions, and the point of view of this prompt. First, the point of view. persons point of view, the opinions you get from the people is their opinions but sometimes the person whos asking for advice will have to go to another to get their point of view. Depends on situation, the point of view really depends on how and what your situation is, like lets say they are in a fight with their best friend and they go to there parents for help, the mom might just say to talk to her and their dad might say dont talk to her anymore. Many different choices, before the person chooses they usually gets points of views from other people for advice some of these choices can be tricky to choose from. Next, opinions, the point of view, this person who is looking for some advice. The opinions really depend on the persons point of view. different opinions, opinions can be tricky some opinions are a lot of different then others. Seeking opinions, opinions are the point of view towards the choice this person is about to make so sometimes people ask more than one person to get a different point of view. Finally, choices, hard choices, choices can be a whole lot better when you seek different opinions from other people. Like lets say the person has a choice between their best friend and their new friend they get along with so well, this choice is very hard to choose from. Many choices, choices can come in many different ways like lets say one person has a choice to eat pizza, pasta, or eat a salad they have more then two choices and they are only aloud too choose one. When one person is looking for advice on a choice one will usually would go with the opinions that work the best for his or her choice. It really doesnt matter what they choose it only matters what the opinion, and situation, or the choice this person is in. Seeking multiple opinions when seeking for advice can help make a better choice. I agree with this prompt because of the point of view, the opinions, and finally the choices. Opinions and choices happen in our everyday lives."
3858,0,Schools are always going to find different ways to excel in student learning. The schools are going to give out summer projects to the students to help them learn while they are on summer break. The summer project should be designed by the teachers because students would learn more from teacher designed projects and so that the students dont pick a topic for their project that they have already learned about. The students would learn alot more if the teachers were to design the projects. The teachers have a better understanding of how to design the projects. The students may have a hard time designing the project with out the teachers help. The teacher overall has way more experience to design the project than the students would. Teachers could utilize all class topics on the summer project for students to pick. They have all the topics utilized so that they can assure that the students will learned something over the summer. The students will be able to learn all the topics over the summer with the teacher designed project. The teacher designed project would be better so that the students do not pick an irrelevent topic or a poor project outline. If the teachers let the students design the project then the sudents may choose a topic unrelated to the class. The project would not be teaching the students what they need to learn. The student may also create a poor project outline. The poor outline would be unacceptable and would not be able to grade. the poor outline would keep the student from learning important information on the topic. If the schools pick the teacher designed project it will be better for the students because the students would learn more from it and so the students dont pick an irrelevant topic. The teacher designed project will help students succeed and provide them with better learning experiences.
13319,0,"You may have thought the Face was created by aliens. It could be a possibility, but think of the research and observations of the scientists. You can't just predict something and think of a conclusion. You must go through a process of research and examinations. The scientists researched and examined the Face and was just another Martian mesa that was around Cydonia. First of all, the image did have characteristics of a face. The text stated ""a few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a ""huge rock formation..which resembles a human head....formed by shawdos giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" The Face could simply have been the shadow of something or the lighting that caused it to look that way. ""Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in September 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended."" The photograph from the Viking could have been a worse quality than now. Secondly, the photograph that was captured in 1998 is more reliable and more efficient than the other one. This picture has a more clear view and is better to observe. ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camer (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousand of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing....a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" The landform could have been created from erosion or weathering or even different types of weather or climate. In fact, maybe a closer view could have looked a different shape. Furthermore, there was another shot taken in 2001. With an even better camera quality, which showed different types of shapes or objects, other than a face. In the text it said ""On April 8, 2001, a cloudless summer day in Cydonia, Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look."" Garvin stated ""We had to roll the spacecrafts 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" The pixels having a better quality made the observation even better. The camera could even make the objects 3 times bigger. ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, he added. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" They were trying to say that if it was created by aliens they could have been able to tell because of its texture or shape. In conclusion, the Face was not created by aliens, it is just a natural landform. The Viking photo made it look like it was created by an alien because of its structure and the way it was formed and shaped and it was only because of the quality of the picture that made it seem like it was. With the more recent pictures and 10 times better quality made the scientists come to a conclusion that it was just a structure. ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West."" Garvin stated ""It remind me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about that same height as the Face on Mars."""
14441,0,"1-27-11 Dear TEACHER_NAME, I think it would be a really good idea if you required all of the students here at SCHOOL_NAME to participate in community service. It teaches kids responsibility, and gives them a sense of purpose. At first it may seem like a chore, however, I'm sure that after a while most of us will come to enjoy helping others in the community. Many of the clubs at school already require community service. For example, National Junior Honor Society, Student Council, Young Ladies of Distinction all require community service, and still others such as Students for Christ certainly encourage community service. The types of students that are in these clubs that require community service are usually the kids that also behave well in class, get reasonably good grades, and don't get into much trouble outside of school. Isn't this how you would like all students at SCHOOL_NAME to behave? It certainly sounds nice to me. Some private high schools in our area require community service to graduate. Many more clubs in the public high schools require community service hours than here at the middle school level. Requiring community service now would prepare all of us for the future and teach us how to be good citizens. It would also help keep the trouble makers out of trouble. If you required community service hours to be completed in order to play sports, stay after school, join certain clubs, or, your personal favorite, you could keep our report cards until we finished the hours, then, we would all have to spend at least some of our free time completing the assigned community service hours and not doing things to get in trouble. Over time, the hours we spend helping others might become one of our favorite things to do. It might give us a sense of pride for doing something useful for someone else instead of just sitting around, wasting away in front of the TV. Please consider my thoughts when you make your decision on whether or not to require community service hours for our school. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME"
2303,0,"In Germany, Life has been going on without cars for years. Street parking, driveways and home garages have been generally forbidden in this experimental new district they have going on. Vauban's streets are completely ""car-free"" -except for a few streets on one edge of the community. Vauban's families usually do not own cars, and some sell their cars to move. Vauban, completed in 2006, the united states was seperating the suburban life from auto use, as a component of the movement that is called ""smart-planning."" Gas emissions are huge to current efforts to make cities denser, and better for walking but these basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make public transportation more accessible. Experts expect public transport to be much larger in a new federal transportation bill. Unlike Paris, Paris is banning driving to clear the air of the global city. People were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a fine. A lot of drivers were fined. Beijing, China were both known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. Diesel was blamed, since France has tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Paris typically has more smog than any other capitals. Because of the smog public transit was free of charge. Bogota on the other hand had a car-free day. Millions hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during this car-free day. This car-free day devoided traffic jams. The goal for this event was to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines. Car-free day turned out to be large. Even rain did'nt stop people from participating in this event. Car-free day is also a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. Cali and Valledupar joined the event for the first time. Other countries came to see this event. These people who invented a car-free day are generating a revolutionary change to today's world. The day without cars is part of an improvement in Bogota in the mid-1990's. In today's world, President Obama has ambitious goals to shift in American behavior. America's love affair with it's vehicles seems to be slowing down by population growth. The internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet new friends. Cellphones and car-pooling has been more flexible. Pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commerical and public transportation are woven to connect network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety. With all these changes, it all reflects to new priorites across the nation to fellow citizens to limit car usage in the future."
2342,0,Based on what i read i think that limiting car usage is a great idea. Two reasons why i think its a good idea also is because it will help our envieroment and less accidents and deaths. Now its possible that some countrys already have no cars period but we may need some cars and any type of vehicle because we need some kind of transportation because we can't always walk it will eventually hurt us to walk always. Like it says in source 1 paragraph 2 in vaubans streets its completly car free that means that there most be no accidents at all amd less traffic for them. Here in florida we have many vehicles and need them but it would be something different to not have them and maybe have less accidents and help our enviroment too because if u think about it we sometimes leave our cars turned on and that destroys the enviroment that we live in. I myself prefer to have vehicles because its better because its resourcefull and easier to travel.
19134,0,"I think that we should change it to populure vote, as in like who ever gets the most votes, but on a national scale, not on a state scale. why? well I realy would have to agree that an even number could cause a tie. Even if the tie was settled by the congress and senate there could be major problems. like for example lets just say that the last election was a tie, the out come of the tie would be Romney as president ( whitch would be good) and Joe Biden as vice president ( realy bad). and the reason this could be very bad, because of the fact that the two of them have very diferent opinions the two of them would probably be so busy arguing that they wouldn't get anything done, plus Joe would constantly be trying to get Romney impeached. My second reason is becuse yes one of the guys who puts in our votes could put it in incorectly because of the fact that somone could simply bribe him or her to do so. The scary thought is that if one person does it and gets away with it then every one with lots of money will try, just like someone could try and bribe me to tell them what this test is on ( i wouldn't say unless it was well over $200 but no one I know has that much they would want to spend on a test so nobody has tried to bribe me). So now my third reason is it would be prety cool to know that the next president could be decided by a single vote but that is even more unlikely than a tie with our current system. But it would be more likely that it could come down to a more probable minimum of around a milion. Now that I have covered my three reasons I hope you have gained a more valuable view of our presidential election system and that will consider more carefully on what you will choose."

There have been people who dislike what NASA had to say about this picture, because at the beggingn NASA didnt know what it was for a fact. NASA started focusing on this more and more. as it says in the article ""Its not easy to target Cydonia, says Garvin."" Well they beggingned to take a photo of this object every year and the more they study on it the more it came to there minds that it wasnt a face and had to be something else. Many scienctists were taking a shot and believing the face was an alien artifact. Well as this got more interesting and popular to the world NASA had one day many years later, found out that this Face that people were saying it was had been a landform. In the article it states ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West."" This proves that NASA has proof for this picture, that the people that had been disagreeing with NASA can no longer disagree because of what NASA put in for this to be proved it wasnt a face."

Ms. Breadwill here to do an interview with Mrs. Backbone, because she thinks ""Unmasking the Face in Mars"" was made by aliens.

Mrs. Backbone simpliy sighed and said "" Can we move on to the last question?"" Mrs. Backbone had one more question, and i was hoping it wasn't too hard since I have been answering all her questions correctly. Mrs. Backbone said, "" the Face is not a natural landform and I still believe there is an alien monument. I sighed and told her she was wrong once again. She yelled "" How?!""

1619,0,"The world of cars is rapidily changing due to their emission of greenhouse gases. These gases not only are warming the globe as a whole but are more locally effecting the quality of air in our cities. Efforts are being made to lower the amount of gases and improve air quality such as Car-free day in Colombia and bans on driving in Paris. For Colombia the city of Bogota has built bike roads and nice sidewalks to limit the need or want to drive and ultimitely reduce smog. During their last year millions of people walked on their car-free day even when it rained showing that people want to make a difference and positively help their enviroment. In some areas like Paris where pollutants are at 147 micrograms per cubic meter drastic actions had to made during its peak on smog. The city of Paris put a partial ban on driving reducing the smog by 60 percent. Some communities like Vauban, Germany have created car free suburbs and building lifestyle around that. Instead of large suburbs like we have here in the States they have focused on making shopping within walking distance. People of Vauban have been reported to being less stressed and more happy after living in a car free community. However; this is not the most practical here efforts can be made to redesign how we live such as making super markets easier to access on an everyday basis and only buying the groceries that you need for a couple of days instead of a week or two. This trend has brought people from all over Germany to live there and has set a trend changing how other communites live there lifestyle. Giving up cars has can build a better life for you and the planet by reducing pollution and lowering your stress but it in order for its full benefits it needs to be done as a community."

It's the type of planet that people don't want to examine or not even explore. Even though,Venus is really simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth for the ones that like to stargaze. The article mainly talks about on how others would see the planet ""Venus,"" I see the ""Evening Star "" as a the brighest of the planets of the whole entire galaxy along with the Sun(Itself). To me, I also thought that the Sun was just another type of planet,but it wasn't. Turns out the Sun was the ""Biggest Star of the Galaxy."" Let's not forget that Venus is often referred to as the Earth's ""twin."" Because Venus is after all the closest to the Planet Earth.

16527,0,"Dear Principal, I think that you are right. Sports should be a privilege to the students that work hard every day and have a B average. I think that sports should not be apart of schools with young students because most students focus to much on sports and really the only thing that you need to focus on is your education. Most schools require a D and if you get an F you have to and talk to that teacher and try to get your grade up to a D at lease. Plus I think that your teachers have to get a weekly report to your coach about your behaiovr and concerns in the class room. When I played football I kept my grades up to Bs and As because my parents were really strict about me playing sports. They wanted me to foucs on my grades more and if I couldn't get my homework done then I had to quit. Education is way easier to get a job with than sports. 1 of every 25 college football players makes it in to the NFL or the National Football Leage. I know that if I was the principal of a school, you would at lease have to have a B average with some As. So yes I think that you have to have a B average to play sports or do other activity's."
2811,0,"The advantages of limiting car usage is that less gas is released, thus causing a steady, more healthier Earth. Limiting cars is completely world changing. Although most people arent in favor of the cause, they dont know the real effects of the gas that is produced by cars around the world. The gasses that are released from cars are very hazardous to the ozone, and can cause environmental changes if too much gas is released. For example in Paris, they had a almost near-record pollution buildup, and since diesel is popular in France because of a tax policy that favors diesel over standard gasoline, the gas released from diesel was more thicker and hazardous. After a bunch of air pollution built up, they enforced a ban that would stop cars from driving for a specific amount of time to halt the gas buildup. If you were caught driving when the ban was active,you were fined 22 euros, (or in american currency, 31 dollars) and people the declined the fine, the authorities impounded their car. Paris was generous enough to allow public transit and it would be free of charge, but it wasn't too easy for the companies to budge because they would be losing money. In Bogota, Columbia, they have already been taking action in this gas problem, by banning cars for a specific amount of time, but this is their third straight year doing this. This campaign originated in the 1990s and was said to improve Bogota. They have constructed 118 miles of bicycle paths and have promoted bicycle use. A business man named Carlos Arturo said that ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" which is entirely true. Their goal is to get people to use alternate transportation and to reduce the smog that the cars created."
25102,0,"The fire tripled in size, and it had reached my ceiling before I knew it my whole kitchen was on fire. Here how it happened, I had asked my friend for advice on what should I do if the oil catches on fire. He told me to just pour water on it. The oil caught on fire, and I poured water on it, and you can guess what had happened, the fire tripled in size. Everyone agrees that we should always ask more than one person for advice, but sadly not everyone does it, and it can have daring consequences. I say that everyone should ask more than one person for advice because, it gives then more of a better understanding on the idea, you can see if someone is incorrect about the advice they gave you, and it is usually safer and better in general to ask for advice. Asking more than one person for advice can give you a better understanding on the idea you are asking about, and it you can learn more. Lets say that for an example, you were asking about how to make your computer faster, and you learned new things about how a computer and how the parts of a computer work. For another example, you wanted to change your cars oil, but forgot which tube is the oil one. I ask someone for advice and know you know where the water or the liquid cooler goes just in case your car breaks down. For instance, you wanted to know where to put commas, so you ask for advice and after a couple of tries you now know where periods go instead of putting commas there. That is why it is better to ask more than one person for advice, because you can get a better understand of the idea and learn more. Asking more than one person for advice is much better than just asking one person, because you can see if they are incorrect or not. For an example, I asked ten people if I can use eggs that have only been expired for a day. Everyone said no it is expired do not use it, except for one person who said it is okay to use, I was able to see that the one person that said it was okay most likely incorrect. For another instance, I asked my four of my friends if the mall is closed today, three of them said it is not closed, but one person said it is not closed yet. I can see that the person who said the mall is not closed yet is most likely wrong. Furthermore, I was not able to decide which car faster, so I can buy it for the race that is in two months, so I asked six of my friends for advice about which car is faster the BMW or Mercedes. five of them said the BMW but one of them said the Mercedes is faster, so that most likely means that the person who said the Mercedes is faster is incorrect. Asking some people for advice instead of one person is better, because it is safer. For an example, I went to the doctor to see if I was sick, but the doctor said I was not sick, but I had showed symptoms of being sick, so I went to see two other doctors, and they both said I was sick, and I really was sick. For another instance, we were hiking in the woods when a venomous snake bite me. I urgently asked all of my friends for advice, one of my friends quickly advised me to suck the venom out, but the rest of my friends stopped me from doing it, and instead they put a really tight bandage around my leg. Now instead of losing my life I survived, because I had asked more than one person for advice. For the last example, I was modding a car, and I was going to buy a fake part, so I asked four of my friends about it. Three of my friends said do not buy it can make your car catch on fire, but one of my friends said it was okay. I did some research online and I had found out that the fake car part can actually make your car on fire. Whoosh, the fire had tripled in size, and the whole kitchen had almost burned down. That all happened because I had asked only one person for advice instead of two or three or more. Before you do anything and you do not know exactly what to do, ask more than one person for advice it will be worth it in the long run. Asking more than one person for advice is much better because. you can get a better understanding of the idea and learn more, you can see who is incorrect, and it is much safer. That is why I state to always ask more than one person for advice."
3015,0,"Cars have been noted to be a big contributor to being a big problem to the enviroment. They are also known from stealing money from other means of transportation. Since people can just use a car people neglect the other means of transportation such as taking a bus and things of that nature. The advantages of limiting car usage is that it is betters the enviroment. It also economically better for other transportation. This is why limiting car usage benefit the world and the enviroment as a whole. One of the advantages of limiting the car usage is that it betters the enviroment as a whole. An example of this is that is in ""In German Surburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" it states that ""Cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe."" This shows how cars have been a big contributor to being a big problem to the enviroment. Also as well in the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" it states that ""...and up to 50 percent in some car-initentisive areas in the United States"". This is one of the benefits of limiting car usage. Along with this, another advantage to limiting car usage in general is that it is economically better for other transportations. An example of this is, that in the city of Colombia called Bogota are doing fining of people one day a year on Tuesday for three years already and been getting good revenue out of it from other transportation(Selsky). This shows how limiting car usage contributed in a great way. This is causing a change that could only be describe as revolutionary(Riera). This why it is advantageous to limit the car usage as much possible. In conclusion, this why limiting car usage is advantageous. Since, it can help the enviroment. As well as economically benefit alternative transportations that may included one of the following buses,taxis, and transportation. This is why it is not only imperative but necessary, no a duty to human being alike to better the enviroment and economy as a whole. Unless one wants the future generations to starve, and not have clean air to breath in future years."

We must lessen the space for parking so instead of stores along a distant highway you can actually just walk to the store. 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport. We have to try harder to make the United states more like Vauban. Then, We need to get rid of cars to help get rid of pollution. Cars also causes smog, which we can get rid of if we reduced the usage of cars. Also so many cars causes congestion and a lost revenue in delivery companies. A good idea would be to fine the people like Paris did to reduce so many cars on the street. Next, The goal would be to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. So only buses and taxis would be permitted for the time being without any cars roaming the streets. Also any violaters will be faced a $25 dollar fine. This idea would be a really good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. We could also build bicycle paths to help travel. We could also have restrictions which could dramatically cut traffic. Finally, if we got rid of cars it would have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment. New York's new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities. It is said that young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. It is proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety."

Ever since the production of the car during the industrial revolution, transportation from place to place was easier for everone to be able to go to work, school or on a vacation to a distant place. This invention has changed American life as well as the lives of many others in the world. Although, the creation of the car did have some downfalls. Passenger cars are responsible for the 12% of greenhouse gasses that are emitted into the earths atmosphere. Limitting car usage would be beneficial to the earth because it would help to lessen the damaging gasses being submerged into the atmosphere. Reducing the use of your car would make navigation on the street much easier. For example, ""in this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway. With the reduction of cars being enacted store are able to be in street for easy access. This allows for stock to be brought up because many of the stores wont be a long, stressful drive away. not only stores but work would be much closer and wont involve long hours in a car every morning. Since there will be no car usage involved, the streets will be much safer to roam. The accident rate in decrease drastically. lessening the use of cars will allow for traffic to be cut in half. This would help to decrease the death rates that are caused every year. No driving would be beneficial for many. There will be no drunk drivers making the streets an unsafe place to be. the world will be a much better place to live in once cars are limitted. Decressing the use of a car would make life less stressful. People wont have to worry about driving long hours, paying off their cars or worrying about car maintainence. This will make life easier to focus on much important tasks such as school an his of her career. Thats less payments and more money for something else. Removing this machinery would allow for the debt rate to drop as well. Less people will be bankrupt and have money in their bank accounts to save. Lessening car usage would allow for a cultural shift occur, and change the way people live their life all over the world. Car usage should be reduced because this will allow for people to be more productive and less tranportation time because stores will be much closer than ever before. The reduction of cars will result in less accidents and property damage among many cities."

The Facial Action Coding System has percieved the emotions of Mona Lisa and has tryed to accuratly grade the percentage of each emoition from the picture. The program bases off of 6 basic emotions which fall in to more complicated catagories. According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles no only expresses emotions, but also may help produce them. The program is going off of the physical emtion but not the mental emotion the person is having. This flaws the percentages overall. Being another individual you can see what the persentages are and agree with them by looking at the picture in person. The mental emotion of someone may be a lot diffrent then what they are expressing physically. In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System may be a bit flawed but has improved accuracy quite a lot. Even here is says, according to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles no only expresses emotions, but also may help produce them. The system is very accurate when scanning others."
25779,0,"Have you ever asked someone for advice? If so you might have asked multiple people. Some people say that it is good to ask more than one person for advice for different things. When you ask your friends they might tell you something different from what a family member might say. Thats why you ask different people. You might need advice for many different things like relationship advice, how to take care of a pet, or what to do when you and your best friend get in a fight and you want to fix the problem but you do not know how. For example you and your friend got in a really bad fight over the littlest thing like having the same dress. Now your friend will not talk to you because she had the dress first and then you got it. You may ask yourself what to do to fix this problem so you and your friend can be best friends. In your head you might want to get rid of the dress but you like it a lot. Now you go ask one of your other friends and they say just do not worry about it and find to go find a new friend to replace your best friend and you do not want to do that. So you decide to go ask your mother what should you do to stop the argument and she says to explain that you did not know she had the dress before you went to buy it. You decided to go with what your mother said and it works and now you have your best friend back! Have you asked your mom or dad for advice with a relationship or with someone you like? You might think it is weird to talk about someone you like with your parents and that is okay. Since you think it is weird to talk to your parents you go ask your friends. Your best friend said to write a note and leave it on your crushes desk. Next you ask a person that you've known for a long time but you rarely ever talk to them, and they say to go up to that person and tell them. As you are on the way home from school you think how going up to that person might make you feel embarrassed and you do not want to be the laughing stock of the school so when you get home you ask your parents. Your parents tell you to think of a fun and clever way of doing it so they say to write whatever you want on a sticky note and put it on the persons locker. But you think to do what your best friend said and you write a note and you find out they like you back too. Another example is when your parents said that you could never have a pet when you were a kid and now that you moved out you decide to get a puppy. You have planned this moment forever but you do not know what kind of dog you want to get. Say you were living in an apartment and the only breed of dog you cannot have is a Pit Bull but thats okay because you've always wanted a German Shepherd. So you find puppies for sale and go look at them and decide to buy one. But you did not do research and now you are lost and do not know what to do. You decide to ask your mom and she said to make sure you walk the puppy and make sure it gets enough exercise because it is a big dog. Then when you go get a check-up for the puppy you ask the vet and they say to make sure the puppy gets enough food, exercise, and water. Of course you go with what the vet said and now your puppy is the best looking dog in the whole apartment building. Getting advice from different people is helpful most of the time except when they all say the same thing but you do not agree with it. Asking multiple people gives you choices and I do not know about you but I like to have many different choices. Some people might give you bad advice and other people might give you good advice and thats why you should ask multiple people for advice. If you ever need advice your parents are most likely that best people to go to depending on the problem. Your parents are almost always right for relationship advice and friend advice. But if you get a pet ask the vet."

People use their phones for everything sometimes people can do two or more things at the same time on their phone. People also use their phones at the wrong time like driving, walk around. When driving it is very hard to focus on the road/ soon you look away something or somebody can hit you. The trend of using cell phones has increased throughout the world. Cell phones make it easy to contact during emergency even during driving although using cell phones while driving is mostly dangerous and not advisable. Several researchers have proved that using cell phones while driving makes drivers more exposed to fatal accidents. The best way to avoid using cell phones while driving is ensuring safety of driver. By listen to music, making a conversation or something just don't use yourp hones. Although there are grave negative impacts of using your phone why driving, there are some benefits of using cell phones while driving. During emergency situations cell phones can provide help and driver can make emergency calls, even reporting any dangerous scenario such as roadside accid ents."

One reason is, Venus is a sister planet to Earth but we don't know alot about it so we need to go there. Going to venus can be benitfical in may ways. One way is thet it can give scientist good research that they don't have. It can also give them a way as said in the article ""to examine more closely"". Lastly we could gain more knowledge on living conditions in Venus. Even though, Venus is not the safest palce for anyone or anything to be NASA has came up with new safetey measures to ensure the people's safetey. For one as said in the article Venus is a hot place. So NASA has came up with the idea that the people that will be going to venus would be floating on top of venus so that they will not only be safe but alive. Another way to ensure saftey is to use silicon devices since metal melts on Venus, and studies have shown that using silicon is efficient, and in the article is said to last ""for three weeks"". Furthermore, not only do they have saftey measures they also uses technolgy. From past reasearch it is known that Venus burns metal so that means that to have good resaerch you have to find somthing that is not meatal to conduct your resarch. So NASA has made another project when they look at old technolgy, and they realised that mechanical computers would help when researching Venus. Mechanical computers conduct ""calculations by using gears and levers"". Also mechanical computers does not need electronics at all. In other words going to Venus can be very resourcful and problaly become of use in the future."

But you need to have some changes i this. number one you need to give 2 warnings to the kids before you tell them that they cannot play in that sport. Number two when they cant play you need to mail home a letter to there parents. Also send a report card so that they can see what you son/daughter my what they might be missing so they can get it done. But if they don't get it done they will have lunch in the teachers room in till they get it done. This is what i think about if you change the policies and what other kids might think i don't know they might get mad. But this is your option and u led our school. Sincerely STUDENT_NAME"

This can really help a teacher with their lessons. Another way that you can tell is by looking yourself in the mirror. You have muscular units that help you identify how your felling whether your happy or sad.

Not only does the release of fossil fuels harm the world, but the stress that comes with having a vehicle is immense. When considering ownership of a vehicle, one must think about the pros and cons of owning one, and realize that the limited pros... are not worth the cons. Cars, trucks, and buses have many factors in common, but one in particular is hazardous to mother nature... fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are harming our territory, the place where life has been made possible, Earth. At the streak we are going, soon enough us humans, the domain species won't have a home due to the pollutants vehicles release killing the O-zone Layer. We have become accustomed to the abuse of transportation. Even when we are capable of walking or using a bike to a nearby location, we choose to use a vehicle instead of avoiding the damage that is caused. Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the city, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intesifying smog..."" Source #2 states. Their are many ways to distinguish transportation, but one very adequate discription is ""a death wish"". The stress that comes with the ownership of any transporting vehicle surpasses what anyone can bare! The economic standards one needs to posses is difficult. In, Vauban, Germany, one can have a car under the circumstances of paying $40,000 for a parking space, along with your home, source #1 explains. Your car needs to be fed in order to function, and it's food is quite pricey, especially when it hoards gallons of the substance! In addition, one needs to pay for insurance aswell! Dangers in streets are not abnormal what-so-ever, so the stressfulness that one has behind their back while driving is not enjoyable. The benefits that come with limiting the usage of cars is grand"
11608,0,"How many different emotions have you ever felt in your life? You cannot possibly know and remember every feeling you've ever had. Using the Facial Action Coding System is a great idea and an amazing thing that has been developed, however, there is no way it is accurate. The Facial Action Coding System is not accurate because everyone has different facial structures, this system could not possibly know the structure of everyones face, could not detect all emotions, and cannot tell an emotion by the way people look. Though the face has the same muscles and bones in it, everyone has a different facial structure. Some peoples eyes are far apart, and some are closer together. Some people have more round faces, and others have more square shaped faces. The text states ""Meanwhile, muscles called orbicularis oculi palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a fake smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."", but some people may not get crow's-feet around thier eyes, and some peoples mouths may not stretch sideways like this. There are many other differences in peoples faceial structures, aside from these examples. All people feel different emotions in their life. They can also feel multiple emotions at one time. Saying that a face coding system can detect all your emotions is absurd. People have been known to feel exitement, while feeling resentment, and all other combinations of emotions. Technology today doesn't have any way of recognizing all emotions of everyone. The passage says, ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" It is not hard to guess that humans are capable of feeling more than just six emotions alone or at the same time. This would mean that the recognizing emotons part of this system is inaccurate. Acting and looking different than how you feel is an excellent way to hide your emotions. People do this almost on a daily basis. ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" Although this may be true some of the time, even smiling to hide a frown cannot always be dected by a friend. Unless clearly obvious, hiding emotions cannot easily be found. This adds to the previous reason of why the Facial Action Coding System would be inaccurate. The Facial Action Coding System is not accurate because everyone has different facial structures, this system could not possibly know the structure of everyones face, could not detect all emotions, and cannot tell an emotion by the way people look. In conclusion, this system could be highly inaccurate and ineffective. Perhaps sometime in the future, when technology is much more developed, this system may work a little better, but it will still take many years to perfect the Facial Action Coding System."
6931,0,"Has your school ever made you join extracurricular activities? If not that's totally okay! My school wants students to really get their hands on learning and exploring new things. Personally I think that's a great idea, because students are not only helping their selves stay busy but helping out their school. Because sometimes our school needs a little pick me up I think in some spots it could use a little makeover and that's okay. Some extracurricular activities you could do are, joining a sport, helping out with yearbooks and redecorate things, or you could even paint or rebuild some things too! Joining a sport can take time away from doing homework or other things, but thats what being a student athlete is about! At some points it can be really rough and stressful but really it's preparing you for the stressful things in the future. You may not think joining a sport could help you or your school but in certain situations it really can. Some schools have put tons of money into sports like buying new equipment etc. So why not continue on of what people in the past have put money into. Joining sports can be a big deal but no matter what just think about how much you are helping out. Another thing you could do is help out with yearbooks. Sometimes it can be really stressful for teachers, so why not lend another helping hand and see where it takes you. I mean you never know, they may really like the way you helped out and may ask you to do other things! You never know what the future holds. Not only can you help out with yearbooks, you could also help out by redecorating some things in your school. Just throw your opinion right in there! It could also turn into something you really enjoy and you could continue on with that. Then all you have left to do is say thank you to your principal. If you enjoy painting or building and you want to help out, let someone know and your school can definitely help find something you can do to help. One thing you could build is a new desk for a teacher or if you have a civics teacher build them a stand so they can sit like a judge in court. You never know where this ability you have could take you so take it and roll with it. Also if teachers don't like their room color you could gather some other students and help repaint their classroom. See there is always an extracurricular activity for everyone! Don't give up on looking. In so many ways you can help your school! That's why i totally agree with this decision that my principal has made. Because everyone gets a chance to show what they can do and how they can help. Sometimes you just have to throw your opinion in the mix and see what it turns out to be. This is why i love doing extracurricular activities! Show what you can do and do it. I believe in you!"
22594,0,"Many kids will believe that having to attend classes at home is a good idea because they can work at their own pace and won't have to wake up so early just to get to class on time. But the students need to realize that if schools decided to have video conferencing or online classes, then the schools would need to provide computers to every student in the county, there will be no teachers by their side to make sure they have the reassurance they need, and it will be difficult to stay focus on your school work. In order for students to be able to do their school work from home, they will need to have access to a computer. Not many students have access to Wifi or any type of technology except when they are at school. The schools will need to get a laptop to every student in the county and that will cost them millions of dollars. Because if the students attended school, the classrooms would be able to share the computers with the kids that are in each class and that way schools would'nt have to provide one for each individual student. Also, giving children under the age of twelve a computer to learn will be a big risk because there will not be someone to look after them and making sure they are doing what needs to be done in order to finish their assignments. And aslo the amount of damages will increase because children are not respondsible with valuable things especially expensive things. This issue is just a part of something bigger that will happen if we were to switch to distant learning. Another conflict that could happen would be students needing more guidence. When students are in class and need clarification, the teacher will be there answering each and every students questions if they are confused. In distant learning they wont have access to that anymore because there will be no teacher. Since everything is online, students will have to email the teacher and might have to wait an entire day to get a response back. Also, students might need to learn a specific topic a different way and not every teacher is the same. At school the students are able to get help from different teachers and have a different perspective on a subject that they might have never knew about if there were'nt different teachers with different methods at their disposal. Last issue would be that students will end up getting distracted very easilly. Parents are usually at work most of the day and will not be there to make sure their kids are staying up to date with their assignments because they have a family they need to provide to. Most students have a phone, t. v, or tablet available to them at any time and it will make it dificult for them to stay focus and on track. This will make it harder for students to turn in their assignments on time because it will be hard to resist the temptation of using a device that isnt the computer with their assignment on it. Students need to have a teacher there to help them stay focus on what is nessessary and always have someone to look out for them with their school work. Students are still children and they need an adult who has been through the struggle to help them get on the right path to success. The students may act like they can be independent but they still need assistance from an adult. Distant learning defeats the whole purpose of being able to interact with one another and having the ablility to have decent communication skills. Children need to get out of their comfort zone and expericence the life outside their own room. There are so many opportunuties that each student could get if they stay in school and put themselves out there and have connections with other people. Therefore, having students attend classes from home would be not be a good decision."

18050,0,i think that having self driving cars would help alot. there are so many wreacks in the states because some people just dont know how to drive right. so if we was to invent and sell computerized cars it could stop us from having so many wreaks plus it would also cause us to drive way safer. for instance if your drunk and you have to get home you just sit in the car and it will drive for you since you cant do it yourself because your not in the right stae of mind. there is also the thought of making better roads but when you think about it that would cost more then a fortune to do. one other reason im all for this invention is because you know that the people making these cars are gonna earn a tone of money so that means more people will be switching to the new car instead of their old one. before you know it there will be somthing new and even better in technology since we just keep getting smarter over the years. who knows we might be driving hover craft later on in a few years because alot can be learned. although we would also have to make some new laws or change a few of them. like in the text it states that what if somone gets in a wreak in a smart car should the driver be blamed or the companies that sold the the car to that person beheld responcibale. there also still some improvements that have to be made before they can even start selling those cars. those are the main reasons that i think making smarter cars is a great idea.

19839,0,"Presidential election is held every after four years on the first Monday of the month November. We decide who's going to be our next leader, the President. Electoral College is kind of unfair for some people because they think that whoever got the most popular vote should be President. But to think, what if the people we vote to is not right to be the next President and she/he got that most popular vote? Wouldn't that be a disaster? I say we should keep the Electoral College. Electoral College process in consists of the electors that have been selected by the people. The ones who got selected are the ones with great intelligence and with great sense of leadership. In the first passage it mentioned that ""The Electoral College has a total of 538 electoras and the majority of electoral votes are required to have 270 electoral votes."" This means that for you to be one of the candidates you atleast have to have 270 electoral votes and this is a good way of picking our candidates to run for us for President. Remember the election between Obama and Romney? It was close but, not that close. Our President, Obama got 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to 51.3 percent of the popular votes for him and Romeny. Almost of every states electoral votes is on a ""winner-take-all"" basis. For every slight of pulrality in each of the states, it creates a ""landslide electoral-vote"". This means that a tie would be possible because the number 538 votes is uneven but, it's mostly not to happen and this is because of Electoral College. Electoral College avoids the problem of which didn't receive a majority of the votes. In passage three it gave an example about how Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had 43 percent only in pluraity of the popular votes and the winning number of the Electoral College is 301 and 370 electoral votes. Because of Electoral College the pressure that happens in electing the next President to lead us for four years is reduced and it also tells us which is the winner of the election. If we elect our President using popular votes it migh be a disaster. Because not all of the candidates are that great of leading the whole country and If he/she got selected to be our next leader for the next four years our country would be in a huge chaos. I slightly agree with electing that person and making him/her the next President because they got the most popular votes but, then again I don't think it's the right way of picking our new leader."
8254,0,"Exploring Venus seems very interesting when thinking about it. All of the beneficial things that we can study and analyze. Studying other planets have always been helpful to mankind and helps people gain insight on our solar system around us. But at the same time exploring these planets are very dangerous too. Not because of animals or humans but because of the harsh living conditions on other planets. So I will tell you why I think exploring Venus is not worth the pursuit of exploring. My first reason of why I think Venus is not worth the pursuit is because of the difficulty of exploring Venus. In paragrpah 6 it states that ships orbiting over Venus with lights can't see the ground because of the dense atmosphere. Which makes it hard for scientists because if you can't see anything you can't analyze any data that you get because of Venus's features. But it does state that NASA is trying to find new ways of exploring Venus but it's not as good as hands on exploration. Which is good but most likely not good enough to find out what they want about the planet. My second reason of why I think Venus is not worth the exploration is because of Venus's conditions and features. When reading about Venus the conditions are very extreme compared to the conditions on Earth. Such as clouds filled with highly corrosive sulfuric acid or temperatures that average over 800 degrees. Making it the planet with the hottest surface temperature even though Mercury is closer to the sun. Also the atmospheric pressure is great enough to crush an accustomed submarine that would be able to dive into the deepest parts of the ocean and liquifies metals. But having similarities to Earth such as erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes and etc. So in conclusion I feel that Venus should not be a planet we heavily invest in and scientists should try other planets before Venus. Because of the harsh conditions that it would have on humans. Because of the difficulty in analyzation. Making Venus a non-reliable source compared to others. So that is why I think that Venus is not worth exploring."

They will also study less for tests or doing their homework,and hang out more with their friends and play games. Four years ago when I was home- schooled I could not focus for most of the time, because there were many distractions and I got distracted easily. Since my mother was my teacher I thought that things would be easier to accomplish, but it was actually harder. Because I did not take it seriously at first and I was not paying attention. Some students can stay focused and are able to attend their classes at home, because the comfort of their home might be a positive thing and might have a positive outcome. For me it sometimes was because things were a lot easier to accomplish at home then at school. Others may not take advantage of this opportunity and will not focus on their classes. Students won't benefit from taking class at home because they will get distracted, they won't accomplish anything at home, and some students have to be monitored by their parents in order to complete their work. Students will get distracted if they are taking their classes at home. When I was home schooled I used to get distracted by my family,my friends, and my phone. I could not focus and stay on task as if I was in a real classroom. They will not be studying or doing their homework,they will play games or be on their phones. My friends would call me a lot of times when I was studying, and I would reply even though I should have not. Some students might be responsible enough to get their work. Their were sometimes where I could focus and get all of my work done but it was rare. They will also not get distracted by anything and stay on task. Others might hang out with their friends and not worry about school. The only way that students can have their classes at home is if they are truly capable of staying on task without getting distracted. Students won't accomplish anything if they are taking their classes at home. They will get to comfortable at their homes, and they will not focus. They will be lazy and some students may not even attend their classes. Sometimes I would not attend some of my classes because I would either be sick or I just was tired that day. It is very common for students who get comfortable at home to skip or not attend their classes, because they are either annoyed by school or tired as well. Some students take advantage of this opportunity and use it as motivation into completing their work. While others are lazy and do not stay on task. Students have to be monitored by their parents to take their classes at home. Most students are sometimes are watched by their parents to make sure that they complete their assignments without any distractions. Some parents confiscate their children's phones so that when they are studying or doing their homework they stay focused. There were times where my mother would take away my phone so that I could complete my work without any interruptions. Some students are not monitored my their parents because their parents are either at work, or they trust that their kid can stay focused. During my time in home school my mother would sometimes let me do my assignment without any monitoring and I got some assignments done. Parents sometimes try to get their kids out of the house so that they can study at the library so that they are not lazy and do not distracted. Students should not be allowed to take their classes at home because they will not stay on task. They won't accomplish anything at home. They also have to be monitored by their parents sometimes to ensure that they complete their work. There are a few students who do not need their parents and can complete their tasks without get distracted. Students won't focus in their classes, they will be busy hanging out with their friends and playing games. The four years that I was home-schooled I got distracted many times, and it took me a while to just focus in my classes. If students are allowed to take classes at home they will never accomplish anything,and it will make it harder for them to concentrate on school."
25166,0,"""Why does everyone think I shouldn't go to the movie with Generic_Name?"" confusingly asks Generic_Name. The whole group just sighs and gives Generic_Name a quick glance with a voice backing it all up saying, ""She just isn't right for you that's why."" Generic_Name looks to the ground with defeat on the outside but rage filled on the inside which causes him to try giving a quick defending response. All that came out of his mouth was,""Well what if you're wrong,"" Which caused the whole group to walk away with quiet whispers and a few laughs. Seeking advice from more than one person is a better choice because it gives you different points of view, more options to choose from, and keeps you closer to the people around you. First off, seeking opinions from others can be a better choice than only getting an opinion from one person because, it gives you multiple points of view. A great example of this is when my friend Generic_Name got in a fight once. He got sent to the office and was claiming he didn't start it and it was self defense, so they called in a few people who saw what had happened and found out Generic_Name was telling the truth. This is important because if you only ask one person they can use their bias opinion to make a person or situation seem better or worse than it actually was. Another example is in football when there is a call being made all the refs huddle up to talk about their opinions on what happened during the play. This highlights the fact that when there are multiple opinions the out come is usually better and more logical. Secondly, another good thing about seeking others opinions it can give you more options to choose from. For instance, this happens a lot in the sports world on final plays of the game. What happens is there is not much time left on the clock so they all try to figure out the best play possible to win and try to execute it. This is only useful when there is multiple opinions and plays coming in because with out different options than the one option used might not have been the best one or the most successful. To illustrate, another time having multiple opinions is helpful is when you have a girlfriend. I had the similar thing happen to me when I was dating someone because I didn't have any ideas for a date, so when I asked my friends I had much better and more ideas. All the ideas were helpful and useful and made my date worth while. Lastly, seeking advice from multiple people is better because it keeps you closer to the people around you. An example of this is when I asked my friends for their opinion on the sport of basketball it not only made me contact them and talk to them but now they know that I am working on a report for school. This helps all of us out because know they know i'm working on my report which means I can't hang out right now and I reminded them about it and made them do it. In addition, this happens a lot when my mom asks one of our neighbors for their opinion on a certain product, but it ends up turning into them catching up and talking for the first time in a while. This helps my mom and our neighbors to stay in touch and get better opinions on products or services. ""Hey guys, what do you think I should do for me and Generic_Name's anniversary?"" asks Generic_Name. They all think for a quick second then spit out ideas at Generic_Name like a waterfall. ""Necklace, gift, chocolate, and flowers."" quickly states the group. While Generic_Name is still processing the information, he says, ""I think i'll just go with the necklace and flowers, but thanks for the ideas."" All in all, seeking out multiple opinions for advice is better than only having one opinion."
21918,0,"I would go with policy 1, because there are many reasons why students would have their cell phones with them. There could have been something bad in your family and one of your parents might call to notify you what has happened, there's some kind of murderer in the school and the phones are out and cell phones are the only device to contact someone when you really need help, or you are on school grounds in a severe condition and there is no one else there to help you, you could either call for help or use your cell phone. I kind of support the use of cell phones even though I don't own one, I might ask for someone to use their's when I need to make a call. Even though these events are rare, you might not know what will happen. In my opinion, I would tell the principle to use policy 1. If I asked all the students who have cell phones with them if they want policy 1, there would be a chance that most of them would say yes. If I asked teachers with cell phones, probably most of them would want policy 2. I have already wrote a letter to the principle before this for an assignment if students should be allowed to have cell phones, either for educational use, emergency, or at certain time periods. Students want their cell phones with them just to be equal to their teacher, even though we are already equal by having an education and what events the school hosts for us to join."
24342,0,"What is learning? How do we learn? Where does learning take place? In a public school? In a private school? What about through the lens of a technological device? With technology skyrocketing in this new decade of 2020, we find ourselves using more and more online means of communication then we ever have! This technological communication is great and all, but should it be used for school? First off, homeschooling has been around for my whole life; however, just in this last decade the word ""home school"" has been given a whole new meaning. The communication of students to professors through online video conferencing is not only getting more popular, but has also brought amazing benefits to both sides. This way of communicating is not only much more efficient for the student and professor as far as personal time goes, but much more efficient for our environmental factors as well! The amount of gas just students alone use getting to and from school is astounding. We already have enough people letting the toxic fumes of carbon dioxide from gas burn off ruin our atmosphere; why have more than we need? If just one in ten students were able to video chat, or take class online one to three times a week with their professors, the time, energy, money, and well being of people would dramatically increase. Besides it's a lot easier to power an iPhone or iPad, than to power a car. Secondly, video communication doesn't just benefit the professor and video callers of the class, but it also benefits the other students in that class! More students at home means more of an empty class, a more empty class means less distraction, and less distraction means more working, teaching, and listening gets accomplished by the class. Less students in classes also means that the students there get more hands on time with their professors! Professors are also much less stressed with a tiny class compared to an enormous one. There definitely aren't any negative effects to having: smaller classes, more student engagement, and less distractions. Finally, their's an extremely high number of working adults, who are either still in college or going back to college, who simply don't have time to go to class because they have to make a living on their own. School online is crucial for these kinds of people. The privilege to be able to video conference with a professor, and have it count just as if you were there sitting in class is unremarkable. For this reason, I don't see how anyone could respectably hate the idea of school online, and with that being said, I feel we should continue to embrace online classes as much as we can. Overall, technology has blown up the educational world, not just for college students, but everyone. Regardless of where you live, how you get to school, or even how you do in school. Technology has had a crucial impact on our learning lives, and will continue to do so for many years to come."
23497,0,"According to the Washington Post, there has been an increase in student population in schools around the U.S. they are being crowed with more and more students every year. Because of this more students in the future will need to take online classes at home instead of going to the school and doing so. Being able to do class work at home, will benefit the students that live far from the school; they attend and make it easier for them to get the education they still need. Distance learning will also help the students manage there time better. Because of the fact the students don't have to go and spend time at the actual school. The travel time it takes the students to go and come back from school would not be a factor anymore if they attend online classes in there house. A reason distance learning could benefit students is that it could improve student attendance. If you were sick and could not go to school you can work on the things you will miss at school. Another thing is that for the students that struggle with transportation to get to school on certain days; instead they can finish the school work at home which would be easier instead of stressing over how they are going to get to school. The way it would benefit students is that it will help them focus more on work than instead of focusing on transportation to school. This could also benefit on the days that school gets canceled. For example school gets canceled because of a snow day or some other reason. Something that is really big on news right now is the outbreak of the Coronavirus. The U.S. is deciding to close schools in certain states around the country. Distance learning could benefit by if some schools were to actually close, it would not affect student education as much as it would if there was not a way to learn at home. If there was a snow day and some parents did not want there kids to walk to school on the sidewalk because it was dangerous; and they could drive them either because of the fact they had to go to work. A easier and safer way would be just to have them do the school tasks in there house. In the past when it rained or snowed really hard and the next day I had to go to school sometimes the roads would be flooded or their would have been an acident that prevent me from getting to school. In those cases it would be nice to have the option to learn from home instead of going through the trouble to figure out a way on how to get to school. In some cases it is better for the students to work at school than it is at home. A reason being is at school they can meet new friends and be in a better working and studying envoirment. Another thing would be that their are less things that could distract you from completing work. For example when you are at home you have all your computers, phone, TV, and things like a Xbox that could get you distracted or off topic. When you are at school their are friends that can distract you to but when you are in class it is hard to do anything else besides work. The reason is that your teacher won't let you go on your phone or talk to your friends as much before you finish with your in class assignment. A Benefit from going to school is that a lot of the things that you learn come from talking or hearing it from people at school. So if you attend classes at home instead of going to school it impacts some things that you could actually learn from going to school. A lot of the things I have learned in my past is from talking or asking a friend how to complete an assignment, if you are at home and have nobody to talk to it is not as beneficial as it is going to school. The fact being that their are benefits from learning at home and learning at school. Because when you are at home you can get distracted easier cause their is no teacher that is watching over you to complete your assignments. But when you are at school you are surrounded by other kids that could talk to you and disturb you on doing your work. Their are pros and cons in both situations but having the option to attend classes at home is better than not having the ability to. Because of that I think that distance learning is better in most cases cause it gives you more options in how you can complete work."

25530,0,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. Some people ask more than one person for there advice, so they can weight there options. The advice I go to my friends for are Clothes, Nail Polish, and Hair. Those are just a couple but those are the major ones. The first reason I go to my friends for advice is Clothes. Some clothes are cute but some are to cropped for me. I ask my friends if this would look good on me. Some of the stuff does but, some doesn't. Also if my clothes match. I send them the outfit that I am wearing and get there opinions. most of the time my clothes match. It is just when I am unsure about it matching that I send it to them. Another reason I go to my friends for advice is Nail Polish. Nail Polish is hard to pick from because they have so many beautiful colors. When I am choosing I send the colors that I like the most and the glitter, if I am feeling a glitter that day,. After I send them, they text me the ones they like and then I choose between those that they choose, or the ones that got choose the most. once i have them then i try then out on a piece of my finger so then i will know if they are darken then the bottle says or litter. On another piece of that same finger nail i make sure the Nail Polishes look good together. The final reason I go to my friends for advice is Hair. I ask this question a lot, if my hair looks good?. The reason I do that is because I try new hair styles, and I wear them to school so i ask people if I look good with it. For example, I learned how to french braid and i wore it to school. All day people were asking me to do there hair. so i guess it looked good. My conclusion is that when people ask for advice you should answer it and help them out. I help people out when they come to me. When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. If you are that person then you are a important person to them. These are just a couple of the things I go my friends for but when I do they are happy because they got to help out one of there friends with advice. The advice I go to my friends for are clothes, nail polish, and hair. Those are only a couple but the major ones."
19690,0,"Dear State Senator, Many people today have very strong oppinions on why or why not we should keep the Electoral College. I am writing to you today to tell you some of the reasons why the Electoral College should not be used anymore. The Electoral College, like most things, has room for error. However this is the type of error that you want to try as hard as possible to avoid. Any error here could lead to the false election of a President and Vice President. Now maybe the falsely elected President and Vice President have some wonderful ideas on how to help our country as a whole, but in carrying out their wonderful sounding plans, may have to hurt or cut back other resources to do so which could hurt us. This is just one example of how the Electoral College can go wrong. The Electoral College has been used for many years and has become an anachronism. We consider ourselves a democracy yet we use a non-democratic method of selecting a president. With the Electoral College comes the certanty of outcome. The winning candidate's share of his/her Electoral College usually exceeds the share of the popular vote. The Electoral College requires the president to be a candidate with a trans-regional appeal. Any candidate with regional appeal is very unlikely to be succeful as president. The residents of the other regions will most likely feel disenfranchised and that this candidate is not really their president. The swing states tend to pay closer attention to the campaigns and to really listen to what the competeing candidates have to say. The residents in the swing states tend to be the most thoughtful voters. In the Electoral College, they try to restore a political balance between the large and the small states. With the Electoral College you avoid the problem of an election where no candidate recieves a majority vote which would complicate the presedential election process. All of these reasons are great and everything but there is always going to be a flaw in the system. Some believe that is is the people who vote in the presidents, however, all we are doing is electing the slate of electors who are are the real people who elect the president. In the Electoral College there is a disaster factor. The electors chosen could always defy the will of the people. These electors can be anyone who does not hold public office. Voters cannot always control who their electors vote for and some voters get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. The most worrying part though is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. If a tie were to happen, the election would be thrown off to the House of Representatives, where the state delegations would vote on the president. Due to the fact that each state casts only one vote, one single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have just as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who are representing 35 million voters. The House's selection can hardly be expected to refelct the will of the peple in the states. The elections can be only a few swing voters away from a catastrophe. The Electoral College is unfair to the voters in its most basic level. Due to the winner-take-all system that is in place in each state, the candidates don't spend as much time if any at all in the states they know they have no chance of winning, and spend most of if not all of their time on the tight races in the 'swing' states. Like everything it would take some timw to get used to the changes and I understand that. I also understand that election by popular vote has its flaws as well. It is time to change from an outdates, irrational, and unfair method. Thank you for your time and consideration about this. I hope you consider changing from the Electoral College to election by popular vote. _____________________"
19891,0,"Dear Florida state senator, I believe that we should keep this Electoral college process because it will be very helpful. With the Electoral college process it is not just popular vote that wins. If it was just popular vote that won then we would not even have smart people running for president and have celebrities winning and becoming president. With the Electoral college process there is also the presidency vote. The presidency vote basically tells us wether they are smart or not. ""Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election then the kind we have now."" In this piece of evidence it shows how the presidency vote inside the Electoral college process can win an election even if you win the popular vote. Which shows how much more important the Presidency vote is and why we need the Electoral college process. If we lost it we would be lost. Just imagine people like Kim Kardashian being a president. Sincerely, Someone who cares"
8088,0,"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" doesn't support the idea of studying Venus well as it lacks with detail, and they don't go in depth with the pros of exploring this inhabitated plant and how it would benifit us in doing so. In the article we are introduced to Venus and given a glimpse of our background history with them. The author also includes infromation of the planet's atmosphere and how it's a challenging factor for us when attempting to reach its suface, the huge difference that seperates us from them. When given information of past travels, we are informed that ""Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades,"" (TCEV). With this alone there is already doubt engendered in the reader's mind because of how long it has been since we last attempted to reach such grounds and how even then spacecrafts weren't durable when they did make it. ""Each previous mission was unmanned"" due to the circumstances they were met with yet when further reading is made we are told that NASA wants to send humans to Venus. This only adds to the concerns of the reader in manifesting alien-like areas. Then we are explained of possible ways NASA is already planning to approach Venus and how they are already working, or at least contemplaiting, ways to last longer in Earth's 'Twin Sister'. We are given a jot down of how things are being tested and what it is they are trying to overcome in order to create something durable that will hold longer than a few hours. The only reason we are given for this is that ""Astronomers are facinated by Venus because it may well once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system,"" (TCEV). The author doesn't even clarify how this is impactful to our society today. What is there to gain from a planet that ""may well once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system?"" In that sentence alone there is still some uneasiness since it's not sure or confirmed that Venus was once like Earth. Therefore, this is why the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" doesn't support the idea of studying Venus very clearly. The lack of pros and benifits to our planet adding to the pot of cons and uncertainty that was instead made from reading this article. Surely they did a splendid job in guiding us through possible ways that'll help in exploring the harsh environments and listing final encounters we have had before, but no information was straightforward when it came as to why we should invest time in going to Venus when such dangerous challenges are in front of us."
4124,0,"I personally think that students should be assigned summer projects so they don't get lazy and they are able to get back in the school environment prepared. If students do get assigned a summer project I think it should be teacher-designed so students can get more out of it. During this essay I will briefly explain all my ideas and why I think students should be assigned some summer projects. Hopefully after reading this I hope you take my personal opinion into account. First, students need to be assigned work so they arent turned into lazy slobs after summer ends. That doesn't mean they can't rest, but that also means they can't do nothing for their entire summer break. If students are assigned summer project it can remind them how hard working they were in the past and it will make them continue to work hard! For example, when I was younger I never had anything assigned to me so when I got back into school I didn't have the right mindset and I was never able to work hard; Now however, I am being assigned summer projects and although it's a pain for me to do them I still appreciate that summer projects keep me focused. Next, Students should be assigned a summer project so they can get back into the learning world easily. If students go into summer with no assigned projects then they'll forget a lot of things they've learned in the past. my sister, who's finished with school, told me that school was way easier because she was always assigned work during the summer and it helped her remember what shes learned. currently at this time and age I feel as if students don't take things like this into account and always question why they can't remember past material, but it's because they don't have and summer projects that would help them in their next years classes. if we're being assigned a summer project then I would want it to be teacher-designed because your teachers will know what's best for you so they can assign things based on your weaknesses and things that can help you in your future. Say you were student that was struggling in science in the past. Teachers can use that knowledge and can assign you a project that can teach you what you weren't able to learn before. If teachers give you project based on what your weaknesses are then it is a major game changer for your future. I understand that some students disagree in the fact that some schools should have summer projects because they might be busy during the summer because they might have work and a lot of things going on at home, but students still need to be assigned summer projects so they won't always be lost once they come back to school. If the student does the project and comes back to school prepared then they will end up thanking the teachers for assigning them the project. I was assigned a math project during the summer for geometry and it really ended up helping me because I usually struggle in that subject but not anymore! In conclusion, I personally think that students should be assigned summer projects so they don't get lazy and they are able to get back in the school environment prepared. if you still disagree on students needing to do summer projects then write a response on why you disagree. Once you finish your response on why you disagree then I would recommend you present it to your teachers and see what they think!"

Why sit at home when you can be emjoying yourself with various adventures. Another reason may be just getting out of the house and exploring.

12662,0,"The Face on Mars is one of the most contriversial landforms around. Many people think that it is an artifact that was left behind by past civilizations on Mars. On the other hand, there are people that beleive it is just a mesa, ""landorrms common around the American West."" There are many people in both parties, making for a huge ""debate."" The most logical, however, is that the Face is naturally occuring, due to the evidance that NASA has been able to uncover. The people that say it is an ancient civilization use illogical evidance for their conclusions, such as, ""alien markings were hidden by haze."" However, the people that believe it is naturally occuring use stable evidance, including, ""Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.' Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" This evidance shows that the best technology we have shows nothing more than, ""a lava dome that takes the form of and isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" Another way to show that the Face on Mars is naturally occuring is the comparison to the lanforms here on Earth, such as the mesa landforms in the American West. In the passage, Jim Garvin, a cheif scientist at NASA, working specifically on Mars exploration, is quoted saying,""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" Garvin, as said before, is a chief scientists at NASA. If he concludes that it is just like a lanform people can see here, than why would anyone be able to argue that? People strive to find out what is in the unknown. Researchers are some of the people that put their lives into getting the best evidance that they can find about the unknown. The Face on Mars is one example of many projects scientists have put time and effort into. They will always find the best solution or answer to whatever the question may be. Why not trust their conclusions?"
340,0,"Phones and Driving First, cell phones and humans are like a duo and used by them almost every day. Humans and cars are also another duo or like a duo. But, people phones and cars and or driving? That personally is not a good idea. That is what I will be explaining in this essay. Is it or it is not a good idea to be texting and driving at the same time? Many different opinions from different people but, here is mine. Next, have you ever been on a road with more than one lane and the person next to you is looking down on their device? Ask yourself do you think that is safe? Operating a cell phone is okay, and is done on a daily basis. People often think that since they have been texting and driving for long periods of time that they are experts and can do it with no problem. When in reality anything can happen at any moment you look down at your device, and it is certainly not safe. Then, one of the number one causes of death in the world is car accidents. Usually it comes from texting and driving or even a drunk driver. Texting and driving is not safe and people should NOT be able to operate a vehicle and use cell phones. Why? Because, people die every day from a car accident either because of a device or drinking and driving. I believe that it will decrease the number of crashes and save many lives. Therefore, Driving and texting should not be allowed. Very dangerous and you have a high risk of losing your life and others in your car and around your car. If you are in a vehicle your phone should not even be your main focus, because the road should have all of your attention. It is better to be safe than sorry on the road, and help prevent many accidents. In conclusion, I think phones and driving should NOT happen together. I mean as in texting and driving at the same time. It has been a law but is barely followed by anyone. Many people will still text and drive but, for people who care about other they will follow this law. Maybe even one day they will prevent someone else from losing their life."

In the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" By Elisabeth Rosenthal; She goes to explain that in Vauban, Germany there is a community that have given up on cars. Without a car on the streets you can tell its more lively with the quote ""Heidrun walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked berdants streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor."" With that quote from the article you can tell that the streets are filled with the sound of people rather than the sound of motors and smoke from the vehicles. Certaninly not having cars is a great advantage to suburbs, in Rosenthal article it said "" there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking... in attempt to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation... in this new approach, stores are placed a walk away..."" Instead of wasting gas and filling the air with disgusting gas, stores could be just around the corner. Which in return would be easier for everyone around. Even the united states, enviromental protection agency is promoting""car reduced"" communites. Another advantage to limiting car usage is to reduce smog and air pollution, in the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robery duffer he informs us that paris actually enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the golbal city. It stated "" Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog... [the smog] rivaled Bejing,china, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" By banning driving they not only were able to reduce the smog and air pollution, They obviously reduced car traffic! Also In the article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in bogota"" by Andrew Selsky, they banned car in an effort to promote alternative transportation and reduce spog. In the article is said ""parks and sports center also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-house restrictins have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants andupscale shopping districts have cropped up."" The day also is said to help lower stress, "" It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air population,""said buisnessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife. As you can tell from the facts within this essay, there are definitly many advantages with limiting car usage, from reducing smog and pollution, to having stores built closer to home. These advantages not only help the citzens but also the planet we live on, and our future children and their children and so on..."

Driverless cars are a good concpt to me mainly because it ais a more efficiant way of getting around here are a few examples. First example, Driverless cars are cleaner than most public transportation, people who usually take the bus or subway know that public transportation is alot dirtier than say driving. Now that drverless cars are here that can all change. Second example, Many people who are usually tired while driving ccan rely on the car itself to do the driving while they are snoozing, now I know that they still need some human skills to get them going sometimes, but now that technology is advancing that can all be improved in a matter of years. Third and final example, It is more efficiant on the planet than most other cars, in the article it stated that the driverless cars will use half of fuel that regular cars take up. There are electric cars but those discharge very quickly and gasoline cars will damage the planet, now i'm not saying that driverless cars will not run on fuel but they will use half of what other cars do reducing the amount of polluton that is getting spread into the air."

7045,0,"Regarding the decision the Principal made, (""all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity"") I agree with for the following reasons. The first reason I agree with the Principal is, his decision will improve social life for many students at our school. Social Life is very important for kids my age because, it helps build character, (which means, it builds up personality and special traits within a certain student) creates new friendships, (always a good thing to have) and it will also make the student feel like they're a part of something. Another reason I agree with the Principal is, his decision will also help students who are dealing with personal stress. As everyone knows, a lot of kids my age suffer from different types of stress. Which are mostly caused by either depression, anxiety or even loneliness. Which means that with this new opportunity they have, their depression, anxiety, and loneliness might go down a bit as they get to interact with other students while they participate in activities they might of never even tried before. The final reason I agree with the Principal is, his decision will even help students develop time management skills. Most students at our school (that I know of) either don't have time or don't know how to fit everyday activities like school, homework, and free time in their everyday lives. So, since they have to participate in something new now, it might open up their eyes a bit and help them see how to distribute their time, which will result in them having some free time at the end of the day. In conclusion, I think the Principal's decision to make students attend or take an extracurricular activity is a great idea because, it improves social life, lowers stress some students might have, and also helps students develop time management skills."
16568,0,"Dear Principle I agree with the decision to change the C average to a B average to be eligible for any extra curricular activities, because it may increase the over all effort of a schools performance. It may even be a step to encourage more effort in the classroom, and of the person themselves to be a better person. Changing the school policy might result in viewer students trying out for sports or other extra curricular activities. There might be an increase in a students effort in school to do better, due to the fact if they do not have the required grades, they may not join any activities. I believe that grades might even improve in the overall class average. It may also help to encourage more students to do extra curricular activities that can motivate students to do their best in school. It may even be good to encourage this now by keeping their good grades, so that later in life they may Changing the school policy might serve as a motivator to other students, to do better in school. To get the best effort out of any student, you require a very good motivator. Sports or other activities that might help their future, will get more students to do their best efforts. It will especially help those students if the motivator is something that is fun and if it is something they love to do. It will be very good to change the policy because it will bring out the best of ever student to do better in school. Students will do better if they have something that motivates them to do their best, to be able to do something they enjoy doing. It will not only be to the schools advantage but the students advantage as well."
4390,0,"Summer porjects should be designed by the students because the students would make it better to understand, teachers would give us boring projects and we need the mental break in the summer, and students get summer jobs so they need to focus on that. Not all students understand a project the same, some need extra help understanding the project, everyone has a different mindset. Students would make the project at their own pace, others would make the project fun and not a long and boring one, since its summer it should all be about doing fun things, they would actually understand it since its their own, and they wouldn't hate it as much. After a long school year students need a break from all of the studying and work they been doing in school, some students have stress from all of the projects that the teachers leave them and they would appreciate to do a project of their own and not a boring project, some others may suffer from anxiety which means a painful or fearful uneasiness of mind usually over an impending or anticipated event,other students might actually enjoy doing a project for once since its their own. Students usually get summer jobs, since they want to make money of their own since they can't becasue they are busy with school. While doing their project they would bring stuff from their work depending where they work at, and since its theirs they wouldn't have to work hard and maily focuse in makijng the money they need, they may be working to save up money for college since its extremely expensive or help their parents pay the bills its good to start paying bills at a young age. This is why students should make their summer projects and not the teachers because the students would make it better to understand, teachers would give us boring projects and we need the mental break in the summer, and students get summer jobs so they need to focus on that and to be honest majority of the students aren't going to do the project regardless if they make it or if the teachers make it since its summer."
22932,0,"DISTANCE LEARNING I think students can be benefit because they can have more time, if they have job or they need an extra class but, they could not be or stay after school or they just cannot come to school for personals reasons I think those students can be benefit. First,student from high school much of them have a job and they need take class at home just for three hours and then rest to get ready to their job. They also can have time to do homework it's how it can be easy for them to study more and have a grade and graduate. Second, if they are almost to finish high school, but they just need a credit and they don't want to be in school just for one class they should take that class online and have more time; it can be for homework or they go to visit another place but they cannot missing that class because they need that credit and grade for graduation. What about they can not stay after school but they need that grade they can take that online while they're at home. Third, if the person have deformity they could not walk, or just don't want to come to school for different reason most be bullying, they can be benefit with the online class so they can get they class done and fine what they want to be in their future, also can have their graduation. I really think those are the reason why they can be benefit with the online classes they have more time for homework, job, rest, and visit others place, and also they get the grade that they need that is how they're benefit."
1142,0,"Texting and driving Even though majority of humans own and operate a phone on a daily basis,but honestly i don't think anyone should operate a cell phone under a wheel because it causes the driver to become distracted and lose control of the wheel causing an innocent driver to lose their life or even both of them to lose their life,it also may cause the driver to get so distracted that they run the light and hit somebody. It has been said that not only the texting have caused the descraction in drivers but the social network,gps systems,music apps and other things also draw the attention of drivers away from the road,cell phone use behind the wheel also reduces the amount of brain activity used to drive by 37 percent,there have been tools created to hold the phone on the dashboard to avoid drivers to hold the phone while they drive,but not even the tools created could not stop the accidents. There have been many stories of teens losing their life due to texting and driving causing grief from family but if teens choose to put the phone down while driving or text before they start the car there would have been less accidents in the united states,honestly i think drivers get distracted either way if they use the equipment for the phones or not because if they was to get a text or phone call they still gonna look off the road and possibly cause an accident,ways people could possibly stop this would be to lead by an example maybe if someone show other the proper way to drive they would want to drive good just takes one person to show others the right way."
7224,0,"Shoot the ball! Quickly! Swish that was the sound of my team winning the playoffs. Our principal decided that every student should attend at least on extracurricular activity. His decision has impacted us in a positive way. It's safe to say that I agree with his decision. An extracurricular activity can improve one's life emotionally, and physically. One gain in attending an extracurricular activity is that it can fix a persons body weight. For instance, being in a sports team or cheer leading requires a healthy diet and working out. If you don't complete these two tasks it could have you kicked from the team. This emphasizes the fact that an extracurricular activity such as sports can improve one's health. Who doesn't want to be healthy? Being in the basketball team overweight is a tough job. Especially when the students in the team must go to practice almost everyday. When they go to practice, they improve their skills in basketball and their stamina meaning they have to run a lot, it can be for any sport. Since the person is already doing their workout in practice, all they have to do outside is eat healthy. Now thats easy! Within months this person could have lose tons of weight and maybe even started to get abs. Sports, an extracurricular activity, has already knocked down the health factor in ones life. Social life is another factor in which an extracurricular activity touches upon. It can help someone make new friends that take interest in the same things as themself. One can join the art or the yearbook editing club and meet people that enjoy drawing, and painting as much as them. That student could potentially have found a new friend that they can share their stories or ideas with. This shows that just one extracurricular activity could bring a student one step closer to their peers. This works the same with any sport as well. Sports also have the ability to make a student connect with others. Moreover, it can help a person communicate better with the friends they already have. If one is having difficulty coming up with ideas to talk about with their friends, they can join a club or do sports. This will give each of them something to talk and discuss about. They could talk about how practice was or what they drew in the art club today. These extracurricular activities provide some people with something to talk about with their friends. An extracurricular activity can help with teamwork, being open to other people's ideas, and sharing a student's own ideas. It can improve the way students consider other ideas coming from different people. If a student decides to serve the student council they have to think about all the others that are also a part of their team. These students have to keep in mind that students around the school might give suggestions on what one should improve. This means that an activity such as, this one can improve the way a student might think about an idea a different student could have suggested. Since, these students are in the student council they have to find a way to come up with a decision that implements everyone's ideas. If a student is working on the yearbook they must find a way to add every person's art in it. Even if it means changing it up a little. Teamwork is a big part of joining an extracurricular activity. Though one may not like a person who is the same club, one still has to consider their thoughts as well. Furthermore, a student might not have the confidence to share their own ideas until they join a club or extra activity. When this person see's that people in the student council are being open about their ideas, he/she might start to share. Hiding ideas inside of one may not show their full potential. Extracurricular activities help get rid of that fear a students might have. Extracurricular activities can make one more confident in their own ability. It not only enhances a student's social skills but also creates a path to a better school life. I believe that the principal's decision was impactful because of all the benefits one can get. Teamwork, health, and social life are not the only enhancements that extracurricular activities provide a student and the whole school with. Lets go collect our trophy guys!!!"
12148,0,"The Face on Mars The Face on Mars is a natural landform. The formation is just another Martian mesa. Many conspiracy theorists get too overwhelmed when they see this face, because they are so eager for scientsists to find life on another planet. Although it looks as if something made the Face, it was made naturally. First, the Martian mesa is very common around the area of Cydonia. It was not a big surprise to some scientists to find that it was formed naturally. NASA revealed the image captioning, ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" The unusual shadows made the landform seem to be a human face. Next, the Mars Orbiter Camera team captured a photo that was ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. This made the picture even more accurate. When the picture was first unveiled on a JPL web site, people found that the Face was a naturally landform. It was not caused by aliens or other life forms. Then, Malin's team took a clearer photo than the 1976 Vikining picture. Malin's team's captured a picture on April 8, 2001, in which each pixel spaned 1.56 meters compared to the 43 meters per pixel in the Viking photograph. According to the article, you can distinctly view objects three times bigger in a digital image than the pixel size. In paragraph 11, the author says ""So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" The 2001 picture shows that the Martian is equivalent to landforms that are common near the American West. Ultimately, the research and pictures were clear, the landform was not made by any life forms. The Face was formed naturally. The Martian mesa is very common in the area of Cydonia, where it was found by. Scientists and their teams captured photos that showed that this was landform was caused naturally. With the technology the scientists like Malin used, it is easy to tell that there was no aliens that affected the mesa."
3668,0,"Have you ever thought to yourself about how summer projects affect students? Some schools have started to require students to complete a summer project, Should the projects be student-led or teacher-led? The following reasons are why I believe summer projects should be student-led: It would allow the students to broaden their topic range, It would make sharing the projects more enjoyable, and It would allow students to reflect on their summer. Giving students the opportunity to choose the topic of their project would allow the students to talk about everything they did over the summer. This allows students to choose anything they did, from taking a peaceful vacation to skydiving over Generic_City. Students would be able to adventure and begin an amazing life that has so many roads to follow. Many students would benefit from the projects and would have many stories to tell. Another reason students would enjoy self-led projects is because giving the students freedom to share their projects with other classmates. Sharing the projects would give students many things to talk abou when they come back to school and see eachother. Students by sharing could teach new things about eachother such as what their hobbies are. With students sharing their projects it forms new bonds and create new friendships between many unlikely people. Sharing projects would bring people together more and overall be great for everyone, it gives students necessary life skills such as: public speaking, communication skills, and essentially confidence. Allowing students to conduct their projects would be beneficial to students becuase they would have time to sit down and think about all they did. The project itself isn't really about the actual project, It's about students thinking and knowing they made pretty awesome memories over the summer. The projects shouldn't be about school work such as math or a history project. It should be about the students and helping them do their best to live their young lives to the fullest. In the end the students would be out in the world making memories with people in their community, they would be making a difference in the world they could travel and help with disaster relief, students could make a change in this world and the next. While some people may say that teacher-led projects could be best. I believe they are wrong, Nothing could make student mental and physical health go up other than to actually give students the freedom to complete a project and show they made a difference over the summer. Making the difference wouldnt have to end when summer ends students could make changes year-round. In theory students starting to develop their own projects would lead to students just wanting to make a change and go adventure."
16768,0,"Can you imagine a time in the future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore? Well no I can't really imagine a time in the future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore. I can't imagine that because theres always gonna be a time where you need to go somewhere & your gonna need transportation to get you there. If there were no cars in the future so many lives would be so miserable because who would wanna walk everywhere they need to go? I know I would get tired of walking. There's so many places where people need to be on time but only with some kind kind of transpotation. Life wouldn't be so great without cars because just even walking the house or even to go down the street for something important would really get annoying & tired. When reading paragraph 7 it talks about how BMW announced the development of ''Traffic Jam Assistant in 2013. Well just because there were alot of ""Trafic Jams'' in 2013 doesn't mean just think about the future without any cars. We need transpotation everywhere we go. I know that there's many of ways for transportation but walking, I don't think that's really a great idea knowing that we walk 24/7 365 days out of the whole year. Having a car & knowing that you can drive it around anytime you would like to is actually good, because even though the gas that you put in your car goes up a dollar or 2 every week doesn't just give up or think about not having cars in the future. There are teenagers all over the world that are looking foward to getting them a car when they get older & even teens and adults now that are wishing that they could get them a car. My position on driveless cars is that what is a driveless car if you still need a driver to drive the car? You will always need someone to drive the car even if it is a driveless car. There are car crashes everywhere you go, but you can always fix that problem by sharing the road with the other drives. Watching out for other drivers and the people that are walking is a big step of getting behind the wheel. Making sure that there aren't other people in the way so that you will not hit them & even following the rules of the road, like making sure that you stop at STOP signs & even waiting for your turn to turn while driving. There's no need to imagine a time in the future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore."
1195,0,"What would you do if you got written a ticket by a police officer for just driving your car? It could happen if we had a day that driving was banned to help the enviroment. I think this is great idea and we shold all get involved with trying to make it work. Other countries have done it and it doesn't seem to effect anybody negativly. The only thing this would do is limit the pollution put off in America and all over. Cars are probably the biggest source of pollution in our world today. We use cars for eveerything now and it is very convenient but have you ever really thought of what they are doing to our atmoshpere and ozone. Smog is one of the biggest efects from driving and its not a pretty one. I wouldn't want my city to be covered in a thick layer of foggy gas fuems. In paris the smog was so thick they had to make driving outlawed for a few days just to keep it under control. If we did it even just a couple times a year nation wide it could really help. In columbia they tried this to help with car emisions and everybody enjoyed it. They even said other countrioes joined in so I think its our turn to give it a try. The people of Vauban, Germany have a pretty much car free town. If towns started going car free like this in America the emmisions would drop greatly. In Vauban evrybody really likes not needing cars and say it is much less stressful than driving everyday. If just one in every 20 cities of the United States went car free we would notice how much cleaner the air is and the greenhouse effect or global warming would be almost nonexistent. Another thing the articles mentioned is hybrid cars. I think hybrid cars are great, I personally have one, but some people don't really understand or like them. These cars could really help save the enviroment in just a few years if people were to start only using them. Which I doubt will happen but they still are driven by many people and its much better then everyone driving a diesel truck around all the time. In all honesty I don't think any of this will happen here anytime soon but it sure would be nice. The greenhouse effect is very real no matter how many people argue about it and there is thigs that can be done to help prevent it. We just have to be willing to make some sacrafices to save our planet."

And a big change like this would make alot of people mad and upset and posibaly riot. The electoral college is really not a college its a constitution as a compromise between election of the president. Electoral college consists of 538 electors. The electoral college process consists of the selection of the electors. Under the electoral college system,voters vote not for the president,but for the slate of electors. The single best argument againest the electoral college is what we might call the disastor factor. During the 200 campaign,seventeen states didnt see the candidtes at all.

The weight of the car pressed down on the lower half of my body with monster force. It did not hurt, my body was numb. All I could feel was the car hood's mass stamping my body father and farther into the ground. My lungs felt pinched shut and air would neither enter nor escape them. My mind was buzzing. What had just happened. I could smell the engine, And the burnt-chemical of the airbag propellant. The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving. Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. According to research cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at a four time greater risk of a crash. Despite of a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands. Moreover, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving. whose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to tragedy. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people. Opponents say that hands-free set is safety because people can drive using two hands. However, hands-free devices don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe. Researches show that using headset can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distracts drivers from focusing on the road. Scientists had proven that people talking over the phone image person who they talking to and that doesn't interfere with driving. The problem is when a car swerves unexpectedly or pedestrian step into traffic, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time. So the problem isn't in holding the wheel and cell phone at the same time what may cause an accident because of lack manoeuvre, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at the particularly time."
20728,0,my suggestion would be you are allowed to use the cell phones in school because it would be better cause it gets boring in school and we be able to have are phone on us all times and on cause really what if there was something wrong to your family you might want to know. and again we could use them in the halls and things like that and we don't have to get in trouble for having on cause everyone knows everyone brings a phone into school and you get in trouble and your mom has to come in the school and get it from a the teacher and that's a little regulus. It would be a good idea for phones to be allowed phones in free time and lunch and not class cause it would distracted you in class. I think we might be able just to text because if you distracted kids you will be in trouble and it want be a distraction if we all text and put it on vibrate so no one can hear the phone but just see it being use and don't have to hear any body's voice or anything. It would help the teachers waste there time busting kid for phones in there pockets or kids texting under neath the desk trying to cover it the want have to waste there times after school for just a phone but one they have a and the text and if they get to use there phones we get to its not fare leasing to there phones going off in class. all so its a waste of the schools time just for having that as a rule no phones in school its point less cause you know and we know that your are not going to stop us for bring are phone to school. so regardless if you still don't want us to have phones in school we are going to everyday all day until schools over so u can let us not have phones in school or u can think about wasting all the teachers times or let us bring are phones to school. they might just want to worry about kids and there studies and not care for a phones and care about all the fighting and all the kids making front of each other.

Then they know how to fix it and share he advice to the other people who need it. Now with technology people dont need that advice all they need is to just Google it and bam there it is. What if you cant find it on the internet then you need to turn to the people and their advice to help you in these kind of situations. you need advice to get you through life it will help you. then it comes back to you and how you handle it. you can choose to listen to the advice or to not listen. in today s world you just have to learn not to care. FALSE you do need to care about people. now you need to listen to peoples advice it can and will get you through life and it will help you. you should stop and listen to peoples advice and see how that would help you and benefit the others around you. OK final joke of the day why did the chicken cross the road? I don't know you make that one up yourself. I mean come on its not like I am made of jokes jeez cut me some slack people. You need listen to peoples advice they will help you in tough times. It helps to have people you know that can help you through tough time with their own advice to you and will help you push through it. When I am down and out of it, I ask my grandma for advice, because she helps me get through tough times. She will help me and I know she is a shoulder I can lean for advice. My mother she helps me do things I didn't even know I cold do with her helpful advice. My family and friends our good people to turn to when I need advice to get me through tough times. When I get advice from anyone it doesn't matter who it is, I will take it to heart and do my best to follow and listen to it. ""Do or Do not there is no try""- Yoda. That is a good advice to live by. it tells you need to do your best or not do your best but you can not try. You want to do your best in this world and not try to do your best in this world. That is good advice to live by. In this world with everything that goes on you need stop and think about some advice someone gave you one time and take to heart and think about what it means. Then you need to go and do best in the world with the advice in mind. Next you do your best and then past it off to other people and help them as well. It will make you feel good in side that you did something good in the world. In this time that I had with you I talked about how people can give advice, not one person, but multiple personal can give you good advice to live by, then we talked about how it helps in the work environment with other people around you to give them advice that they can listen to and do their best at as well, Then we talked about how good friends and family can help with advice you can get from them, next we talked about how it could benefit the person that told you the advice, then we talked about how it could benefit you and the others around you, and we final talked about how you need to do your best and not try your best at stuff. Now you see it is easier in life when someone gives you advice to listen to. It is best to listen and take the advice to heart and do it. It will make you feel better. all you have to do is give a single word of advice. Then that should get it all going for something great to happen. It will all come back to your advice that you gave and will come back around to you. You will feel great about what has happened. Just a single piece of advice can go a long way for some people. That is called the butterfly effect. This will make you feel like you could POP from the joy that you just felt. One thing is it."

18544,0,"Driverless Cars is a great idea, these cars would make a huge change in the world because these cars would be really helpful, but there are some adventages and disavenges of the use of these cars, one adventages is that can drive by themselves, but a desaventage is that if the sensors don't work what would happen?. Driverless cars would be really helpful for people and mostly for people that travel a lot they fall sleep, these cars would help them by taking control and so no one get hurt. Driverless cars have sensors that help to create a 3-D model of the car's surroundings so this would help the car to see if there is any danger and if the is the car will notify the driver to take over and take another options. Cars like these ones are a great idea, it will allow the drivers to take a rest when they are tired. Cars like driverless cars are not perfect and they are not 100 percent safe, these cars can be really expensive too and not everyone would buy them. About safety the sensors that these cars use what if they don't work? what would it happen? if the sensors don't work the cars will not alert the driver if there is any danger and this will end up in an accident and would not be good for the manufacturer and the owner, these were some reasons why the manufacturers want to put cameras in the cars so the car can see the driver and know whether the driver can drive or cannot drive. Some manufacturers like GM they have developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger. Other car that tells the driver when they should take over the car is the Google car. Cameras in cars can help a lot because while the driver is watching the road the car is watching the driver. Some manufacturers are considering bringing entertainment for these cars and information system that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned off when the driver needs to take over. This new tegnology in cars is really good, but how much these will cost? No one knows yet. I strongly agree with the develop of the driverless cars because this will really help peole and will help to reduce the cars accidents. Driverless cars are defenitly are great this new tegnology will allow the driver to take a rest and then take over any time. The sensors that the cars have help to avoid any danger. Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have these new cars drive themselves by 2020, the cars they try to make will be the best option to have less cars accidents in the future."
9637,0,"The author believes Venus is a worthy pursuit depite the dangers. There is lots of evidence to support the authors claim. I personally agree with the author that we should look into Venus more. Venus could be suitable for humans. The author shows this by telling ""temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy condiotions but survivalbe for humans."" Venus can be suitable for humans, it just would be very difficult starting off. Soon enough humans would adapt to the hostile environment of Venus. Venus could have to be humanities future if we keep polluting Earth. Venus could be suitable yet harsh, but still needs to be learned about a lot more. We still know only the bare minimum of Venus. Venus is very hostile. Humans would not be able to survive on an atmosphere that is 97 percent carbon dioxide. It's clouds are highly corrosive with sulfuric acid, and temperatures are averaged over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. It would take a very great amount of effort to make Venus a new home. But if it is studied more we may be able to make it a place to stay. Overrall I think it would be smart to learn more about Venus. It could potentially be a new home. Venus seems to be almost as promising as Mars does right now, but still we need lots of information. The author had very good claims, and I agree with them. If we put more into studying Venus I believe it would help humanity."
14036,0,"Dear Principal, There are rumors going around that you might make it mandatory for the students at the school to perform community service hours. I believe that it may be helpful for some students to perform community service because it could keep them out of trouble or serve as their punishment for misbehaving regularly but it could also hinder some students. Some students at the school are well behaved but aren't doing well with their grades. So instead of performing acts for the community they could be studying to improve their grades. With the improvement of grades in the school the students will most likely have less stress on getting their homework finished or working in class and will be more attentive in class. Another reason not to have community service is that some students have activities outside of school. Sports is a very important activity to some athletic students in the school because that is how some of them are paying for college. If you take that away from them then they might not get a scholarship to the college that they want. If we do have community service then it should be for students that are doing excellent in schoolwork but not make it mandatory. To make students that are doing well enough in school want to work for the community, there should be a reward for the most hours performed. This way if the students not doing well in all of there classes want to earn the reward they will work harder to do well and get in the race for the prize. The entire school's grade point average will raise if they are willing to work for the prize. The prize should be something grand and well thought out. It could be a certificate to a restaurant or a few concert tickets. If the entire school does well enough, we should be able to go on a ""fun field trip."" With these ideas there will possibly be many community service hours performed and grades improved. Please take this letter into thought when you decide on making community service mandatory or not. Sincerely, A concerned student."
10842,0,"The Facial Action Coding System I believe to be a great idea. The Facial Action Coding System begins when the computer construcrs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Using something like this could be good or bad, because maybe not all students or parents feel comfortable with teachers being able to read their childs emotions. Being able to read some students emotions may help with potential problems with the child to see how they are really feeling. One main reason I am for this invention is in paragraph 6 in the artical it says "" A classsroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"", Dr. Huang predicts ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. The Facial Acting Coding System might actually be more accurate than you think, because the creaters have thought ahead, maybe you're feeling a certain way but the computer say differently, or your exspressions for some emotions could be slightly different than oothers. Paragraph 4 in the artical "" even though individuals often shoe varying degrees of expression"" ( like not smiling as broadly). Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements- in a real face. By weighing the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared against a neutral face. In conclusion your home PC can't handle something as complex as decoding Mona Lisa's smile. But it can write down simple instructions that ""encode"" differnt emotions."
22438,0,"Schools that offer distance learning benefits students in many different and unique ways. Being able to do school online is a great way to go at a pace you desire. Whether you're a fast or slow learner, it could really help students in the way they learn. Also being able to have all the free time after finishing your classes without no distractions is a great feeling. You'll be able to have all the time you need to use this time productively. Student that go at their own desirable pace will most definitely improve the way they learn. As for many students, they have difficulties trying to catch up with their classmates because they're slow pace learners. It could be quite uncomfortable for some students to ask questions every single time they need help without them thinking they're slowing down their class. Online classes really benefit those slow pace learners so much by letting them learn at a pace they're most comfortable with. As for some students, they don't feel comfortable or focus well in school. Students should be able to feel comfortable at an environment they're familiar with. Some students feel more secure and focused in their comfort zones, which for most of us; it's our own homes. Attending classes from home help students say focus without any other students distracting them in their learning; for example, classmates slow teachers down by disrupting them which causes teachers to lose focus as well. How will student be able to focus and learn while there's other students distracting them from their learning? Another benefit for online school is being able to have more time to yourself. Because you're able to go at your own pace without any distractions, there's a good chance for students to finish early. This gives them all the free time to do something productive like: do homework, study, house chores, etc. If you do extra curricular activities or sports, you'll have a bunch of time to practice with your team too. All these are great examples of why online classes are beneficial for so many students. By improve their learning, focusing without any distractions, going at a pace they're most comfortable with, and having all the time to study. Students will definitely agree with recommending other schools to offer online class for their students too."
772,0,"Cellphones are a part of everyone's day to day life. We find out information, contact others, even kill time using these tiny little computers. It sometimes seems like we couldn't survive without such an essential device, but in reality it may cause more harm than good especially if used in the wrong situations. The ""National Safety Council"" reports that there are more than 1.6 million crashes every year due to texting and driving. It has become one of the nations highest causes of death. Almost every state in America has banned it and in some eye's it should be enforced more than it is. The use of your cellphone while driving is extremely dangerous and should not be allowed or even accepted in society. While driving at the speed of 55mph if you close your eyes for even 5 seconds then you've already driven the distance of a football field. Now imagine that every time someone looks down at their phone to read or respond to a text for 5 seconds they have already endangered all the other people that were in that football field's length of road. Although it may seem very minor at first to just look down for a second, it is very dangerous. Even though in some situations it may seem like it's an emergency and you need to reply at that moment, it is always safer to pull over and deal with it then. Risking other people's lives is not something that should be taken lightly. With how updated and modern our technology is now a day's, there should be absolutely no reason to text and drive. New technologies have given the ability to use your phone hands free and be able to text or call without ever looking away from the road. In Georgia there was a law implemented that requires every driver to have this hands free system set up in their car. This in return has caused many drivers to put the phone away and just use the vocal features. The hands free law has saved many people's lives but there are still many phone users behind the wheel. To sum this up, texting and driving is very dangerous. Putting others lives at risk or even your own just to send that couple word text is not worth it. There are many ways of avoiding this problem, like simply pulling over, or using bluetooth and letting the information be told over the air. Many people would feel safer on the roads and maybe even take in some of their surroundings and be more alert. If this was taught to young teenagers before they got their driver's license then many of their crashes would have been avoided."
24002,0,"""NO SCHOOL ON MONDAY!"" The first text I recieved from a friend after Generic_Schools announced that students didnt have to attend school on the 16th of March. We were then informed by FCPS that they would use that Monday to prepare teachers for the possibillity of having school online due to the coronavirus. Although, if this procedure for the coronavirus were to be followed, every student would be required to do distance learning but what if they gave kids the option of learning online for those who wanted to? Seeing that this will probably happen I started to realise all the benefits that distance learning had to offer such as the comfort and convinience from being at your own home. Many school counties have already switched to online school because of the coronavirus and I am constantly informed by my friends about how distance learning is the best thing thats happened to them. I always hear from education board members that ""school is always about the comfort of the students."" then why not offer distance learning? Anxiety is at an all time high for teenagers between the ages of 13-17 and although they can still attend school, how are they expected to be educated when they are too worried about asking a question or how other students view them? Giving the option for distance learning would get the students who were to nervous to ask their question to ask it without having the same nervous feeling as they did in regular school. Also those who are afraid of being judged for their clothes or outfits will no longer be afraid for they will be at a comfortable enviroment where they can wear what they want. These simple problems can be solved by offering distance learning for teenagers who have want the comfort of being in their own enviroment without people judging them for their actions or mistakes. As an athlete I have to miss some days of school due to tournaments or road trips but that can be resolved by offering school online. The convinience of having school online is impeccable and can potentionally keep kids from missing more school days then the average student does. Say a student is sick and cannot go to school, with distance learning the student can still get their education with the convinience of not leaving their home. I can see myself using distance learning when far away from school for it will be avalible to me aslong as I have internet connection. This convinience will give schools the opprotunity to give students education to everyone,anytime, anywhere in almost every situation. Although not everyone may have internet connection but they can still attend school. Distance learning will not be required but offered so if one does not have internet they will proceed to attend school how they usually would. Also if students wanted a more hands on learning they could just attend regular school instead of taking the class online. Having school online may be convienent but students could just skip class easily right? Wrong, due to the convinience of having school at home there would be almost no excuse for missing it other then oversleeping but then the teacher can just contact the students parent or guardian. I was asked by a peer ""wouldnt lunch and bathroom breaks not be a thing then?"" No, one would use the restroom and can eat lunch at their own schedule instead of having to constantly ask the teacher or wait for a set time to eat which is one of my favorite personal benefits of distance learning. Regular school isnt so bad but offering distance learning would be a good option for people to have. If schools offer distance learning they are giving students the option to having the convinience and the comfort of being at their own home. As technology develops and gets better and better I believe that distance learning will be far more beneficial then regular school in the future which is why I think that online school should be offered."

7159,0,"Over 60% of students who participate in extracurricular activities have a better chance of getting into college and getting a good job. My principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I agree with this decision because students would get more experience in school, they would become more productive, and parents would have more time to work. One reason why I agree that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, is because students would gain experience from it. If students participate in extracurricular activities they could gain experience from the the things they learned and the mistakes they made. For example, I am part of The Ambassadors Club, and this program has taught me how to manage my time, how to work with other people, and how to efficiently get work done, which I will need as I'm growing up. Students would get new experience if they participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Another reason why I agree that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, is because it will help the students become more productive. Most students at home have nothing to do, so they fill that time up by going on their phones, playing video games, or getting into trouble. One example would be myself because I am lazy, and I love to procrastinate. I would usually get my work done last minute, and I would always do the bare minimum. So, I decided to join a club at school, and I chose Drama Club. The club was very fun and exciting, and I learned a lot of new acting skills. Ever since I joined the Drama Club I have stopped procrastinating, and I have been more productive in school and at home. I believe that if students participate in at least one extracurricular activity they would be become more productive and would stay out of trouble. My last reason why I agree that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, is because it would give their parents more time to work. Many students have parents who work long hours, and their parents might have to hire a babysitter or might have to enroll their child into daycare, which both are very expensive. Parents might not have enough money to provide their children with a babysitter or day care, so they have to get off work early so they can take care of their child/children. For example, my sister, who goes to the same school as me, comes home at around 2:30 pm, but my parents don't come home until around 4:00 pm. So our parents had to hire a babysitter, but all of the babysitters were to expensive, so our parents had to get off of work early just to take care of her and to make sure that she is safe. After a month of leaving work early, my mom signed my sister up for Step Team, which my sister says is really fun. Now my parents don't have to leave work early because of the extra hour and a half that my sister is at Step Team. If students participate in at least one extracurricular activity their parents would be able to work more, and they would be able to earn more money to provide for their children. All in all, parents would have more time to work, students would be more productive, and they would get more experience if students participate in at least one extracurricular activity. However, some people might think the new system is bad because students would want to relax or hang out with friends, but I believe that their are a lot more positive effects if students participate in an extracurricular activity. In conclusion, with this new system many parents will benefit from it, and many students will benefit from the new system as well."
17210,0,"Driverless cars, is this in our future? Driverless cars have become a growing topic in the past years. Recently, more information has become visible to the general public. Are these cars a good idea? I believe driverless cars are not needed in the near future. Development of these cars is an unneeded advancement in technology. Driverless cars, as of the technology we are now given, are not as reliable as an independent driver, they invade your privacy, and it would take more money to install technology in roads to be able to make use of these cars. Driving is a symbol of independence, in the sense that you are given the responsibilty and freedom to go virtually any location you please by driving yourself there. Self driving is a commonly used way of transportation amongst many individuals. Driving is a way of transporting ones self from point A to Point B. When most individuals are driving, the average spped exceeds 25 mph. Driverless cars are only reliable for simple driving functions up to 25 mph. ""The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. In fact, none of the cars are completely driverless."" If driverless cars were to become a prominent part of every driver's life, would it be very practical? In the article, the author states what the cars are capable of, even with the driverless technology, the car will never be fully independent. The car is not completley driverless, this will be an unneccassary advancement until manufacturers create a truly driverless vehicle. So, using these new cars may be seemingly pointless, as the driver will still need to be paying attention and the car has sensors to make sure the driver is paying attention. This leads me to my next point, is a driverless car worth giving up your privacy? Driverless cars not only have sensors on the wheels to make sure you are paying attention, they have cameras on your dashboard to ensure you are paying attention. ""Manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road. While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver."" While some people may argue this is for the safety of the driver, there is no valid reasoning that there should be a manufacturer watching your every move to ensure you are paying attention on the road. Cars that have been driven that are not driverless have been doing, overall, well. While drivers are able to pay attention to the road regularly, having a camera creates an unwanted pressure to the driver. Adding the pressure of knowing you are constantly being watched as a driver can raise your stress levels, resulting in frustrated driving. Frustrated driving is an unsafe form of drivng, where as driving while relaxed and unwatched, relieves the pressure of knowing you are not the only person in the car. In addition, in the current days and in the past, has there ever been a need for manufacturers to put a camera in your dashboard to make sure you are driving safely? The answer to that question is no. Drivers, while not being watched, are expected to follow the laws and pay attention. Using cameras in the car and invading the privacy of the driver is an unneccasary addition, as there will only be use for the driverless portion of the car for up to 25 mph; therefore there is no further reasoning to begin developing these new vehicles. If driverless cars are only useful for up to 25 mph, is there really any practical use for them? If driverless cars become the new form of transportation, there will be money involved that a lot of people do not have. Having smart cars requires smart-roads, ones that can communicate with the car to ensure the safest possible driving experience. ""These smart-road systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical."" When manufacturers create these smart roads complementary to their smart cars, who will be paying for them? The most likely answer is a raise in already inflated car prices. When the smart-roads are installed, hypothetically speaking, will the road be smart enough to communicate with all different manufacturers types of cars? Will they allow regular cars to drive on them? How long will the instillation take and will it be on every road? These are all things that require time and money. Manufacturers see the big picture of driverless cars running the roads, but that simply can not be the case, given all of the obstacles needing to be overcome and all of the questions that require answers. With all of the money it will require to run cars that are still dependent on drivers, will there be any valid reasoning to spend all of this money on new roads and new car development? With all of the advancements in technology, there should be a threshold to the items consumers want versus what they need. Manufacturers should not be trying to create new technology, but improving what they already have created. Using driverless cars, still require a driver to pay attention and take control after a certain point, invade your privacy by watching you with a camera, and require more money to create the new road systems and create new cars. In conclusion, I believe there is no practical reasoning that these cars should be further developed."
21271,0,"Dear, Principal The policy that i think is best is the first policy. I think the first policy is the best because the students get to have there phones out during lunch and other free times. If we had our phones out at lunch we could text our parents asking them if we can stay for a baseball game or a basketball game so they don't have to come and get us after school. Then if you did the first policy you would know that we had our phones off during school so no one would be texting during school. Another reason policy one is better is because we could call or text a family member or friend and tell them about an important meeting. Then if one of your family members are sick you could call or text them and see how they are doing. You could listen to music at lunch on your phone. If you was in a hurry for your next class you could take a picture of your homework assignment. If you was out sick that day you could text a friend at lunch time and ask him what the homework assignments was or you could text a friend and tell them what the homework was for that day. Then at lunch you could play games on your phone after you got done eating. You could take pictures with you friends.So the best policy that i think is the best is policy one. I hope you choose policy one because a lot of students would like it. If you choose policy one we will promise to have our phones off during the school day, and we will not text during the day."

The software detected in the Mona Lisa painting that she is ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" There are specific steps on how this software works. ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face."" The software detects emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise. ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal."" Most people can tell how their friend is feeling based on their facial expression. The passage says,"" By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions."" The new technology is surprising. The text states, ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" New technology is able to detect human emotions, even when the person is hiding them. "" To an expert, faces do not lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity is not being truthful."" The computer software can detect human emotions from paintings, picture, and in person."
20496,0,"Many people across the country would believe that having an Electoral College is good idea. Well, I belive thst it is not a good idea to continue having an Electoral College to chose our president because the people deserve to have their votes count. In the prcocess of having an Electoral College the poular votes do not count, only the slate of electors can vote for the canidate. That's not even the worst part to begin with. In source 2, it says that 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. That is more than half the amount of voters in the country! It even states ""In the same vein, faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's canidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" meaning that sometimes the electors would not always have the same idea in mind as the people have. To me that is a real bummer especially for the people in the state with those kinds of electors. Furthermore, the Electoral college may have a few benefits as it states in source 3. Fore example, it says ""The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate receives a majority of the votes cast."" meaning that barely anyone would vote in the state. But that is usually a rare ocasion and is easily avoided in every state. As individuals we would usually not avoid coming to vote in an election for certain positions especially when it comes to a president. Sometimes people would even let the Electoral College vote for them without the people knowing who they voted for. The Electoral College is supposed to represent their state towards a canidate but what if the state rarely has any electors to be represeted or doesn't have any at all? That is why it is up to the people to make their own decision in who they want to vote for and hopefully their vote counts. The Electorial College may be recomended to represent their state but they can never represent every individual's vote because not all people have the same canidate in mind and the Electorial College can only vote for one canidate. Overall, I think the Electoral College should be abolished in every way. It is the people's vote that should count not the electors. Some people may disagree but I still believe the Electorial College is not good for us. It is not truely fair to have the majority of popular votes on one canidate and still that canidate does not win due the Electoral College. So I can most certainly agree with what previous people and groups have said before such as Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S Chamber of Commerance, and the AFL-CIO.... To get rid of the Electoral College."
4058,0,"Should Schools Allow Student-Assigned or Teacher-Assigned Summer Projects? How many times have teachers assigned summer projects, yet you only get half of the students' projects? Aren't you tired of getting only half your students' projects and having to chase students down to complete their projects. When will you learn students aren't interested in teacher-assigned projects. Why not give something else a try, like student-assigned projects. Instead of teacher-assigned summer projects, why not try student-assigned summer projects. It allows to student to be creative, work independently on projects like they will in future, and get students interested in their projects. For schools to assure students continue learning effectively over the summer they should allow summer projects to be student-assigned. Schools allowing student-assigned summer projects allows students to design and customize their own projects to their own interest. Being able to allow students to pick a topic you're passionate about gets students interested in their summer projects. Since students are allowed to pick their own topics, the project is on something that they're interested in. Students have a chance to choose a topic they have an interest for or are passionate about. Therefore, this sets students up to become immersed in their summer projects. Student-assigned summer projects allows students to explore new topics that can spike interest for students to pursue a possible, future career path. Having projects be student assigned allows students to work independently on projects as practice and preparation for independent study projects for college. In college student-assigned projects or independent study projects are assigned often, especially in STEM fields. To help students prepare for college, student -assigned summer projects will give them a preview as to what it is like to do an independent project. Students all ready feel high schools don't prepare them for college, but student-assigned projects can get students that needed preparation for college. Schools allowing student-assigned projects are helping their students to receive necessary preparation for college. Some educators and students believe that teacher-assigned projects are the better choice over student-assigned projects. They think it will give more structure to the project, projects will explicitly follow the curriculum, and students will know exactly what they have to complete for the project. However, all teacher-assigned projects do is stifle creativity, lose student interest, and cause students to become more dependent on teachers for ideas. For example, whenever I have teacher-assigned projects I get excited about the project, but I forget about the rubric. Once I remember there is a rubric to be followed, all of my creative ideas for the project dissipate because they don't follow the rubric guidelines. Student-assigned projects allow for more creativity, students aren't bound by a rubric. Schools should allow student-assigned summer projects, since it allows students to open up their minds and become creative thinkers. Teacher-assigned projects stifle the creative young minds of students. Assigning independent student projects allows students to independently explore their interest, prepare them for college, and lets students use their creative brains to learn. Student-assigned summer projects help students learn effectively over the summer break."

This skyrocketing campaign has led to as many as 7 million people giving up cars for the day, which reduces air pollution, promotes exercise, and avoids traffic jams. This may seem like a strange phenomenon, but reduced driving is spreading all around the globe. Just to name an example, there are multiple towns who have also caught on; such as Vauban, Germany where only as many as 30 percent own cars. There are multiple advantages to reducing cars from our lifestyles. A very large pro is how much we can reduce Greenhouse gasses. Not too long ago, there was a long span of near-record amounts of air pollution in Paris, France. In an attempt to fix this issue, they came up with a plan. The scheme was decided to order Even-numbered license plates to leave their cars behind for the day, or be fined $31 (22 Euros). Odd-numbered cars would be told the same would apply for them the following day. Unfortunately, approximately four thousand people were fined, with twenty seven others having their cars impounded. just after five days, the smog was so thick that it rivaled one of the most polluted areas in the world; Beijing, China. along with the weather, much of the smog was blamed by the massive amounts of diesel fuel that France uses. Many complained, but after accepting free public transit, and exceptions for hybrids and electric cars, the smog cleared enough for the French to take back the ban. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the united states,"" Claims Elisabeth Rosenthal, who wrote ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"". In response to some of these things, a recently finished city in Germany has completely car-free roads (with a few exceptions). This is because of a few reasons. Firstly, Vauban, Germany doesn't have any parking, driveways, or garages. the only place you can park is in either of the two large parking garages that you would buy a $40,000 parking space for, along with your home. This has resulted in seventy percent of the population of Vauban to be without cars, and about fifty seven selling theirs to move here. Suburbs like these have been trending all across Eurpope. In return, this has provied the community with less traffic, much less pollution, and the creation of denser cities so it's better for walking to and from the shops and resturuants on mainstreet. According to Heidrun Walter, who is a mother of two, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" With more walking, and less sitting at the wheel, this can also provide more social interactions. Many people now ride bikes together to and from work, and there is less stress from traffic jams due to packed streets. This way, enviroments are more relaxed, open. Even for those who don't give up driving completely, now carpool and travel in groups to reduce gas use and air pollution. This trend has even begun to spread to the United states, the car capital of the world. Although the Vehicle's immense popularity, the density of usage here has finally started to decline. Teens are getting their licenses later, and not even getting a car until much after. This is also a good thing for multiple reasons. There are less reckless teenagers roaming the streets, and much safer roads, along with the help of Carpooling, there is much less gas being used, and more excercise when people decide to ride their bikes or walk places. There are numerous reasons we should reduce driving, Let it be reducing air pollution, promoting exercise, and avoiding traffic jams. even if we take small steps, we can create a much healthier lifestyle with just a small change."
25920,0,"Have you ever asked one person for advice? Maybe he or she is the only person you ask for that. If that's the case, then you should get into asking more people for advice, because you can improve your social skills, and it can help you understand how other people see things. Improving social skills can make it easier for people to ask for advice. When asking for advice, people need to self- advocate, express feelings, and more. If none of that is done, then how else will they get what they need? Social skills is also another way of making friends. The more someone has, the easier it will be to get the best advice. There are students in school that don't feel comfortable talking to a teacher or consular, because they dont feel secure with themselves. Social skills can be a great way to get advice from them, because that can teach students how to be secure, and it get what they need if their friends can't help them. Seeing other viewpoints can be a great way for people to get advice. If a friend says something, and another friend says something else, then it will be good to understand why they are saying what they said. It is recommended to experience both viewpoints and decide which one fits best, if needed. When both perspectives dont fit, there is always someone else with something completely different. In conclusion, improving social skills and seeing other perspectives is a good way of saying that people should ask more than one person for advice."
17208,0,"The future is coming. In this modern age, we have personal assistants on our phones, holographic keyboards, and even 3D TVs. It's not that far fetched that soon we could also have self-driving cars as well. Self-driving cars are quickly becoming a reality, but they first should be tested so no hazardous glitches remain. Recently there have been multiple breakthroughs that have advanced progress on making an actual self-driving car. One such advances was the more advanced sensors that are now put on cars. Now, these sensor help alert drivers to where a possibly dangerous situation is, but in the future they could be used as the ""eyes"" for the car. No car would be able to drive on it's own without being able to sense which direction it's going. As well there have been multiple breakthroughs with computer systems, which would give the car the know-how in order to drive on it's own. Lastly, thanks to satellite imaging, almost the entire world has been mapped out. This, added along with everything else, could really help realize the future of the self-driving car. Now even though this idea sounds fantastic, it's not without flaws. Sometimes computers will suffer errors in their programming. Most of the time, this isn't too important, but if it happened to a self-driving car with someone in it, the results could be disasterous. The cars would need to be heavily tested to get rid of as many of these errors as possible. As well, there would also have to be a new set of laws that pretain to self-driving cars. One such law would be if a car crashed, who would be responsible, the passenger or the manufacturer? Self-driving cars are quickly becoming a reality, but first they need to be tested to make sure they don't have any hazardous glitches. In this modern age, we have personal assistants on our phones, holographic keyboards, and even 3D TVs. It's not much of a stretch of the imagination to think that self-driving cars could arrive soon.

Even though Google cofounder Sergey Brin can, I'm not ready to put my life nor my family's life on the line even after years and years of people testing them and making the driverless cars 100% safe. Electronics always mess up somewhere down the road, even 100% safe, so why trust a driverless car when it could mess up and put your whole family's life on the line. In the text it say's that ""Driver's need to stay alerted at all times"" but why if this car is 100% safe, aren't we aloud to sit and talk to are family while we are on the move. The text also stats that ""If there is a wreck who's going to be the blame, the owner of the driverless car or the manufacturer"" so why buy it if you might be the one to blame and not the manufacturer who made this 100% safe driverless car. My points go to prove why I'm sticking to a car I can personally drive and not a car that's still not 100% safe on the road yet. So I ask you, would you like to move on with the rest of the world and put your life and other people's lives at risk every day with a driverless car or a car that you can drive and help keep others safe. Stay safe and go against the flow sometimes, could be for the best."
4545,0,"Summer projects are never fun, whether they are made by students or a teacher, at the end of the day, it takes away time of a students summer. The summer is a time for students and teachers to relax, but students often forget most of the information they learned during that past school year. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because students may make the assignments too easy and put in no effort, teachers can give the assignment based on what they learned and what they need to know for the following year and, the teachers will be able to grade it faster and will help get a better understanding about which students are struggling in what areas of the subject. When making a student create a project or assignment, most students are going to make it as easy as possible with no real challenge. There are some that will make it challenging and beneficial, but others won't try and will get no information out of it. If the teacher makes the assignment, they can put the right information that they need to know for the assignment and really challenge the students to actually think about what they are doing. The teacher doesn't have to make it super difficult but find a balance of challenging and able to do. The assignment may take a long time to do but it will help prepare the students. Sometimes when students get extra help from a tutor or an online program, they get information that they don't need to know and then they study that information. With teacher-designed assignments they can give the students the right information so they know the exact information they need to. While the teacher could just give the student a rubric, the teacher can give specific examples and further information to the students. When the teacher creates the assignment they can also give information and examples that are used in the following year that they will need to know. Getting a head start on information needed for the following year will benefit students a lot, because if they go get extra help they will be ready for the class and know some of the material already. If the students make the assignment the teacher will have to dig through and try to find all of the information they asked for, but if they make it themselves, all they have to do is check for the parts in the place they are supposed to be at. Lots and lots of teachers always complain about the massive pile of papers they need to grade, but all they have to do is put the information and example in one place and they can just check it off. Also while doing this, the teacher can easily see where the students are struggling and how exactly to help them. Sometimes teachers struggle to find ways to help struggling students because it could be the way the teacher is explaining it or the student just doesnt understand the material. The faster teachers are able to grade the assignments the faster they can help the students because if the assignment isn't graded and it's been too long, the student will be even more lost than before. Teachers will have the final decision and will choose what they think will help the students learn the most. Some may say that the summer assignments should be student-designed, however, the teacher designed assignments will get the exact information to the student. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because students may make the assignments too easy, teachers can give the assignment based on what they learned and what they need to know for the following year and, the teachers will be able to grade it faster and will help get a better understanding about which students are struggling in what areas of the subject."
20267,0,"When electing the president of the United States, you must vote in favor of the president you want. However, instead of coming down to popular vote, the system uses the Electrolar College to decide. The Electroral Vote works in that the people of a certain states votes for their candidate and the majority of people who vote for a certain president give their votes to a slate of voters. What this means is that the popular vote within a state wins the electoral votes of the electors who then vote for the president. Many people dislike this system including myself. I disaprove of this system because it limits representation, permits the disintrest of voters, and reduces a candidates intrest in a state. One major problem with the Electoral College voting system is that it limits representation of the people. The Electoral COllege votes work so that the population of a state directly effects the amount of votes that states recieves. For example, Wyoming only has about 500,000 voters so it only recieves one electoral college vote. Because there is only one vote for wyoming, the 500,000 voters do not have acurate representation in a vote that has a total of 270 electoral votes. There have also been times in which a president has won the piopular vote but lost the Electoral College vote. This was seen in the 2000 vote of Bush versus Gore when Gore won the popular vote and Bush won the electoral vote. One might claim that because the amount of electoral votes for a state is based of the population, it is fair. However, I believe that the popular vote is more fair because it expresses the opinion of the majority. In some states, there is a large majority of people running for a single party. This can be observed primarily in Texas where an overwhelming majority of voters are Republican. Therefore, the Republican president wins Texas almost every election period. This can be frustrating for Democrats who live in Texas because they know that their vote does not matter causing them to lose interest in voting in the first place. This is not fair for those people nor is it particularly good to express as an American trait. As stated before, the larger the population of a states, the more Electoral College votes that state gets. This leads to a small group of ""big states"" that have such a large amount of votes, they are the target for candidates to try to persuade to vote for them. On the opposite side of the spectrum, most of the other 50 states have a smaller amount of votes and are less of an objective for candidates to acquire. In many states throughout an election preiod (the period in which candidates move to diferent states giving speeches) the candidates never make an appearance in their state at all. This is observed in the 2000 election in which seventeen states did not have the candidate make an appearance at all. This also can lower interest in voting for the president. The Electoral college voting system is not fair in the way the present system works. The system does not show proper representation of the people, does not promote interest in voting, and causes a candidate to ignore the states in which do not have a large amount of electoral votes. Moving to popular vote will fix all of these problems and will improve the way we vote for our president."
17822,0,"I believe that driverless cars should be allowed for everyone. The cars could help certain people if they are occupied with something else. Some people may not be able to have a driverless car because even though it's driverless, they still have to be there in case of an emergency. Other people may just ignore the signals of the car and it could cause a wreck to occur. Driverless cars could benefit many people in many different ways. The driver may need to take an important business call, and they can do that while the car is still going. The person could also have an injury and need to go to the emergency room, but have no one else to take them there. If the person has children one of their kids could need something, so they could help them while still going where they need to go. Also, the driver could've woken up late and needs to hurry to work. They could finish getting ready in their car or eat their breakfast. They may need to finish their make up or brush their hair and you can't do that with both of your hands on the wheel and your eyes on the road. I also believe it would be diffucult to know who is at blame for a wreck. The car could mess up and it would be the manufacturers fault, but if the driver is not paying attention it would be their fault. The driver may not want to take responsibilty and admit to not paying attention to the signals of the car. The idea of having cameras in the car to watch the driver is very interesting. It may feel weird being watched by something, but it would help figure out who is to blame. The idea of driverless cars is a little frightening though. There are people that may take advantage of it and not pay attention to whenever they need to take control of the car. The idea is also excellent for someone that may need the time to do something else. I approve of the idea, but there is always the slight chance of someone messing it up. Hopefully if driverless cars become a thing, they will make everything safer and nothing bad will happen because of them. If driverless cars become a regular thing, I think they need to be figured out and practiced with a lot more."
4804,0,"Summer project When summer break comes along, students tend to forget stuff of what they have learned through the year. Noting this, if student would create their own project they might not do it very well because they wouldn't know how they would start it or if they are doing it right. On the other hand, when teachers give advice and instructions to the students, they do better then trying to figure out stuff by themselves. Even though we probably know what we are doing it is better to know that you are on the right path. Sometimes we students just need a bit of a push to start us up. Teachers may affect a students way of being able to see things differently. For example, we learn more things when they are being taught to us rather then us trying to figure out ourselves. Having someone there for us helps us get farther since we have more support. When teachers design a school project, students know step by step on how to do things when the instructions that are given. We also know more things of how to do it the right way. Students can be great at designing things, but teachers can help us more since they know what we will need throughout our future and what it will hold for us. In order for teachers to be able to teach, they have to go through school themselves. In this case, teachers know what is important for us and what will help us go farther in our future. When teachers design their own project they can check if students are doing it right by making them present them. When students present their project the teacher can tell if they did something wrong and can help them fix it right away, but when students do their own projects it would be harder for them to understand what part they messed up and how would they be able to fix it. Work gets more easier when you know what you are doing. I would be able to understand on why people would think student select is better than teacher select because students would be able to express the things they know and remember. By dong this, students can show on what they have learned from what the teachers have taught throughout the school year. This is a good thing but it is better to be safe then sorry and be sure that we all are on the right track. Another reason might be that students would be able to get creative with their projects and i agree with that, but what would be the point of them being creative and doing it absolutely wrong. When you do a project that you made yourself you won't stay on topic for some time because the information being placed would be about anything. teachers do a lot for us and help us get into the right path for our careers but they also want us to know the important things we will need in are lives. They want us to be successful and help us understand things that we might need later on in our lives. They will be their with us every step of the way to show us and let us understand on how to do things right and help us understand things so it can be more clear. By doing this, they give us instructions on how to do better so this is why my opinion is 'teacher select project' is better and has more advantage of 'student select project'."
20796,0,"Cell phone policies are always an issue in schools around the U.S. In my opinion schools should ban cell phones. Me being a student myself I know exactly what students would do. Students would have the temptation of bringing their phones to classes which don't allow kids to have their phones, they would be a cause of distraction, and detract from a child's educational time. Kids spend more time on their phones than studying. If phones were allowed in the school during free periods kids would be more likely to bring their phones to classes that aren't free periods. This would cause more kids to face consequences with the administration. If kids traded their phones for books kids would be more educated. Phones are distracting and everyone knows that. If you were to allow students to have phones during the day it would cause more distractions within a day that don't occur already. Phones are always an issue and will always be an issue. As a student I need to practice what I preach because I am one of those kids who need to trade my phone for a book. Besides being distracting the phones would also detract from someone's learning. Instead of concentrating on school work kids would be focused on when they would get to use their phones. It would most likely lower kids' grade point averages. It would be an even bigger issue for the country then. So why not stop it now. Although it would be nice to have the privilege of having your phone during the day, I am against having your phone during the school. Many kids would object to my response but phones are tempting, distracting, and detracting."

A place known as Vauban, located in Germany has over 5,500 residents and only 30 percent of them own cars and 57 percent sold a car to move there. People said that they lived much better lives without a car in (source 1), smog and toxic car feums don't clog the city air allowing it to be free for people to walk outside and smell the fresh air. Some cities even enforce not to drive, such as Paris if you drive through certre areas you will be fined 22-euros ($31). Enough smog clear after people saw they were getting fined. There are some areas of the United States where greenhouse gas emissions are 50 percent, not only does this cause health related problems but also the it effects the environment, to help this the ""Environmental Protection Agency is promoting""car reduced"" communities, and legislators are starting to act."" This means that bills will be past to have certin areas have cars reduced. This increible idea really helps everyone and will help the future, some say its the end of the car culture. Different bills are being passed to help communities reduce emission of the gases that come from cars that effect the environment and certin health problems. Such as New York, they started a new bike-sharing program. Some people within the ages of 16-21 have started new proritys and have organized themselfs to not need the use of a car.

""The excutive chairman of Ford Motor Company. has laid out a business plan for a world in which vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable.""(source4) Even car companys see the cars are bad and want change for a brighter future. Limiting car usage or even no cars at all only have pros and is a very good idea for people who like to plan a good future and live in the suburbs.

In this entire article the fact that the ""self driving"" cars are not self driving is very present. There are some cars that need the passenger of the car to pay attention to the road more than others. This attentiveness that is required defeats the purpose of driverless cars. Some cars required more interaction than others. The BMW ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" requires the driver to constantly hold on to the steering wheel. In the acticle it even states that the cars cannot get themselves through sticky situation such as work zones or accidents. Other cars such as the Google car that use radar and sensors to replicate the car's surroundings are reliable on how the driver drove, and might be prone to malfunction causing accidents to happen. Once the boredom of not driving your car for the full time takes you away from the road you can become distracted. One BMW car even offers a built-in entertainment system that would distract the driver. Everyone has seem what happens when drivers become distracted now with the effects of texting and driving, imagine what would happen if the driver totally didn't have their eyes on the road. Whenever that replication fails or the driver gets distracted, the car would crash, and there would be a huge legal mess. Police officers and insurance agencies would be deamed the task of trying to find whose fault the accident is. Laws would be put in place after months if not years of debates on how these laws should work, and who to blame. This would take the attention away from more important topics that may need fixed sooner than later. The ""self driving"" car debate is a prime example of ""don't fix it if it isn't broke"". As evident in this article the cons heavily out-weigh the few pros that can be observed. The social and economic change on our world would be one that could impact everyone for the negative, as stocks would fall, tax dollars would be wasted, and car prices would majorly increase. ""Self-driving"" cars should be left as they are seem in the past, a figure of our imagination, that would only be in place in utopian societies."
15710,0,"dear principal, i highly disagree with having to have a B average in order to play sports. i disagree because a c meets the standards and not everyone is bright enough to exceed the standards and i don't think it's fair to have students make a B or better. another reason is because the teams may not have enough players to play if everyone needed a b average. the first reason, i disagree with the principal is because a c meets the standards and it's a passing grade. therefore students should be able to get ac and still play sports. also a B is exceeding the standards and all students aren't bright enough to have an exceeding grade that might deserve to be on the team. simultaneously, the teams may not have enough players to play if everyone needed a B average because everyone cant get a B average. then by the ti8me that everyone gets their grades up the season will probably be over. plus half of the students that do have their grades at a B average might not want to play the same sports that most others do want to play so that would make it even less players eligible to play for the teams. in conclusion, this is why i disagree with the principal and their decision of making students have to have a B average in order to play sports. one reason is there may not be enough players and another reason is its not fair. this is why we should able to play sports if we don't have a B average."
1578,0,"Cars are going to be gone in the near future. There have been talks and actions taken place to assure we limit our car usage. We as the United States seem to have pasted our use for cars as independent owners. We have also started several different programs or actions around the world to assure we stop pollution with the use of cars. Another way we have stop the use of car is car free days in some parts of the world. Also cars are believe to be stressful to human beings. In some parts of the world mainly Bogota, Colombia they have start to reduce the use of cars to avoid pollution and promote the use of other types of transportation. As it is stated in source 3: Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Selsky "" The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines."" This quote goes to show how we are starting to try to limit the usage of vehicles in this world. Also stated in source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog by Duffer ""Paris enforced a partial diving ban to clean the air of the global city. On Monday motorists wit even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day."" this shows that Paris even supports the limiting car usages by humans. Therefore us as the United States we have shown that even we are behind in our glory days of driving cars. As stated in source 4: The End of Car Culture by Rosenthal "" recent studies suggest that Americans as buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" So with that have been said we need to understand we drive no matter what but slow but surely we will stop driving in general. Due to the fact of that we do need to decrease our carbon release a pond the world. As it also states from article 4 or source 4 ""If the pattern persists-and many sociologists believe it will- it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind the power plant."" This quote shows how it will affect us and also how it will benefit us as well. Although driving feels amazing it gives you tons of stress to an individual. Not only that but it also makes you sometimes want to hurt someone. As well as feeling upset and sometimes wanting to cry due to a lack of funds to pay for gas as well as the worry of other drivers on the road. As stated in source 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Rosenthal a man states ""when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter. This goes to show us how we are affected by riving and even a little time away from the wheel can benefit us greatly. Another point on driving is stressful a man states in source 3: Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota he states It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" said Carlos Arturo Plaza. This goes and show a lot of people are in support of this act or idea. In conclusion limiting car use will benefit us in many ways but barely affect us at all. The main idea is to limit car usage and we can do that by the law that forces us stop car use in general. Another way we can accomplish this is by being an average teen in the United States. An added bonus is that we have loads of stress by driving. The limiting the use of driving is a way we should use to benefit us as human and to be more joyful."
24463,0,"When you go shopping or are picking something out you often ask for multiple peoples advice. Why do you do this? Well it's mostly because you want the reassurance from others. It is a natural thing that we all do. For instance last September my sister went homecoming dress shopping. She brought a bunch of people so we could all give our opinions. But at the end of the day does it really help? Well here is how it went and why I think multiple opinions help someone make a better choice. The first person my sister asked for there opinion was our Grandma. After a while of my sister coming out in dresses the first thing I noticed was my Grandma always asking ""Well what do you think of it?"" before giving her opinion. I think this is a very good way to give your opinion without hurting any ones feelings. You are asking how the feel about the dress before you put your thought in. But there are some disadvantages to that. Let's say she walks out of the dressing room in a dress my Grandma really doesn't like and she asked my sister how she feels about it and my sister says she loves it. Then you have a hard decision to make. Do you say you like it so you don't hurt her feelings or are you going to be honest and say you don't like it with the possibility of making her upset. Ultimately I know that even if I don't like to hear that they don't like it I would rather someone be honest with me then just lie and say they like it. And luckily that is what my Grandma did. And as a result even if that is not what my sister wanted to hear I could tell she was thankful for the honesty and took into consideration what my Grandma thought about the dresses. The next opinion my sister asked for was my mom. I knew even before this trip started that my mom was going to have a very strong opinion on each dress. And I was not mistaken. Each dress came with a ""thats too short"" or ""that shape does not flatter you and the color is to bright."" I could easily tell this was overwhelming my sister and stressing her out a lot. And that is one reason why getting multiple opinions can be bad but again sometimes after my mom said that my sister would look in the mirror and realize well maybe it is too short. I think this is one thing that happens a lot. You will put on something you like and when you show it to someone they point out something you maybe didn't think about or realize. One example is when I was at Target one time and I picked out a shirt that I really liked and when I showed my mom she remembered that I already had that shirt. If she had not been there I would have never known that and I would have gotten the exact same shirt I already had. So even though my mom can be brutally honest at least she can point out a lot of things you didn't notice and help you pick the right dress at the end of the day. The last opinion my sister got and the most important one was Beyonce. She has been a family friend for a while and my sister has always really loved her fashion sense. So when Beyonce heard that my sister needed to go dress shopping she was more then happy to come along. Her job was to help my sister pick out the dresses to try on and then give her opinion. Her way of giving her opinion was just to first point out all the things she liked about the dress and then something that my sister maybe want to consider. I think Beyonce was the best at giving her advice because she has to do it all the time with her music and what she wears for all of her performances. I think it can be very hard to get lots of opinions and not be overly influenced and not listen to your own opinion. So you have to makes sure even though you listen to everyone's advice you also listen to yourself and not just go along with what everyone says. But At the of all of this after Beyonce had given her final opinion and everyone had all agreed on a red dress that flared out at the bottom and had little white flowers. My mom agreed it wasn't too short and it was a nice color and my Grandma said it was absolutely beautiful and finally Beyonce said she was Grammy winning ready. After this very long and tiring journey I came to the conclusion that ever opinion is important ans really can help you make the best decision. I would highly recommend getting an opinion from everyone you can but make sure that you listen to your own opinion too. It can be especially hard with really big decisions and so for those I would still get a lot of advice from others but also take time to consider each option and like about the pros and cons."
7447,0,"I think that you can work on or do anything that you want to do. I agree that you can do any one of the activities that you want to do, because you get time indoors or outdoors. So i agree. 1. So if you wanted to play a sport you can just do that thing first before you do the other activities. Do you favorite activity first and then do the other. Do the one that is easier. Do the one that makes more since to you. 2. If you wanted to work on doing a yearbook. Have help on doing it. Work at your own paste. Set everything up right. 3. If you get called on a student council you probably have to do it. Do you best on trying it. Pay attention and dont mess around. Dont laugh or make much noise. I agree that you should have activities for school because you are getting exercise from walking and running around inside and outside. Then if you stay inside and outside everyday then you could have a better chase of make the team for whatever sport you are trying out for. If you want to just do one activity or sport then choose your own one to do. Like I would pick sports because I really like baseball and I also play baseball. Play at the position that you would usually play at. Also try to go in the order you think is the easiest. do the one that makes more since to you so if you play shortstop and you also play pitcher then take turns at both of the positions. Do which one is the best for you to do or play. If you wanted to work on a yearbook. Ask for help on it raise your hand so that someone can help you do it or understand it. Work at your own paste do what the teacher asked you to do and if someone else tried to mess you up just say no that is no going to go very well for you. Set all of the paper for it up right so that it would go well for you and it would also be easy for you. Also try your very best to do good on it and try to get a good grade on it. If you get called up for doing the students council you will probably have to do it. You would have to do your best and try to get a good grade on it. Pay attention in class and dont mess around. You might get in trouble or get a lunch detention. Dont laugh or make noise while the students council is going on because you might get in trouble you might have to sit out and not be able to do it and you could get a phone call home which would no be to good. So if anyone would choose between sports,yearbooks, or student counseling what would you do! I know that I would pick sports because I play a sport and the sport I play is baseball. I am always at my practices, I am always there on time. And since i am always there I am getting better each and everyday I go to my practices. So if I were to pick an activity to do it would be sports because i play baseball."
24607,0,"Multiple opinions can help people decide on what to do. When asking for an opinion you might want to ask more than one person because the person you ask might have better advice than the other person. Another reason is that people could have different personal opinions and points of view than others and their advice could help you out a lot in the future. When you ask for someones opinion you should listen carefully to what they have to say. Some people have better advise than others. I think people should ask more than juts one or two people for advice because people may have different points of view from others and you could agree with one or more people on something. If you only listen to one persons advice them you would have not known what other people had to say. The person you did not ask could have had really good advice but you would never know because you only asked one person. When ever I need advice I ask at least three people to see what they would say and what kind of advice they would give me. I listen closely to what they say and their advice could help me later. I listen to what everyone says and I think about what could benefit me either now or in the future. Like I said before people have their own opinions so if someone gives you advice that you do not agree with and you get upset just remember that everyone does not think exactly like you. People have their own personal opinions and they will sometimes tell you something that you do not like or want to hear. Now if someone gave you advice that you do not like do not ignore it take it as constructive criticism and listen to what they say and have a open mind about it. For example: Lets say you made some food and you add a little to much salt and your friend tells you that it is was to salty and that maybe you should have added less salt but you find the food to taste just right. Next time maybe dont add as much salt. This way you listen to your friends advice even though you disagree and if you find it alright and if they find the food better then you both dont lose nothing. And theres other ways to deal with this situation like not cooking that meal, but you decided to listen to your friends advice and in the end it all worked out. Its ok if people have different opinions then you and their advice isnt what you would like to hear but its good that you learn from them. In conclusion when seeking advice its good to ask more than one person because everyone is different and they will tell you different things. Some of those things could be bad advice but as long as you find the good in what everyone says and not just what one person says youll find the advice your looking for."
13651,0,"Dear principal, ""STUDENT_NAME, you should really come to the soup kitchen with me some time. It's really fun and the people are really happy that you're there."" This is something my friend suggested to me. I decided to go with her since I adore putting helping and putting a smile on people's faces. Therefore, i think it would be a great idea for students to be required to perform community service. For starters, there a lot of kids from our school that don't do anything out of school and the country is in need of extra help. Additionally, a friend of mine that goes to a different is required to do community service and he's happy and the princi To begin, there are many kids that go home from school and watch television and eat for the rest of the day. As a result, they become lazy and end up, in some cases, gaining weight from doing nothing. If more students are required to do community service, it would actually give them an opportunity to go outside or to be with someone and have company. For example, i know for a fact, that STUDENT_NAME would rather be building a house for the homeless than watch another episode of Grey's Anatomy. I think that the principal's decision will definitely affect everyone in a situation like this. Eventually, everywhere i look, there is a homeless person begging for money. Poverty is one of the greatest problems in the United States. I once gave a homeless person a single dollar and they were grateful to finally go and buy a hamburger at Burger King. Requiring students to be active in helping their communities is a good thought since some people, and students also, need some assistance. The students could help construct homes, feed the homeless, tutor the kids that can't go to school, etc. Last but not least, community service isn't necessarily a bad thing to be involved in doing. Some other school require kids to do the community service and if they don't have the required amount, then they get punished. This would be an idea for the principal to ponder. He could easily punish the students for not doing what they're required to do and that would motivate the kids. On the other hand, the principal could also give the kids incentives for doing community service. For example, giving prizes to the students that perform the greatest amount of hours of community service. That way, the principal would be satisfied helping his community and the students would also be happy by getting something in return for their hard work. In conclusion, i opinion that the great leader in the school should particularly make it mandatory for the pupils to do community service. It would give them something to do in their free time and it would benefit many people in the country that are in need of special services. The principal could also include incentives or punishments to motivate the students in doing the community service. Lastly, i feel, deep inside my heart, i feel that there are kids out there that desperately need to help kids instead of doing what they do. In other words, if the country needs helpers to assist in helping the environment and the citizens, then the principal should most likely make the students be active in their communities."
9166,0,"First, the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because Venus is the second planet from the sun. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. Venus can have a lot of dangers, since it's closer to the sun and the sun is really hot all 365 days a year. Venus is never going to be like Earth, it has all four types of weather all year around and Venus has only dangerous weathers all year around. Secondly, a piece of evidence that supports my claim is in paragraph 3 it says, "" A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. "" That piece of evidence shows that Venus has a lot of chemicals in their air pollution and that's why barely any people go visit the planet. Next, another piece of evidence that supports my claim is in paragraph 3 it says, "" On the planet's surface, temperature average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. "" That piece of evidence shows that Venus is a very hot planet since it close to the sun too, that means of one day you would go to Venus you would have to drink a lot of water to stay hydrated. Lastly, a piece of evidence that supports my claim in paragraph 3 it says, "" Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments liking erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface. "" That piece of evidence shows that Venus can have any type of weather every sinlge day that is different acorrding to the temperature. In conclusion, that's why I think the author suggests that studying Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The conditions in Venus are too extreme for humans to handle. People that would go to Venus probably would only last maybe a day. The next day they would want to go back to Earth and never come back to Venus again."
19107,0,"Dear Senator of Florida, I strongly believe that we have to change the way we vote because the Electoral College is a horrible way to vote. It is not fair one bit and i think we should vote for the candidates that deserve to truely win. Not have it where we vote for someone but we actually are just voting for a slate of 34 electors who are pledged to the runner. Electoral college has so many disagreements, but then it has agreements. This way of voting avoids run-off elections because if two candidates had the same amount of popular votes then they look at the electoral votes and it helps them know who is the winner. In large states they try to do electoral votes becuase it gives the presidential candidates more attention in a campaign than smaller states do. Then we have the disagreements and they are pretty good logical points. When we use this system we dont vote for the president we are only voting for a slate of electors that elect for the president themselves. This just basically in my eyes looks like a cheat election and it shouldnt even count. Another thing is this method of selecting our president turns off potential voters for a candidate that has no intension of carrying for their state. Some people just vote to vote so they dont care of what might happen to their surroundings but then there are people that are voters and care and want to express a political preference other than the people that think a single vote will decide an election. ""Electoral Votes get overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner"". The electors are the ones that are voting not the people. This is all wrong i believe that we should vote for the president by popular vote. Its more fair and efficent. There wouldnt be anymore cheat elections. It would be the ""people voting finally""!"
12291,0,"Unmasking the Face The face on Mars was really not a face on mars. Some people say it is a face but I believe it is just a formation on the planet. They have taken 3 pictures and 2 of them prove it is a mesa on Mars. The proof of that is that they have taken pictures in 1998,2001, and have compared it to a landform in the USA. People who believe it is created by aliens suely hasn't seen all the evidence behind ""The Face."" First of all, when people saw the face in 1976 they couldnt have had o believe an aliens as making it. How could have there have been a person on Cydonia or an alien. That is why they went back to Mars to prove some scientists' theories wrong. On April 5, 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor had flew over Cydonia for the first time. The surveyor had a picture that was ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Some people were not satisfied because it was cloudy on the Red Planet. They said that the alien marking were hidden by blaze. Compaing the picture of 1998, it certailey looks more like a regular rock on a surface. They went back four years later on a less cloudy day to still prove the believers wrong. On a cloudless day the Mars Global Surveyor took away a piece of evidence of aliens in space. On April 8, 2001, four years later than the last visit to Cydonia, the surveyor captured the photo much better than all pictures and proved tha the face was a natural platform. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in he best 1976 Viking photo. The photos were astonishing and made the face be un masked. Jim Garvin, a chief scientist, said that ""It reminds me most pf Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the ame height as the Face on Mars."" They are comaparing it to landforms on Earth! How much more evidence can you ask for. The face on mars has been a fraud for being an alien landform. All the evidenc shos all the people and my friend that the ""Face"" is not real and just a landform accordin to a ver clear picture and an explanation from Jim Garvin."
20522,0,". Senator i believe the electoral college should be consider changed by congress because of the many people in this great country wouldnt trust electors for voting. I think every single confirmed vote should be counted and registered because that is the true meaning of voting for something or someone.Out of the 538 elector it would be a lie not to think one of them had a favorite or been bribed or rigged elections i think its hard to trust a bunch of men and women who a majority of the states no nothing about. Ialso think swing states should be considered like every other state there is instead of calling them ""toss-up states"" that anyone could over take. Even as the text says Who are the electors, they can someone not holding a public State office, who picks them, and we cant even vote on who the electors should be. The system is a disaster in it's self why are we taking a million public citizen votes and only letting one man or women ""Turn it in"" its non-democratic and it has no real use this off i completely disagree and do not feel that the electoral college is needed it seems like a waste of our U.S money and puts us in debt by paying these 538 people Tons of cash to vote on something a simple as Voting. now there is only one thing i believe is right in the voting system is that big state (size and population) does deserve the bigger ammount of electoral votes then smaller states like Florida, New York,California,Texas and many other states Since the population is so dense By changing the voting system to popular vote i think makes people feel more involved in whats actually happening instead of just one measly vote. people complain about other people who dont vote well thats one of the reasons why 1 person out of a 4.5 million population state no one would care cause then those go right to the electoral college then thats what actually matters so at the end of the day people could careless who ran the nation. But at the end of the night anyone who knows about the electoral college wants it to be changed"

The author uses facts and information to back this idea up. The author has facts on poor conditions on Venus then gives us information and ideas on ways to overcome. The author is using a problem and solution method. The author supported the idea with facts and more ideas that would make it safer and beneficial to us if we travel to Venus for further examination. In the article the author talks about how Venus has really bad conditions, but they are all just challenges that can be overcome. These challenges are the main thing holding us back from exploring further. The author believes that our travels beyond Earth should'nt be limited by dangers and doubts. The article also talkes about how we need longer lasting technology for further research. It mentions mechanical computers and how they don't require electronics at all. The author suggests using the mechanical parts, like the ones used in the mechanical computers, and using them to create technology that will last longer on Venus. This would allow for more research. More research means better understanding of Venus which will allow for better technology to with stand the conditions. In the paragraph above the author gives us a problem on how our technology can't survive the conditions, because the systems get fried and break. Then the author gives us a possible solution to our problem. The author gives us a new idea for better technology. The author uses a problem and solution to support the idea. In conclusion, the author supported the idea well by using a problem and then giving a solution using facts and evidence.

People sometimes dont want to go to class and they don't want to learn. They can video call or do online classes to make sure they are OKAY, SAFE or hanging out with their family. Online work when they can't show up to school and if they are to busy they can do their work at home. Onine work is helpfull when they don't know what they are doing in class. People with family vacation, they are missing out of their school work, so when they are at their vacation they don't have to missed any work they can video call them and ask for help and they can recorded of what they are doing. With a family emergency they have to miss school but they can do their work after their family crisis like on a weekend. A family vacation is a long week, your friend can call or text you and let you know about the information of what they are doing in class. Something goes as adult they can work during the family vacation and after they are done they can go for their day. However if the family vacation is early they have to go but they have to do their work online in the car. People with injuries can be really bad, if they can't walk yet and have to use a wheelchair, but they have to stay home and they can do their work at home or a friend can go to their house and give them their homework or work they have to do in class. When they do their work at home they don't have to missed any work and they can bring up their grades and they don't have to fail the class. With sickness people can get really bad cold or the flu and it will take them a while to recover. They need to stay and extra day to recover. However, they can get their work done while they are recovering from their cold or the flu. People that are babysitting they can't go to school because the parent have to go to important meeting and he/she is sick or they are just babies, they have to babysitting while that parent is at work. Babysitting is a tough job but it is hard to get the work done. But if they have two older kids and just a baby they can turn watching the baby and they can do their work online while the teacher is recording the work. If they are doing the work online they can turn in homework that is already complete and their grade can go up and the next day they can go to school and turn in the work that is already complete. Therefore, when the older child is watching the kid and the kid is sleep they can do their finishing work. Some people think that they shouldn't do online classes or video conference because they think is a wast of time, but if they are injured or sick or they have to babysit they parent can't do everything at once, if the kid is injured they can do their work online and they don't have to miss any work from school. Samething with adult if they are sick they can stay home and do work from home, so they don't have to get the other people sick. With injuries with school and work if they break their leg or both of their legs they have to stay home until they are recover and they can do school work at home and adult can do their work. in conclusion it is better if they can do their work online with a family crisis is important."

24962,0,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. Today I will show you why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. The benefits from this are that you have many ideas,you will also be able to combine different ideas to make better ones, and how it can lead you to a better choice. When I want advice, I always want multiple decisions to choose from, because it will lead me to a better decision. First, asking multiple people for advice will give you many different ideas to choose from. For example, if I want to take a language next year, I will talk to my friends and family who took a language and what language they would prefer. Now I would have multiple ideas to choose from. Having multiple ideas is great because you can choose which one is best for you. Second, you could combine different ideas to make better ideas. For example, if I want to go fishing while my dad wants to go hunting we can fish while we hunt. next time if you and your friend both have different ideas combine them and you will get something great. having different ideas is good so you could invent something amazing. Last, why other peoples opinions will lead you to the best choice. For example, say that I asked somebody if they prefer a restaurant that I want to go to, and they say that I shouldn't go there. It could be a personal opinion or past experience. Listen to what others have to say and think if the decision is trustworthy. Next time when you are asking for advice remember to ask others, think of all the different ideas, combine different ideas to make better ones, and why the decision will lead to the best choice."
341,0,"Phones were created to alert people if a crisis were about to begin or to contact loved ones from far away for long periods. Over the years, phones have since upgraded into cell phones that can fit anywhere. They are very efficient and much lighter to carry around. Cell Phones nowadays help get minds off of certain things that disturb daily lives by entertaining the brain. Some people argue that cell phones help with safety issues but that's far from the truth because cell phones lead to serious accidents and communication problems on the road. Without a doubt, drivers should not be able to use their cell phones on the road because it causes a lack of focus and leads to serious accidents. This is a major issue since drivers are usually on their phones all the time. For example, ""the major drawback of using cell phones during driving is that it distracts the attention of the driver"" (Scotti, 2007). This leads to putting the passenger at risk of injury. Along the same lines, this can be very dangerous if the driver has earbuds in his or her ear. For instance, ""cell phones reduce the driver's performance""(Gravelle, 2005). The driver can be impaired and no longer able to hear what's going on, which can lead to confusion on the roads and cause the driver to make the wrong turn. Some may argue that texting while driving is dangerous and may lead to serious injuries but, that's the opposite. Texting has proven to be the quickest way of getting work finished without having to be in the office or the school building. It's a great help with accessing the shops online rather than using a map. For example, ""using FMs on cell phones can provide information about weather and traffic"" (Sturnguist, 2006). In the same way, this makes it easier to decide on what outfit to wear that day. Not only does it help with weather issues it can also help with navigating the quickest way from accidents. However, driving while having a cellphone in hand is still against the law, and can lead to suspension or worse jail time. People on the road believe that if they wear their seatbelt, it can protect them from accidents but this is only half correct. It provides the passenger with somewhat of a small chance of protection but a higher risk with or without it on. Studies have highlighted that ""drivers using cell phones react slowly and often make wrong decisions causing serious accidents involving other vehicles"" (Gravelle, 2005). This is the main reason why cell phones shouldn't be in your hands while driving. As an example, especially during bad weather or driving on slippery roads, drivers engage in conversation and pay less attention to these areas, increasing the risk of fatal accidents. (Gravelle, 2005) Along the same lines, people need to stop having cellphones in hand. It's going to cause suffering later. Drivers should not be able to use a cellphone while driving because it leads to serious accidents. These accidents could lead to paralyzation or death. The fact that people still do this is scary. It's highly dangerous and risky to be doing this at all. Hopefully, in the future, they will create some type of equipment to detect people with phones in hand, because if they don't more drivers and their passengers may face death and destruction."
10113,0,"Some people can tell wheather someone is happy or sad. They can observe what their emotions is. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", shows how Leonardo da Vinci drew Mona Lisa. It also explains how technology called the (Facial Action Coding System) can identify human emotions. Here's the question, is the new technology(Facial Action Coding System) worth using it? First of all, the new technology sounds cool and all that stuff, but how would this be used? Some advantages about the technology is that you can find out what the student's emotions are. For example, what if the student is not speaking when asked a question? That would be a good time to use the technology. Another advantage is to find out what a baby's emotion is, that way it'll be easier to take care of the baby. Disadvantages about the technology is when and where will this be the best time to use this technology in the outside world? Would this technology work best in public? Probably not in my opinion, because why would people used this out in public? True it may help when people are in danger, but not using the technology proper, yeah, that's just a waste of money. Another thing to mention is that this technology would only work in computers for right now. Students can detect other student's emotion with this technology. This would be a good use in group projects, but other than that it's basically useless. Not trying to be rude or anything, it's just that who has the time to use this technology? People are allow to use it but they'll probably not use it properly. In conclusion, I think that the new techology(Facial Action Coding System), is pretty useless. Who has the time to use this? When or where can this be used? I know it identifies human emotions, but i already can tell other people's emotions by the look of their faces. That's why I don't think that the use of this technology is actually not worth of using it."
21435,0,"Dear Principal, I think that Policy 1 would be a good decision for the school. In many cases students must use their phones for after-school activities and it might become a problem if the students do not have their phones with them at school. Most parents often feel safer when their children have their phones with them at school. So in my opinion, it should be the parents decision if they want to allow their child to bring their phone to school or not. A big deal for teachers is that the students are paying attention to their phones and not the lesson in class. With this policy it would allow the students to be able to socialize without doing it in class and disturbing others. This policy states that they would only be allowed phone use during free times and then turned off during class, so the teachers should not mind this situation. Another thing is safety. In the case of an emergency these students would be able to help contact emergency services or simply call their parents to inform them that something has gone wrong. If you decide to go with Policy 2 these students would not be able to contact their parents at all until they get back to their phone. This could cause many problems for many people. It seems like everyone uses a phone, may that be texting or calling or getting information. Policy 1 would let students be able to do these things at school during appropriate times. In my view point, there is not anything that would seem to go wrong in this situation. I have heard of other schools having this routine before so I do not see why it would not work for this school as well. I think, personally, that Policy 1 would be a good choice to have at this campus. Teachers would not mind, parents would feel safer and the students at this school would enjoy this privilege. Please consider my opinion in your decision. Sincerely, Student"
6274,0,"many students dont have valuable life skills that can help them succeed in life. without these valuable life skills, students cant do things to their full potential and it can lead to failure. the principle should make it mandatory for all students to participate in a extracurricular activity. it can help teach students things like time management, teamwork and a strong work ethic. time management is one of the most helpful skills you can learn from doing extracurricular activities. sometimes you will have to go to events or things that will take up a large amount of time. that dose not mean you get a ""get out of jail free card"" for homework and chores at home, you have to manage your time wisely to fit in time to do work. if you can manage your time well, work will feel less and less overwhelming and can be finished in a fraction of the time it takes you to finish it normally. without overwhelming work, students will feel less stress and have a better time going through the day. finally, good time management can free up extra time in the day. with extra time, students can relax or do more work. overall, time management is a extremely valuable skill you can learn from doing extracurricular activities. another important skill that can be learned from extracurricular activities is teamwork. teamwork is a skill that can be used almost every day in almost every task you can think of. for example, if you are in a soccer team, you will need to coordinate how to play with your team members to win the game. another way teamwork is used is in school, you can evenly distribute work between your group members in a project and work together to make a strong and effective final product. last but not least, teamwork can assist you in getting a job, many workplaces are looking for people that can work effectively in a team. team work is a very useful skill that can be applied to almost every task at hand. lastly a good work ethic can be achieved by participating in extracurricular activities. these activities can have extra work to do at home, like forms or worksheets. this might feel overwhelming at first but if you have a good work ethic, you can finish all your homework and work from extracurricular activities in no time. a good work ethic can help you feel comfortable with your work load even if it looks like a lot to do. you can also accomplish more work in less time if you have a strong work ethic, making it easier to finish school and go to collage. in conclusion, having a good work ethic can make your life run Smith and easy. many students lack valuable life skills that can make their life more enjoyable. some of these life skills like time management, teamwork, and a good work ethic are a necessity to be successful and can be gained by doing extracurricular activities. overall, doing extracurricular activities can improve your life drastically."
14343,0,"Dear Mr. Principal, It has come to my attention that you are considering making mandatory community service hours. I can see that the decision you are faced with is a difficult one. I do not believe that community service should be mandatory. I know, Mr. Principal, that you are probably judging me as a lazy teenager who doesn't care about his community, but I am prepared with several points to back up my opinion. First of all I would like to say that I believe that community service is very important. I think that everyone can help out here and there. But also believe that it should be done for the right reason. If you change you Modus Operandae from forcing students to do community service to encouraging them to do it than they it will increase the possibility for them to carry there good habits far beyond the limit that the school would set. Another reason why community service should be encouraged rather than enforced is that man students involved with sports and other extra-curricular activities simply don't have time in the day for it during the week. Many students are preparing college and writing essays and other preparation classes after school. Won't they be more productive members of society with a good education? I hope you will consider my opinions despite my young age. I trust that you will make the right decision and I will see the error of my thinking or that my judgment is slurred. Thank you for listening, STUDENT_NAME"
3695,0,"I think that the projects should be student-designed because when they choose a project they would already know what to do, they wouldn't make it hard, and they can do it on their own time. I think when the kids get to chose there own projects they would have to think about what their going to do. Some kids would already know what they want to do and go ahead and start it. Some of them will have to think for a little bit to figure out what their going to do. Some of the kids would probably not even do it at all because their to lazy. Most of the kids would probably finish it early so they wont have to worry about it later. When kids do projects that the teachers gives them most of the time their hard to do and hard to understand. So when the kids get to choose they wont make it that hard and they would make it to where they can understand it. They would make it to where they can actually do it and get it done before the due date. If the kids get to choose what they want to do for the project then they probably would want to do it. The kids could finish the project if they already know what their going to do for it. If the kids choose what to do for the project then they would be able to do it whenever they have time as long as its before the due date. If the kids are busy then they wont be able to do the project until they get done doing what their doing. As long as they do the project before the due date then they will fine and they wont get in trouble. If they get to do it whenever they want to they will be able to go out and do what they want before they have to finish and turn the project in. Most kids will probably forget that they have to do a project and have to do it at the last minute and it wont be as good. In conlusion, I think that the students should choose what they want to do for the projects instead of having the teachers choose because if the students pick they would already know what to do and go ahead and start it, they wouldnt make it hard, and they can also do it on their own time."
20392,0,"Though I have not been alive to see most of it, I am sure that the debate on keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote has been going on for ages. Now, the words of a fourteen year old might not mean much to a state senator, especially since it will be four years until I am legally allowed to vote, but please sir, hear me out. I believe that we should keep the Electoral College for many reasons. One, if the president was decided by popular vote, our president might not be the best one for the country. Secondly, if it were up to a popular vote, the president might win, or not win, simply for being a regional favorite. To start this off, if our president was decided by a popular vote, our president might not be the best thing for our country. As stated in the third article, paragraph 20, ""The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates... to focus their campaign effors on the toss-up states."" As you know, toss-up state's make the final vote. Therefore, people in these states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, and they will be the ones with the most information. If it were up to popular vote, then anyone over the age of 18 could randomly pick a winner. Let's be honest, the majority of eighteen year old's will vote on whoever their friends or family vote for, or even the candidate representing their group (Democratic or Republic). Many people, if the president was decided by popular vote, would make an uneducated decision on one of the canidates, not studying their choices as much as one would with the Electoral College system in place. Secondly, if it were up to a popular vote, the president might simply win because he (or she) is a regional favorite. As stated in the third article, paragraph 19, ""...because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president."" Also in the paragraph, it states that no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. If the president was decided by popular vote, however, can you imagine what it would be like? Take Romney, for example. He was a solid regional favorite in the South. Romney knew that there was no incentive to campaign heavily in the South, because he would not gain any electoral votes by increasing his plurilaty in states he knew he would win. If popularity decided the president, residents of the other regions might feel like their vote would not count, and that the president would have no regard for their interests. Say that popularity did actually determine a winner. While most regions might vote for a certain presidents, the ones that did not would feel like that the man running the country wasnt really ""their president"". However, Mr. Senator, if the Electoral College was to stay, this problem would never exist. With the system we have now, the people vote for your state's electors when they vote for the president. Most states also have a ""winner-take-all"" system. Therefore, the canidate with the most votes in a state win's that state's electors. This lets the voting be even, fair. A popular vote would make the voting unfair to those who did not want that president. Now, of course, the other view has to be adressed. As stated in the second article, ""Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning... During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all."" This quote shows that the canidates might not go to a state they know they have no chance in winning. I can see how this could support changing to election by popular vote, and how it could be reasonable. If our president was chosen by popular vote, then he would visit all of the states, trying to win them over. However, there are some strong arguments against this. To begin with, one man would have to visit 50 states, and even if he only visited the majority, there is still a posibility that the state will not vote for him anyways, in the end. If we keep the Electoral College, then the majority of votes in a state would count, not his popularity. As a fourteen year old, I can relate this to highschool. A student can be the most popular student in the school, but they can also be the most rude and mean. And while another student may not be popular, they can be the nicest in the school. If the president was chosen by a popular vote, he might just end up being the worst thing that could happen to the country. In conclusion, Mr. State Senator, I think that keeping the Electoral College is the best thing for our country. If we changed to election by popular vote, the man (or woman) might not be the best for our country, and the best man might not win because he is not a regional favorite. I hope, sir, that you will take my letter into account when you go to vote on this topic."
74,0,"Phones and Driving Essay All around the world people are constantly trying to decrease safety risks. Driving has become one of those risks to safety. Since cellular phones have grown to be popular. People often use them everywhere and in their car is no exception. At first this was great. You could be on a work call while you were on your way home. Or you could be checking to see if anyone else wanted food where you were eating at. Although this has brought much convenience, utility and entertainment. It also has brought great risk to safety while driving. Drivers become distracted and make more mistakes than usual. Causing more accidents. There is a big discussion over whether you should be able to use your phone while driving or not. I believe that phones should not be allowed to be used in cars. One reason that cell phones shouldn't be allowed is simply because you can last the car ride without using it. With the exception of an emergency of course. If something is important than you can pull over and make a call while getting gas or something. And everyone would be better off paying less car insurance. Also, if you have kids and display that you don't value safety, then they may follow and do the same and even worse. Another reason is that it puts everyone at risk including themselves. If everyone was on their phone while driving. We would probably have close to double the amount of accidents. Just for a little convenience. Studies show that texting and driving is more debilitating to your reaction time than driving while under the influence of alcohol. Humans are smaller and less noticeable than vehicles, making the likelihood of seeing a pedestrian much less than that of a car. And hitting a ton car is different than hitting a pedestrian. The pedestrian would likely die if you were going fast enough. In conclusion, simply because the downsides outweigh the upsides. You should not be able to go on your phone while driving. Because of the distraction that it causes. ANd its impact on our awareness of our surroundings while driving. It's a safety risk and for the most part only has downsides. From hitting cars to hitting pedestrians, the risk is not worth it as it puts many lives at risk."
23175,0,"i thnk is a good idea to attend classes from home online. Some of the reasons that students would benefits from this idea are that students will not have no excuces for not turning in work, projects, etc because there were not able to go to school. Another reason is that teachers dont have to be worry if that student is distracting other students from the class, some some of the estudents things that schoolis nit for them but if they could be at home and attending to school online less student would drop out of school each year. Other reason is that there are many students that gets bullying from other students, and most of the stuents that get bully decide to drop out of school because they do not feel confortable with it. Each year many students gets bullying by other students and some of the teches do not do anything about it so many of the students decide to not to go to school but if school has the program to attendt to school online the student will mot have to drop out of schoolthey can just stay at home and still get class with out any other student bothering or bullying othe other students. however if schools opends the online classes most of the student will not go to school because it will be easier for them to stay at home and do not have to wake up too early to go to the buss stop and decide what outfit are they wearig so i think that schools should openeds online clasess just for students that really needs it"
20270,0,"Dear Florida State Senator With all do respect i dont think having the electoral college is a proper way to nominate a president, or any senate for our country. i strongly agree that we should have the idea of changing it to election by popularity. to be known as a good person or a good citizen in your state or anywhere you have to be a great rolemodel & an excellent example to our world. From what i discovered in a passage electoral college is unfair. who are the electors? and who picks out the electors? it dependes on the state. voters sometimes vote for there electores but sometimes the voters get confused on who they voted on. somtimes the wrong candiate. yes i do think that people who are running for president and senate should have the right to have a chance to become something big, but in my perspective i think that peoiple who is known and well common to there state will be a better outcome to whatever they run for. its like for an example, we live in the Florida state, we've know a woderful and handsome man that helps around our state and town of plant city, giving us more and devoring most of his time helping the enviroment and creating a diffrence. The man would have a greater chance of being nomitanted to being a president unlike the other man who only came out of his shell a year ago and have no idea what this man is capable of. Who will we have better trust on? When you win a contest or a bet we usally get what we accomplished for, when a elector wins, it takes all. well only the electoral collge works up on this. so please state senator, please change the process on how we are voting now, i think it would be alot more acceptable to vote on a preident on popularity. The united sates wants to be in the hands of a trusted person and someone the whole world can look upond."
4821,0,"Summer vacations is a blessing and a curse. It provides approximately three months of free time for students, while also providing three months worth of opportunities for students to forget all they had learned in the last school year. To combat this, there are summer activities designed to keep the academic engine running in preparation for the upcoming school year. A student-designed summer project is a motivating drive for students, is personalized by the students, and encourages responsibility and accountability. Motivation is the driving force of all work. Tasks are more difficult to complete, or even start, without a reason for performing such a thing. A student-designed summer project, in name itself, can be quite the motivator amidst the lax summer vacation. It incentivises participation by having the student choose how they wish to execute their task. It also incentivises completion in a similar matter, with a mindset along the lines of ""it will be easier to finish this on my own terms"". The average student is very fickle with their preferences after all. Beyond their own self-drive, a spark of creativity is encouraged as well. Nothing is more satisfying than your own work. Just simply having a finished product to call your own, a product crafted by you alone, is incredibly satisfying. A student-designed summer project is customized by the student and for the student. This allows personalization that acknowledges a student's strengths and weaknesses, such as time management or particular skills. It provides personal input that encourages students to speak for themselves while still abiding by the guidelines. However, a personal voice is not the only useful skill they can practice. Later in the school life, and, eventually, even beyond, students must hold themselves accountable. For example, if their score on a test seemed incorrect, the students are responsible for double checking with their teacher. They can practice these habits with a personalized summer project. The students are responsible for their choices and actions. If they want to try something new, they can try it, as long as they are held accountable for it. If they make a mistake, it is okay, as long as they take responsibility for what they have done. However, their is still difficulty in trusting students. Whether from elementary school, middle school, or high school, students are not always trustworthy. There are many who learn to work around restrictive school systems, or formulate lies to get past skipping classes or cheating. Just allowing a student to craft their own method of studying and practicing is just begging for trouble. It is possible that students can be lazy and procrastinate. They might even take the easy way out by putting in minimal effort. It is true that such freedom can be troublesome. However, that is only one side of the coin. There are students who are trustworthy, or more willing to work and improve. It is worth the shot to let these young minds practice helpful skills and maintain a studious mind. A personalized summer project crafted by students provides motivation to work and encourages the practice of responsibility. To improve, one must understand their strengths and weaknesses. To perform, one must have a reason to do so. Even if students are as fickle as they are, they still deserve a chance to create their own method of studying and practice. A summer vacation is a chance to relax, but it should not be a time to forget."

For example, lets say two people are running too be president of the United States. People vote and everything but then its up too the 538 electors. Then the 538 electors choose who they want as their president, 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President, as weeks go by, the new President is one of the two people that ran too be President was elected.

24746,0,"Making choices can be hard. Whether you don't know what decision to choose from, or you're stuck on a couple of options, asking other people their opinions can be vital to making that decision. Seeking multiple opinions from others can help someone make a better choice because it lets them see from a new perspective, they can learn more about their choices, and asking for multiple opinions can help give you more ideas than just asking one person. To start off, asking others for their opinion can help someone see from a new perspective. If you're writing a paper, or making a play, asking others for advice and opinions can help appeal to the larger public, and make you seem less bias. Looking from a new perspective can let you see how you sound to your audience. If you're making something like a big business decision, simply asking others for their view can help you imagine how you would impact others. It can also shine some light on downsides you never noticed, so you can learn to avoid those kinds of decisions in the future. Furthermore, listening to other people's opinions can help someone learn more about their decision. What I mean by this is, for example, if you wanted to try skydiving for once, you could ask people who have already done it what they think about it. It can help you look at the bigger picture. Asking other people with background experience can help inform you about your decision. Asking people for sources is important too. These sources can help, in a paper, make someone's writing more credible. If someone's making a hard decision, they can check the source and list pros and cons about a decision they aren't exactly sure about yet. Finally, asking multiple people for their opinions can help spark more ideas. For example, if a family was going on a trip, taking in other people's ideas could help decide where to go, and it can make other people happy with the final decision. Taking a moment to listen to someone's ideas can also narrow down your options. If a college student is having trouble finding a subject they want to major in, they can ask people for ideas, which can inspire them to pursue something they are interested in. Asking other people for insights is better than asking one person. If you're ever feeling lost, asking others can help you whittle down to a few options. Today's society is one where you can't get anywhere without talking to other people. Humans are social animals, and they can't live without other humans. Making hard decisions is all part of life, and getting through them helps shape who you are. Asking other people to help make a decision is a healthy choice. It can help you see the bigger picture, look at more options-- asking others can help you learn more about certain options, or see how they affect other people. Asking other people for insight is important and it can help make the right choice."

So nervous but so anxious, filled with fear that you can't help but to embrace. Boy what a rush, but what about those who haven't had that experience yet? I guess that's one thing we forgot to stop and think about hmm.. That's because when it's outside of ourselves it doesn't really faze us. Sure taxi rides are fine at times but it would get old and boring sooner or later with out a doubt. So driverless cars are not really what I think we need at this point. Driverless cars seems like a fun futuristic type of thing so I understand why people would want them, not to mention that in certain situtation could be lovely to have. Why wouldn't you want a driverless car you may ask. Well First off the price of one of these machines cost up to two hundred million dollars and I know for a fact I can't afford this and neither can lots of others in this world.There is also things that just don't add up, we have been told nothing about warrinties or how any payment go, do you get the same insurance as you did with a regular vechicle, and if something breaks or goes wrong and your injuired or injure someone else who's to blame. The text even ask it's self "" If the technology fails and someone is injuired' who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?"". If that's not a clear cut reason of why these are nothing but a risk then I don't know what is. People can be put at fault for an accident that they had no control over at all because the car drives its self, therefore its like a game of Russina roulette you never know whats gonna happen or who will be blamed. In conclusion to some of these terrible possiblitles I still take into consideration that everything right now is just he said she said no one really has proof that it will shut down and cause accidents or if it will even cost two hundred million by the time it comes out. But there are some things we do know and that is that in: California, Nevada, Florida, and District of Columbia it is illegal to have even semi-automatic cars and changing laws for something unproven is highly doubted. As of now it sounds safer for a driver to be paying full attention to the road then to be in a unpredictable driverless car where anything could happen, safety comes first. So for the sake of the people who haven't had a chance to experience their first time behind the wheel and for the safety of all on the road driverless cars are a no in my book."
10548,0,"In the article ""Making Mona Lise Smile,"" the author describes a wonderful technological advancement called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). This technology allows for computers to analyze a human face and determine the emotion, or emotions, that person is feeling. With the help of this new software, Professor Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at tge University of Illionois, and Professor Nicu Sebe, of the University of Amsterdam, were able to determine that the Mona Lisa is 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry. This outstanding innovation can be very beneficial to society. They have created something that can not only help us have a better understanding of the body, but can also change the way we communicate in drastic ways. With FACS we, as people, will be able to better understand the anatomy behind joy, depression, anger, all of it! We will have access to parts of the brain that millions of scientists have never understood. FACS creates oprotunity for discovery far beyond what we already know. For centuries scientists have been asking, ""What makes a happy person happy?"" and ""What is causing all these mood swings?"" With these advancements applied, we can know when a change in mood happens and use brain scans to figure out where and why this is happening. ""Communication is key!"" That's something we all hear all of the time but no one seems to be any good at. The suicide rate is out of control and the divorce rate is crazy high. Using FACS we can deminish these numbers! A simple understanding of the emotions another human is displaying can change, and save, lives. If we have the technology to understand what a person is feeling, then we can fix things before they completly fall apart. We can offer solutions to the problems that people are facing everyday simply by understanding how they feel and what is causing their hurt. This technology could be the difference between wether or not your parents stay together or your friend jumps off a bridge. That is why I believe this technology should be immediately incooperated into society. It can save lives, it can save love. FACS is an important technology that needs to be applied to everyday life as soon as possible. Not only will it change the world for the better but it will be the difference between life and death."
12720,0,"If you think the Face on Mars was created by aliens, you're out of your mind. Aliens didn't create the Face, it's just a huge rock formation. In fact, the Face is just a natural landform. The Face was photographed with a high quality camera that could make images 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So if there were other objects created by aliens, you'd be able to see them. If the Face was really created by aliens, there should be more objects to prove that, and not just the Face. The picture of the Face is very similar to the Middle Butte located in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Garvin says it's about the same height as the Face on Mars, which shows that the Face is a natural landform like the Middle Butte. When the picture of the Face was posted on a JPL web site, it revealed a natural landform. Many people believed there was no alien monument after all. So in conclusion, there are many reasons why the Face is a natural landform. The theory of the Face being created by aliens is inaccurate."
14924,0,"Dear, Principal I have been hearing about all this commotion with this community service stuff. I feel like i should have my say in this part so i' m going to tell you what i think about the community service. I think we should have students take part in community service. The first reason i think we should participate in community service is that it sets a good example for people. By doing this i feel like we could persuade other schools to take part in this experience. And possibly make this a worldwide thing to do in this country. That's my first reason why i think we should take part in community service. Responsibility. That is what this would teach us students. It would help them understand the work world. Also how to care for others or helping around the town with certain things. That is what this community service thing would do for us. My last reason i think we should do this is this would be an on going thing in the school. It would keep going on 20 years later 30 years 50 years 100 hundred years. It would be an on going thing which would be setting examples and helping out around the town for years to come. I would teach our kids to do this and our kids kids to do the right thing and participate in this community service project. That is my last reason for this. I hope i have persuaded you enough to take action in this. Cause responsibility is a big part of peoples lives and i think this would be just the right thing to do for us children. So i support taking part in community service. Sincerely your student, STUDENT_NAME"
23166,0,"Beep. Beep. Beep. Oh no that's your alarm clock. You have 20 minutes to rush and get ready for school before you miss the bus, again. You can't afford to miss the bus because your mom already left. As you hurry out the door you remember you didn't eat breakfast. ""Oh well"" you think, you rarely eat breakfast anyways. Once you get to school, loud noises and stress about your English project fill your head. As you go throughout the day, all you think about is that glorious bell that rings at 2:10 on the dot to save you. Then you'll finally be able to go home, just to do this all over again the next day. Public school has created an environment filled with bullying, stress, and does not benefit students who face learning or mental disabilities, but online school could be a solution to these issues. Every student who has been in a public school has had the thought, ""What if they don't like me?"". Bullying and discrimination have become so normalized in the school system all across the country, to the point where students feel there is no one to go to. Everyone must fit into a certain standard, or else they are considered ""weird"" or get left out. If you don't have the latest shoes or wear your hair a certain way, then chances are, it's going to be hard to immediately fit in. We were taught as kids that it's OK to be different, but is it really? If you dont find a clique to fit in with, no one will take you in. School has become less and less about learning, and more about the ability to make people like you. You can see it as soon as you walk into a public school. Girls wearing clothes they hate, but do it because if they don't, they won't have friends, and boys playing sports that they don't even like, all so they'll fit into a group. The need to feel liked by your peers has taken a large toll on student's mental health. Many students dread going to school due to the hate as soon as they walk into the building. With online school, students will never have to fear hate from their peers again, and be able to be at peace with what they choice to wear and do. Did you the math homework? Oh and the history project? What about the 5 page English essay? The science lab, did you finish it? An average high school student takes 7 classes, with only about an hour a day for that class. So to fit in the information not covered in class, teachers will assign homework every night. Every teacher will tell you homework shouldn't take more than an hour. Now multiply that hour by your other seven classes. Students already wake up at early hours every weekday just to go to sleep at late hours due to homework. With online classes, these unfair hours won't affect students. The option of waking up later and being able to spread out your classes will help student's stress levels tremendously. There will be no more rushing to do your homework on the bus or not wanting to go to school because you and your teacher don't get along. With less stress on students backs, grades could possibly be affected positively and students will feel happier about the idea of school. Public school was built on an idea that every student is perfect, but that is in fact not the case. Not every student has the mental or physical capability of sitting in a brightly lit classroom for an hour at a time, listening to a teacher drone on and on about a subject that does not interest them. Not every special needs student is properly diagnosed, so they're seen to be ""dumb"" by their teachers and peers. Students with things such as ADHD are not benefited with how the school system is currently setup. Their brain structure just does not allow them to sit and focus for an hour at a time, seven times a day. Many students are athletes, and with athletics come concussions. Many concussed students are told by medical professionals to not go to school, yet they still have to, because if they don't, they fail. There are so many setbacks for many students in the current public school system, that online school should be an easier option for them. Students with learning disabilities will have a better opportunity to pass, without fearing judgment from others. Students with focusing problems can now space out their classes and be able to move around as they learn. Students with medical issues can learn from the comfort of their own home and do as the doctor informed them to. Online school can create countless opportunities for students who need them most. Bullying and stress in public schools can finally be ended, along with giving students with learning disabilities new advantages. Online school can now reach out to students who were feeling as if there was no hope left. It can hopefully improve grades, and increase graduation rates. There will be many more students wanting to go to college and create new jobs and career options. Online school can make a great impact on our future."
13364,0,"Hi, my name is Decaon. And I work for NASA. I am here to discuss the face on mars. Many people think that it was created by aliens. But I am here to explain why it wasn't created by aliens. The first photo was taken in 1976 by the Viking 1 Spacecraft. The craft was circleing Mars trying to find a spot for its sister ship to land. The Viking 2 Spacecraft. The first reason to why people think it is alien. Is the quality of the pictures that were taken. The first picture was taken in 1976 so the resolution of the picture wasnt very good. Which caused it to look like there was a nose, eyes and a mouth. But pictures that were taken years after show that it could have been the quality. There is another reasonable explanation. During july 1976 it would have been winter on mars at the time. So that means the storms on mars could have casted a shadow. But many still believe that it is alien. Even though this some of the best evidence to peove the face on mars isnt alien but a mistake. But the most compelling reason is. It is simialr to some of the rock formations that we have on Earth. Scientist have found that in the western United States there are rock formations that are very similar. They are simailasr to the snake river palin in Idaho. After a lengthy expalnation. I hoope i have provided enough facts to prove to you that. The face on Mars was not created by aliens. but created by an optical illusion. That are found on Earth as well as On Mars. And i hope This has been very informative for you."

If we are far away from each other or to speak with parents at school incase we need to tell them something important, like if I had a test coming up or something was on the counter and I needed mom or dad to grab it for me, or if I left something for them at the house and they did not notice it yet. I believe we should be able to use are cell phones in school lunch period but turn it off after lunch so we are not able to text are friends who are in class and do not disturb there work in progress. These are some reasons why I think we should be able to use phones at lunch, There for I will go with policy 1. Other times during school we should also be able to use cell phones for that time but when the free time is over then we will turn are cell phones off and go on with are normal day. I hope that you agree with the terms listed. By STUDENT_NAME."
10997,0,"Imagine a classroom specifically tailored to each individual student and their emotion. The students there enjoy coming to school. If they are bored, the lesson changes to regain their interest. If they are confused, the lesson uses a different method of explaining to help them better understand what is being taught. The article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" describes a new emotion-recognition software that could do just that. The use of technology to read emotion is valuable and should be used classrooms. The technology that is used currently in schools could be bettered using this new software. Throughout the United States, many schools are looking for solutions to better their classrooms. Emotion-recognition could be the answer. Most schools already have devices in place such as lap-tops, iPads, and classroom computers. With technology already in schools, why not strive to make it better? The only step that would need to be taken is putting these softwares in place. Students could have more enjoyment and better understanding in schools with emotion detecting softwares. Those who find it hard to pay attention could recieve lessons that are constantly changing. Students that are having a difficult time with a particular portion or subject could recieve help. Even those who are commonly bored in school could be given more challanging lessons to keep their interest up, simply through emotion-recognition. With happier kids and more personalized instruction, student's success in school could increase. If children had a more positive experience in school, they could enjoy learning more. If students enjoyed learning more, they might have more motivation to do well in school. Also, each individual student would be given instruction tailored to them, so no student would be left behind or have less oportunity to succeed than others. Overall, the use of emotion detecting technology is valuable and should be used in classrooms. Technology is already being used in schools, so all that would have to be done is putting the new software in place. Increases in student enjoyment while at school could greatly effect the levels of student success, leading to a smarter generation of motivated and positive individuals. If a change that is not difficult to make, could have such a great impact, why is it not in place already?"
18246,0,"Driverless cars are in theory is a good idea, but when put to the test with real humans inside of them they are far too dangerours and not practical. With no one driving the car, only relying on senors, there is way too many possiblities to injury wether it is the riders or pedestrians. The smart cars would be too expensive for the average american and just not realistic. In the article, Driverless Cars Are Coming it states that ""Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009"" What are the specific conditions? Certainly not in a hard rain or heavy snowfall. In real life situations no one watching the road is a huge risk, anything could happen that a senor could not detect. People should not trust a senor to carry their family to their destination, wether it is ten mintues away or an hour. Who would be at fault if in an accident a driverless car hit another cart that did have a driver in it? With a driverless car the driver would get bored, doze off or spend time on his/her cell phone. With a distracted driver the likelihood of an accident increases dramaticly. The driver presuming that no accidetns will occur would look away from the road, but when a car B pulls out unexpectidly infront of it whose fault would it be? The manufacturer? The driver in the driverless car? Or the driver in car B? Puting ones' self or ones' family in that kinda of danger is really testing their luck. Smart cars that can drive themselves would be extremly expensive. Brands like Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan are already in the hundrend-thousand dollar range. A car like is is not practical to the everyday person. Those who ride in driverless car are put in more danger than those who ride along with a driver. Driverless cars are likely to cause more accident, especially because the car is not seeing what is going on infront of it. The car will not be able to notice black ice, a heavily trafficed area, road construction or know exactly when to use the brake if an accident were to occur infront of it. These types of cars are way too expensive, not realistic and not as safe as they seem to be."
5343,0,"The program called Seagoing Cowboys will allow you to experience adventure and vist many unique places. The reason I think this is because he gets to deal with horses every day, which I would love to do that, and when he stops he gets to travel around the cities. Luke says he gets to care for the animals while he´s crossing oceans. They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalles had to be cleand too. He says he got the benefit of seeing Europe and China. ¨But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special,¨ he says. ¨So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.¨ Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. This proves to me that the Seagoing Cowboys program trip would be fun. Please consiter this idea."
21394,0,"Dear TEACHER_NAME, I have recently heard that you are debating if students bring their phones to school or not. Honestly, my say might not do you any good. But, I feel that it is a great idea. On the other hand, students that do not bring their phones to school might be an issue. How so? you might ask. In these next few paragraphs, I will explain my doing and hopefully you will see to taking in my opinion and proposition. Allowing students to bring their phones to school, and to use them during free time, is a wonderful idea. Also, keeping them off during class time is a good deal to at least being able to have the phones in the students' possession. It would be easier if teachers could see students on their phones and not take them away. We the students would not have to sneak the phones around school, and get later caught. The only minor problem is that students might not turn them off during class, disregarding your trust and rules. Otherwise, It is a good idea. What if something were to happen to that particular student? What if it was a personal problem and they could not come to a teacher? Reasons for having phones during school can go on for quite some time, but to keep it short and simple, It would be a great idea to have them during school. But why keep the phones away from the students? Why can we not have the phones? Why take them away? Students need phones as if they need oxygen to breathe. It is legit that even if you banned phones from school property, students would still bring and use them anyway. There is honestly no point. Sometimes they do go off during class, but it is not on purpose. I do understand the statement that phones are in fact distracting to the students and classmates. If you banned them, students would not be distracted, or taking the risk of exposure to the phones, causing them to be possessed by teachers and administrators. What's my opinion? In my personal belief, I feel that we should be able to have our phones. It is a legitimate trade for keeping and using the phones during free time and lunch, and keeping them off during the time of class and learning. If you allow this, students would be grateful and pleased, as well as the teachers and other workers at this school. Thank you for taking the time to examine my opinion and personal distress. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME"
23209,0,"To Begin with, many student have many excuses to not attend school. Of curse, that we can change this to not be happen anymore. Student may not complete the school if they lose the year. What would happen if student get affected for all student that not attend school? For example, like I seen in me that I have a lot of appointment that is affecting me and my grade. We can not let this happen we need to do many thing in order to not let our child lose. In addition, principal should offer distance learning for student that the way could not affect them because student might have a natural disaster in their neighborhood, student might be sick in such manner that could not attend school, that might affect their grade and they might repeat the year. First reason, student might be absent for a reason like to be sick in such manner that could not attend school. All included student that is special that they go for a week or more in the hospital. Moreover, student sometime the doctor let a lot of appointment for them to check up or appointment with the dentist. Also, student who have allergies when the weather change they got affect in that they may not come to school. In high school, student sometime they get pregnant and the doctor let them many appointment including when they delivery they lose many school days and that affect many student lose the year or they may get affect their grade. Because we don't know in the future what will happen to some of our student that many of them don't find any solution of their problem. In fact, we don't know what it will happen if we don't give an opportunity to our students. We must pay attention to them if they lose many days of school sometime they are afraid to talk about their problem. Second reason, student in their neighborhood might have a natural disaster also might need the distance learning in order to not lose school days. Sometime the weather get so angry that may bring accident or can bring tree crashing in our hose or may get rain and rain that could bring floating that may cause a lot of problem to some our students. In addition, the school bus may not get as in order to come to school. If it a student that walk that student could not get to school and the County could not cancel the school or even in there's no light and that may tell an announcement that student could not get informed about the school information weather. Because, if student get that problem the principal could not believe and it can not give an chance to those student to take the test or the exam that they had in class. After all, in the school no one care about you even if you have a teacher that it is so inpatient. To end with, the school should offer the distance learning to some of our students. Student may got sick for a little reason and if they had natural disaster, we should care about it. If we find a student that always is absent we should ask them what is the matter or what is the problem with them? While some may argue that if we offer the distance learning student may not lose school days and even they could not lose their grade student could have benefit from this way student could not lose, however some may argue that if we gave the distance learning to student student could not enjoy this learning they just will playing even if we give the distance learning in computer they just see it they they will start playing video game or they just will watch a video. Finally, we should give the student an opportunity they will enjoy it and they will not throw it away."

Its 1945 at a high school graduation Luke is talking to his friend Don Reist until suddenly Don asked Luke if he wanted to go to Europe on a cattle boat with him but Luke couldn`t say no to Don but world war 2 had ended and there is a lot of homes,facrories,grocery stores,and malls destroyed and in ruins and need to recover there food and animals and so 44 nations had came together to form the UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation. So the UNRRA hired Seagoing Cowboys to go to Europe and take care of the horses,young cows,and even mules that were coming from overseas so Luke and Don sighned up to help with the animals and Europe. So in August of 1945 Luke and Don got their orders to go to New Orleans. So on August 14 Luke and Don arrived in New Orleans the day the Pacific war was over both Luke and Don got their seaman`s papers and boarded in a ship called the SS Charles W. Wooster and was heading to Greece with a cargo filled with 335 horses plus a lot of hay and oats to feed the horses. So before Luke got to Greece he turned 18 which means that means that Luke can be drafted into the military service. So after Luke and Don did there seagoing cowboys they both had some fun on the ship like where they housed the animals they played in there table-tennis, tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading. whittling,and games that also helped pass the time."

To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, & more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA (the United Nations Relief & Rehabilitation Administration).

You get to take once in a lifetime trips around the world. It's also fun abord the ship, especially on the return trips after the animals have been unloaded. The cowboys and I played baseball & volleyball games. We also did; table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, & games to help pass the time. Being a Seagoing Cowboy opens up the world to you. So you see? Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for me. Even though it requires alot of work.

NASA and other scientist said it was a natural landform. The face was equivalent of a butte or mesa says NASA. The face is ether a buute or mesa landforms because it is common around the American West. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on Mars. It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Sanke River Plain of Idaho. If it was an airplane on the ground orEgyptian-style pyramids or even a small shacks, you could see what they were. Few scientist belived the face was an alien artifact. Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars. Scientist at the Jet Propulsion Lab saw it and thought it was another Martian mesa but it had an unusual shadow that made it look like an Egyptain Pharaoh. It had eyes, nose, and mouth as a human. Not everybody was satisfied that it was a natural landform. These are the reasons why I think the face on Mars is a natural landform and not created by aliens.

16750,0,"My position on driverless cars is I think they are a good idea because it would make long road trips easier on the driver. I say that because if it notifies the driver when something is wrong or they need to take the wheel I think it would make less accidents happen. It has a sensor for when people need to reverse the car and makes noises or vibrates the seat if the car is to close to something. Also in 2013 when BMW annouced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant"", the car can handle driving functions up to 25 mph. But the driver has to keep hold of the wheel so the driver would be alert at all the time if they need to take control. If we have all this stuff on the car like the ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" sensors for when the car is in reverse and it alerts the driver when they need to take over the accident rates would drop. People wouldnt be so careless when they drove too. Some people get tired of driving or they just want to be on their phone well when they have the driverless car all those probelms would disappear. They would just have to be alert when the car needs them to take the wheel. Driving may sound fun to new drivers but new drivers can be reckless and careless it would definantly drop the accident rates. The only bad think about the driverless car would be if something failed than it would be the maufactures fault. It is their job to make sure to alert the driver to take over and make sure everything works. But automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that problems ahead will be solved. They are expecting a car that can be on autopilot 90% of the time we just have to drive that last 10%. In 2020 three different cars are expected to be able to drive all by themselves. Making the driverless car better than they expected."
20454,0,"I belive that my state senator should remove the electoral colleges. To change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States. For the fact that voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors. Who can always defy the will of the people. It should also be removed because its simply unfair to the voters. There votes may or may not be counted or may vote for the wrong person or oppsite party. Also the problem comes up that the candidates do no go to there state thus never seeing them. To began with I belive we should remove the Electoral Colleges. For the reson that voter are not voteing but for a slate of electors. Who then elect the president, for example ""if you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry. You'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry.""(qoute form source 2) Those 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry may not win the statewide election. The voters also are not always able to control who there electors vote for. ""Legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" (qoute form source 2). So there a chance they may change there mind and the president they wished to win may not win because the legislatures do not have to vote in there favor. In some case seventeen states didn't even see the candidates at all. Some states including Rhode Island and South Carolina, ""and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" Also another reason why we should remove the Electoral Colleges is for the reason that voters may become confuse and vote for the wrong person. Futhermore we should remove the Electors Colleges, because its unfair to the voters. For example the winner takes all system in each state. Candidates don't spend times in the states they know they have no chance winning. ""It can be argued that the Electoral college method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state."" (qoute from source 3). But then what happens to the people in that wants to vote for them but can't because there votes go toward a slate of electors that votes for the other party. They focus on the swing states mostly. For Instance a Presidential race that happen were the electoral votes caused a certain party to win was. In 2000 U.S. presidential race, Al Hore received more in dividual votes than George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won the election, receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266. The electoral votes need to be removed because it causes problems in elections which makes any side able to win even though they don't have more individual votes. Another example is ""Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast on him."" (qoute from sorce 3). Study shows that 60% of voters would prefer a direct election rather then what they have now. On the other hand having the electoral votes may not be such a bad thing. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. The Electoral College also restore some of the weight in the political balance that large states. If you elect a good representive that you belive, and trust that will vote to your liking. Someone that would not turn his back on the will of the people then it would not be that bad. The process they go throught maybe difficult and hard to understand. So it could be a good thing they take the hard work off our backs and do it for us to save us the time and hardwork. The Electoral Colleges requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal rather then a single region appeal. To conclude I belive that my state senator should remove the electoral colleges. To change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States. For the fact that voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors. Who can always defy the will of the people. It should also be removed because its simply unfair to the voters. There votes may or may not be counted or may vote for the wrong person or oppsite party. The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational."
3956,0,"Since some schools require summer projects should they be teacher-designed or student-designed? I believe that the projects should be student-designed because it can make them responsible, gives them a chance to prove they are hard-working, and chosing it on their own gives them more of a fun learning experience. To start off, schools should allow the projects to be student-designed because it can make them responsible. Giving the student a chance of being responsible is a great way to help them in and out of school. Responsibility makes the student want to step up and prove they want to do good on their own. Teaching a student to be more responsible can get them far in life. In addition, if they are applying for a job or even if they are going to college showing that they are responsible is a good trait to have. Another reason, to why students should be alowed to pick their projects is because it gives them a chance to be hard-working. To show that you are hard-working you have to be determained to get the job done. For example, I am a student that is determained to get her work done in order to keep good grades. Being hard-working shows that you have self-direction. You can't find many teenagers that have self-direction. If a student can choose their own project and get it done that proves that they are hard-working. Finally, I can argue and say that teachers should pick the projects because they will challenge the students, teachers have more experience, and they would give the students a non-fun, but better learning experience. I agree, that the teacher would give the student more of a challenge, but what's the point if the student doesn't want to be challenged anyways. Teachers should give a fun learning experience not a boring one because it gives them a purpose into doing their work. This is why I believe that students should pick their own projects. In conclusion, even though schools require summer projects they should let them be student-designed due to it making them responsible, gives them chance to prove that they are hard-working, and chosing their own project gives them a fun learning experience. Students should understand with the acception of them picking their own projects they shouldn't slack off because they are getting it easy because teachers aren't challenging the student and giving them a non-fun learning experience."
8742,0,"In this article the author explains what Venus is at first, next he/she explains the benefit of learning about it and then finally talks about the dangers and challenges that come with studying it. Venus or the ""Evening Star"" is a planet similar to earth in size and density and is even reffered as earths ""Twin"". Yet these to are two very different planets, for example Venus's atmosphere suffers from the ""greenhouse effect"" which causes its surface temperature to average around 800 degrees fahrenheit! It also supports no life at least that we know of to this point unlike Earth. To study the ""twin"" of Earth we must first either put something on the surface of the planet or take pictures of the planet from right outside the planet. This is a problem because its so hot on the surface that it will melt our currant technology and with the greenhouse effect the atmosphee is to thick to take pictures through. This is obviously a problem for scientist who want to learn more about the planet Venus. If we do learn about Venus though it might benefit us tremendously because we will know how to prevent Earth from having the same problem Venus did that eventually destroyed the planet into what it is today. In conclusion I think the Author of this article realizes the dangers of studying eath's ""twin"" Venus but ultimantly thinks that the positives outweigh the negitives on this one and I agree. If Venus at one point really was like earth and supported life we need to know what destroyed it to prevent us from rewriting history. I think that outweighs any danger or problem in the longrun and Im sure the author would agree with me based on his/her article. Scientist as I type this are working on a solution for problems such as the ones up above and I wouldnt be surprised if we learned a lot more anout Venus in these next couple of decades!"
21683,0,Dear TEACHER_NAME I think policy1 would work butter because so many kids have cell phone any how and they us them when there not allowed to i don't have a cell phone but i think so many people would like that any how. kids that don't have cell phone could bring there i pods or some thing maybe. but if so many kids don't follow this i think it would be a good choices to try it if you don't then i think we can go with plan two. but it would be a fun thing for the kids that have cell phone and if they don't have a cell phone then they can bring some thing to do please let this work i think it would be fun for ever one that is going to flow the plane and if you don't flow it u will get in big trouble. and if you don't like it dwell over it i don't really care. about it it's not about one person it about the hole school and if you think this is s good idea go for it and try to lea son to what you are told so your school can have more chance for what they want and what there going to do with what you give then and if someone phone goes off when its not told to the teacher can take it away from you because you weren't fallowing instructions.
15063,0,"Dear principle, I personally don't think everyone should be required to do community service. first of all, we spend most of our day in school working hard so for us to get home and have to go right back out and work some more is not necessary or right. Don't get me wrong i don't have a problem with doing community service i just think we need as much free time as we can get. On the other hand, Some students don't really have anything to do or look forward to at home and some of us do. I have football practice, track practice, and even basketball practice i wouldn't have the time to do community service even if i wanted to. Some kids are in conditions were they cant do community service maybe because they're going through problems at home or they don't have an adult around to push them and encourage them to do the right thing. In high school its a requirement to have a certain amount of community service hours so if i don't se the point of us doing it now if we just going to have to do it all over again. In conclusion i think us students should be able to decide if we want to do community service or not because some of us either cant do it or just don't want to do it. So if our principle is forcing us to do something that we really don't want to do then its most likely not going to be done."
19131,0,"The Electoral College was originally established as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. Presidential candidate Al Gore actually won the popular vote done by citizens, but ended up losing the Electoral College voting which caused him to lose his campaign for presidency. To prevent further occurances such as the fiasco involving Al Gore, the Electoral College must go. Former Presidents Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter both happened to agree on the abolishment of the Electoral College! According to a Gallup poll taken in the year 2000, over 60% of voters would prefer a more direct election process. In other words, they want the Electoral College system abolished. Voters actually don't vote for President; they vote for a slate of electors who end up voting for the president. I feel that this system isn't cohesive enough; it's easy for people to think that a majority vote for a candidate means an automatic victory when actually the Electoral College votes are what truly matter. What would be the reaction if a certain member of the College decided to vote against his party's candidate? With a system filled to the brim with flaws, it's easy for many upsetting instances to occur in the future. In fact, the state of Louisiana almost succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. The Electoral College method is outdated, at best. If seventeen states didn't even get to see the candidates, then something is obviously wrong. Had 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii voted the other way, a tie would've occured in the 1976 presidential election. There is one, gaping flaw in the Electoral College voting system; the winner-take-all basis. A very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory! Another unfair aspect about the Electoral College is the fact that larger states garner more attention (and votes!) than do smaller ones. Florida netted candidate Obama 29 electoral votes whereas Wyoming snagged him 3 electoral votes. Such a discrepency can turn off potential voters such as Democrats in Texas or Republicans in California. Overall, the Electoral College is an outdated practice which must be invalidated soon enough."
8835,0,"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" believes that studying Venus is something that should be done even though it can be very dangerous. The author gives multiple reasons to why we should explore the planet, or learn more about it. However, some people think the dangers of Venus outweigh the benefits of pursuing research on it. The author supports the idea of studying Venus even though it can be very dangerous. He provides many details, and facts as to why it's a good idea. First off, the author tells what Venus is like. He states that Venus is often referred to as Earth's ""twin"". This is because Venus and Earth are close in size, density, and at some points in orbit are the closest planets in the solar system. It is also believed that at one point, Venus was a lot like Earth is now. ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" states, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our soloar system."". The article goes on to say Venus most likely had large oceans that supported life, and the planet has things like craters, valleys, and mountains that we also have here on Earth. The author including these details helps get the point across that Venus is a lot like Earth, and with the little research been done already, we've found so much. This helps readers understand that the longer Venus is studied, the more we will learn about it. Next, the author gives possible ways to study Venus safely, and effciently. The author states, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."". Stating ways that Venus can be studied with people not being put in danger helps get the authors point across. The article also touches on how floating above the surface could keep those studying the planet safe. Temperatures would still be high, but nothing the spacecraft couldn't handle, the air pressure would be like how it is on Earth at sea level, soloar power would be bountiful, and radiation would be no higher than the levels on Earth. The text then states, ""Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."". Although this would not be an easy job, it is possible to study Venus safely. The details used in this paragraph help convey the authors point that studying Venus can be done safely and that it should continue to happen. Last, the author gives more ways Venus can be studied safely using different technology. While talking about different approaches to studying Venus the author states, ""...simplified electronics...have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks..."". This quote also helps the reader understand that studying Venus can be done in a safe and harmless way. Using this new technology could help research on Venus advance, and keep those doing the research out of harm's way. The author then goes on to talk about a different technology that was used in World War 2 that can also be used as a new method to study Venus. These are called mechanical computers, and they use gears and levers rather than the electronics that actual computers use. The mechanical computers are made of mechanical parts which are stronger, so they shouldn't be damaged as easily. These are just a few of the ways technology can help safely advance the study of Venus. In conclusion, it is important Venus is continued to be studied and researched. The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" does a great job of conveying to his audience why studying Venus is important even though it is dangerous. In the last paragraph, the author says, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value..."". Studying Venus can help advance many things, and our knowledge of other planets could grow from this as well. There have been many safe ways found to study Venus, so it should be done. The author also states that, ""Our travels on Earth should not be limited by dangers and doubts..."". This quote also shows that the author believes the study of Venus should continue even though it can be dangerous. If we didn't study things just because they're dangerous, then we would have nothing dicovered. The author of this article believes the study of Venus should continue, and does very well at conveying that by telling the audience Earth and Venus are a lot alike, gives new, safer ways to study Venus, and gives examples of technology that could also make the study of Venus a lot safer and easier."
21511,0,"Dear Principle, Policy 1, giving rights to students to use their phones during their free time, is a better choice to choose since it makes the students more comfortable, make them feel more open-minded in school, and it can even help students in their education by having a source to help them with assignments First, it will be more comfortable for the students. Most schools are big, which is why some students lose their ways during first week of school. If you wanted to meet a friend during a free time or at lunch and you can't find them, what's a better way to find them than calling or texting them? Also, if you don't know where a new class is located, why struggle finding your way when you can text and ask your friend? Secondly, students will feel more open-minded than before. If you ask an average student, whether they like going to school, most of them, honestly, will say no. Now we can't change that answer since school's purpose is to educate the students and the students tend to not like it. However, we can improve the image of the school for the students. If we open the rights to use cell phones during their free time, they will feel way more open-minded than before. This is important because if a student hates going to school and has a closed-mind about it, it will give tons of stress to that student and may effect his/hers educational career. Thirdly, a portable source for the students. Nowadays, most students have some kind of smart phones or maybe just a regular cell phone that has a connection to a web or dictionary. Now imagine you were doing your homework during your free time and you don't know what a word means. Usually, if the right of using a cell phone was not opened, you would have to go to the library and check the dictionary. Now let's say that you had to research a certain topic. You would have to go to a computer in the library or someplace to do that. However, what if the all the computers were used by others. You would have to wait for a while to go on the web. If all these examples were changed to having the right to use the cell phones, you wouldn't have to worry about wasting time because you can do all of these at that exact moment and spot. By reading all of these reasons, I hope you'll choose the policy that's the better for the students. Sincerely, a student"
7850,0,"The principals want every one to at least participate in one extra activity after school. the students have to pick one or they won't be able to do it and the principle would get made at you because you didn't show up at any activity. some activity are basketball, football, soccer, and tennis. students can work on sports and the yearbook, and you can also work on a student sere vest council. yes because students can get the best out of it and you would get serves hours every single day and you get your blood flowing if you did one of those activities. since students are in middle school they have the right to do any activities at there middle schools and the principle said they would have to do it every single or on the days they say after. some middle schools don't have after school because of where they live or the school does not provided. the reason why i like after school is i get to participate in basketball games and help out with the yearbook and that is why i like talking about after school activities. students should participate in all of the activities that the principle gives them. i like that students get the aportuite to go to an event that people have set up and that some kids don't get gift that students get at after school and get to born off energy at school or at your house if you like to participate in activities or play a sport or do a yearbook club with your friends or do those things at school. people like to participate in things be cause the get out of your house or at schools, because at school your sitting on your but all day and night and your bones get tired. the principle give us thing to do because some kids get on there nerves and they give the students a activity to do after school so they can be tired when they get home or from work. some people like to do after school because you can get exercise and watch some TV when you get home or homework can be an activity because you are writing some thing down on paper or typing on a computer at school or at home and that is why principles give you an active to do at home or after school. some schools don't get the types of things we do at our middle schools. people don't like the idea because it would get kids in trouble because they would hurt people or be inapropite. that is why some school around the united states don't have after school. the principle give you these things to do is to keep people from doing wrong or do there homework and help out with the yearbook committed and also be the aprotuite to play some basketball after school and participate in a march madness basketball tournament after school at most of the middle schools and you can make your own team for 7th grade and 8th grade. people like to do this after school because they can still play basketball and get the aprotutite to play basketball. some people after school really like to do the yearbook committed because they can take pictures of grate classes and gym classes and then send them to a photo committed and then they put the photos in a book and then they call it the year book. some students can sign up for a position for a students council and it would be every single day after school. some kids don't like to stay after because they have things going on at there houses. some people like to stay after school because they want to go to homework club or basketball club or tennis club or football club and video game club and the last one is rubies cube club and all of the those clubs are after school Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. Thursday. Friday are the days they have the clubs and if you don't come you won't get serves ours and you would be stop by the printable. there are so many things you can do after school like go to basket ball and football and homework club and walk around with your friends and get energy out of your body because you have been sitting all day. one reason why i like to stay after is to do homework and play basketball with some friends or pick up a game of basketball and if there are none i try to make one. after school is really great because i get to do things like go see teachers if i have a homework assessment do the next day. after schools really great because students get to be away from there homes and don't have see them or get in trouble. so that is the story of me typing about after school works and the people that stay after are really nice people and after school has a lot of activities every single day except Tuesdays and Fridays are the only days that don't have late buses and also when you stay after school you can take a late bus home or walk or call your parents to come get you from school because all of the teachers have to go home to because so they can grade papers and get a good night rest for tomorrow or also the teacher would be very grumpy every day and that why i don't give a teacher hard time. there are so meany things after school and so i recamend staying after. that is why we need to extend the school day because we don't get a lot of time to do things like after school programs. if we had a extended school day we would get a lot of time to walk around the school and play basketball or help the pricipal with some things or be a helper cleaning up after people and cleaning people class rooms for serves hours on the days we have after school. the reason why we should a longer school day is because we can basketball games like the march madness and go to the rubies cube club and do homework and this is why we have after school so students can participate in things. the reason the the principle wants kids to participate in actives is because students go home and do not do there homework and teachers get made and that is why we have after school is so kids can get there homework done and also go see a teacher for help if they are after school when you stay after. some kids stay because so they don't have to go home and see there family and also they can get in trouble. the end"
22348,0,"Some schools offer options for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferences. Theres a ongoing debate between classes attended at home being beneficial and students would not benefit from home schooling. Those who believe students benefit from the classes at home state: there is a easier learning environment and more fluent pace of learning. Although some may disagree, I think students will not benefit from attending classes at home. There are a variety of reasons why students will not benefit from attending classes at home. First, the students who does home schooling usually are isolated from society. For example, them students grow up lacking social skills. They do not get any publicity since they are in the house most of the time. Another reason students will not benefit, is because they will not make friends. When attending a Public School or University, students are surrounded by people from all over the world. Therefore, students would like to be interested in their culture; eventually, becoming friends. The next reason, why students would not benefit from attending classes at home, is because they will not learn their own personality. The students at home will not get the experience of interacting with people everyday; in comparison, of the people who go to Public Schools or Universities. They will not be able to have character and when growing up be basic and controlled. There are furthermore reasons why, students who attend classes at home may not benefit from the classes. The preparation that students at home lose from the real world. Unlike classes attended at home, public schools prepare students for the real world. For example, student who do online or video conferences at home, typically are lazier than others. They wake up and decide when they would like class to start. At public schools, students wake up and have to make it to school by a certain time; in contrast to the real world with jobs. Another reason classes attended at home is not beneficial is because, the students lack maturity. The students will not get enough experience from society to become mature. For example, there will be a time were a situation come up and they will not know how to handle the situation in the right manor. Lastly, students who does attend classes at home, lacks the intelligence that public school students gain. For example, the students at home will not have the common sense like students at public school. In conclusion, students attending classes from home will not be benefited as those going to public schools. The students who attend classes at home will be isolated from society, wont be prepared for the real world, and will learn there own personality. Those who believe students benefit from the classes at home state: there is a easier learning environment and more fluent pace of learning. This topic is important because, some students or parents would like to be informed on the benefits of home schooling compared to public school."

It has gain a lot of attention from conspiracy theorist that belive there is life on Mars, and they belive an alien life form has created the face. While scientist are positive, that this is a natural landform like you see on Earth. However, conspiracy theorists ignore what the scientists say. If aliens had created a monument that looked like humans, how would they know what we look like in the first place? We have not seen or proven that there is life on Mars, and if they knew what we looked like, wouldn't we know what they look like? Many conpsiracy theriosts argue that NASA wants to keep aliens a secret, but NASA would love to find an ancient civilization on Mars. If they could find an ancient civilization that could be a break through in science and biology. When they took another picture in April 1998, the picture was taken with clouds in the sky, making it impossible to see the small things. The theriosts argue that they couldn't see anything, so on April 8, 2001 they took another picture. It was a cloudless day in the Cydonia region. They took aother picture of the phenomeun in full resolution, and that picture proves that the face is just a mesa or butte. The landform was even common in the United States. Many conspiracy theorists was wishing for this to be a momunment from an anicent civilization, but the facts are agaist it. In the high resolution picture you can see the crevices in the land that make up the lanform. With the ditches and holes in the land, it causes shadows that reemble the eyes, nose, and mouth of a human. NASA would be happy to find an ancient civilization on Mars, but they look to the information first."

18097,0,"I think that driverless cars aren't an appropriate idea for this time period. There are multiple reasons why I believe this. We would need to do a lot more developing on roads, we would need to put an abundance of sensors in the car, there would need to be new laws made, and there's no practical use to a driverless car. Firstly, there are very few roads in America, let alone Indiana, that would be suitable for a driverless car. Many roads have unexpected twists, turns, and dips that no sensor would be able to make a fast enough reaction time. If the sensors stopped working, or if there wasn't a fast enough reaction time, it would cause multiple wrecks. If we had to fix a majority of the roads for driverless cars, taxes would go up to pay for it. Nobody would want to pay that kind of money, especially when most people wouldn't be able to afford a driverless car. Secondly, there would need to be an abundance of sensors in the car. Sensors aren't necessarily a bad invention for a car, but people shouldn't solely rely on them. Multiple things could go wrong with the sensors, sometimes without the driver or car even knowing. If the driver doesn't know that a sensor isn't functioning, they could be relying on it to mimic them at the wheel. Multiple wrecks could happen this way, and the only person to blame would be the driver with the driverless car, because they're the car who had their sensors malfunction. Thirdly, there would be too many laws that would need to be changed and added. Paragraph nine says, ""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times."" A human driver is needed to make these laws and to enforce them. There would have to be new liability laws, and there would be conflict with the manufacturing company. Technology is the not the subject that should be at fault in this situation. The person who should be at fault is the driver, because the driver would be putting themselves, and everyone on the street at risk for driving a car that they are not in control of. Lastly, there's no practical use for a driverless car. Driving is a privledge for young adults and adults. People are not given the right to drive, but they're given the privledge. There couldn't be anything more important for a driver than to focus on driving. If driverless cars are released to the public, what would people do while their car is being driven? They could sit on their phones or do something that wouldn't be worth their life or someone elses. Manual cars have been around for an abundance of years, and they've been doing just fine. To sum this up, I believe that driverless cars are not worth the risk, or money, in people's lives. There would be too much developing roads and laws, and there would always be the risk of the driver not being in control of their car."

The first reason is kids can learn about themselves and others. Community service is a great ways to meet new people. Many can learn many great things about themselves and many others. Community service is a reason for kids to get out of the house. So there not inside on a beautiful day. There lives are being wasted and someone needs to do something. They need to do something with there lives. If they don't then they will not know what to do in the real world. They will then fail in life because they will not have experience with other people and all they want is ""There Way"". Most kids could use this so they could meet new people. For example that kid you sit behind in math class might be a pretty cool kid and he could help you study, so you can stop copying of him, you two might even like the same music. Kids can always learn for those older than them because they have lived longer and can help them more. all in all, kids can get a positive life started and can meet new people and can learn many things from community service. this is way community service should be required."

The text states ""A driver of a pickup truck killed a whopping 13 individuals in a Texas crash in the spring of 2017. 20-year-old Jack Dillon Young was behind the wheel of his truck and was texting while driving, causing him to cross the center line several times."" This informs you on how cell phone distraction could risk the lives of not only yourself but others as well.? people are injured or killed due to cell phone distraction. Cell phone disturbances have a big impact on car crashes and deaths. Cell phone distractions are very dangerous when someone is operating a vehicle. Distracted driving can include things like eating, drinking, talking to others while driving, and etc. Out of all those distractions cell phone interaction is the most common and dangerous. When paying attention to your cell phone it takes away the attention you need to focus on the road and drive safely. In a text on www.wikepedia.com it says "" Using a cell phone while driving increases the driver's risk of causing a crash. Drivers are distracted, decreasing the driver's awareness on the road, leading to more car crashes."" This simply means that the use of the cell phone while driving can result in a dangerous outcome. It is also said that ""4.6 secondspass when a driver's eyes leave the road to text at 55mph, it's like driving the length of a football field blind."" When a driver's eye is taken off the road the chance of wrecking another car or even running off the side of the road and harming yourself. The dangerous outcomes could be losing control of the wheel, crashing, running off the side of the road, harming others of all ages, running into objects ( poles, signs,cines,etc.), and the worst of all, death. Cell phone disturbance can be very dangerous when driving which is another cell phone should not be used while driving. People should consider certain things before picking up a phone. Things can be done to lower the accidents caused by the distraction of a cell phone. Companies have taken a huge step to decrease the number of wrecks caused by phones.Cell phone companies such as AT&T realized how big cell phones are distractions to drivers so they come up with programs. For example, a big program today is "" It could wait "". On the site www.independentmotors.com it describes the can wait program. It quotes ""AT&T itself has helped drive these conversations with its It Can Wait campaign, which has seen more than 7 million people take the campaign's pledge to drive more safely. The company also launched its DriveMode app, which keeps all phone calls and texts quiet while you are driving. The app turns on automatically when it detects that the user is moving faster than 15 MPH and turns off shortly after it detects that the user has stopped."" This shows how companies have noticed the danger of cell phones and have taken action onto fixing it such just like AT&T which is a huge cell phone company. Another program example is the Stop Texting AND Driving Distracted, or STANDD program. This program was launched by a lady who lost her son due to a texting a driving incident. The website states "" Like a few other organizations on this list, STANDD has its own app for iOS and Android smartphones. It starts up as soon as your engine does, and as long as you're moving more than 10 miles per hour, the free app deactivates any texts and calls that you receive, letting the caller know that you're unavailable with an auto-message."". This goes to show that there are ways to put an end to all the horrible incidents caused by texting and driving but it is all up to you. Programs have been made, apps have been released, and signs are around you everyday to remind you not to text and drive so do what's best and focus more on the road and not on your phone. A simple message or text could wait. If people paid as much attention to the roads than their phones there would be less wrecks or car tragedies. Cell phones are huge distractions on drivers. Drivers are put in harm once they pick up their phones to check a text, post on social media, change songs, make videos, and etc. Cell phones while driving is like taking a risk. People are put in life or death situations once being distracted by their phones when operating a vehicle. In conclusion the use of cell phones should be prohibited while driving."
25128,0,"Who's going to for help you? From who you go to for help is important, because going to the wrong person for your information will not help, but going to more than one person might give you different answers. Going to multiple people when seeking for help is better than going to just one person because the first person you go to might be wrong, you also get more than one opinion, and you get to learn what other people know. The first person you go to for help might give you the wrong answer. When looking for help you usually go to a trusted friend or adult. The thing is that when you only go to one of those it might make your situation harder, because when I got home from school I need help on some really hard math equations. So, I went to my trusted mom. My mom told me the way she did it when they were in school. Then I did it her way and when I turned my paper in at math class it was totally wrong. This was a perfect example of why we should go to more than one person when seeking help, because they might be wrong. Getting more opinions than just going to one person clearly doesn't help. So, getting more opinions is important because someone that tries to help you could make whatever your trying to do more difficult as you might get wrong answers. Also, this one time when I was cleaning our house and I was invited to mow the lawn, but I didn't know how to work it. For this reason I went to my mom and she told me it was just like a car and then told me the steps. But then I went and tried to turn it on but it was more difficult than I had thought. So the next time I asked for help I didn't go to my mom, I went to my dad. He told me a different way to work the machine that was ten times more easy than the way my mom did it. So, choosing from whos idea is better is going to make your job easier and help you do anything better. After asking for help you get to know what other people know. When you ask someone from your family or a known person for help on anything and you check the answer and there correct, then thats a person you can rely on for that subject. Just like how I needed help with working the lawn mower. My mom didn't know an easy way to do it but my dad did so now I go to my dad for chores that need help with that involves outside. In conclusion, when looking for help going to more than one person is better than going to one for help. You learn a lot more things doing it that way. Thats why going to multiple people when seeking for help is better than going to just one person because the first person you go to might be wrong, you also get more than one opinion, and you get to learn what other people know."

You would be able to take care of horses, young cows, and mules. You would get to sail overseas. You would be able to have free time on your way. When I say that You would be able to take care of horses, young cows, and mules I mean that there would be 335 for all the types of animals. You would also get to have the chance to sail over the seas and have fun because you would be able to sign up with your buddy and travel together. The last reason is that you would be able to have free time to see things that people may never get to see in their lifetime. After reading these reasons that I stated I hope that you consider joing the Seagoing Cowboys. These are the reasons why I think that you should join. You would get to take care of horses, young cows, and mules. You would also get to sail over the seas with you buddy or even by yourself if you want. The final reason is that you would get free time along the way to see things that people may never get to see in their lifetime."
13825,0,"Dear Principal, I am a concerned student body member of your school. I have heard that you are debating whether or not to make it mandatory that all students perform community service acts. I personally do community service, and I would like to weigh in on the opinion. I have to go against it, not because it isn't right, but because it is unfair. I think that if you maybe offer the choice for students to work community service hours and offer extra credit towards school in return then you will be more fair. To demand students to attend community service after school hours is outrageous. This would be unfair because you do not know what is going on in their life at that time. Someone in their family can be sick and in the hospital or maybe they have to attend a family meeting that they committed to. Whatever the case this would be unfair to them. I think that to some students this would be like detention because of the required after school hours, and having to come would be mandatory. A suggestion would be to force the ones in detention to do community service. This would make them feel bad about what they did, and you could help clean up the school by having them pick up trash. Even though they would be doing community service, they would also be doing good for the community or our school. If others feel that they want to stay after to help with community service then maybe you could offer extra credit in return. As I mentioned before, I myself perform acts of community service. I would not like to be recognized and one of your students who has to do community service. I would instead like to be recognized as one of you students who wants to do service. I like the sense of accomplishment when I help someone get something done, and you forcing me to do it would completely take that away. I would rather choose to do community service than have you make me. I can get what you are trying to say when you want us to all do community service. It would give our school a good reputation, and would make you feel better. Some students might be up for the challenge, but others won't come or wouldn't do a good job. I think that is almost cruel to force children to work. Even if it is for the good of the community. Like I said before, some children may not have the time to stay after school and do work because of issues at home. Maybe a good alternative would be to let kids do work around school durring the school day instead of after school."
22042,0,"To Whom It May Concern: I am writing this letter regarding your policy on cell phones during school hours. In my opinion, I believe Policy 1 is the better choice for our school. If cell phones are allowed to be used during free times and lunch, it would have a better effect on the students. As school goes on, the curriculum becomes more difficult which encourages students to study harder and focus more on getting higher grades. While their grades are very important, this may create stress on some students which may even lead them to get lower grades. Permitting the use of students' cell phones during school could possibly reduce the stress they have from being the studious children that they are. Having less stress and pressure on them may result in higher marks and eventually an exemplary school. This could benefit the school district greatly and this policy can be spread to other schools so that all of our campuses can be exemplary. Another reason why this cell phone policy could result in a positive outcome for our school is it could maybe even save lives. For example, if there is a fatal emergency in the cafeteria that involves choking, a student could simply dial 911 to get an ambulance there as soon as possible. There may be some issues when first putting the policy in order, but once students get used to the idea that they are allowed to use their phones during free time only, they won't bother with sneaking any texts during class. To prevent cell phone usage during class, students should be allowed to go to their lockers after lunch to put them away while under the supervision of an administrator. This keeps them from cheating on tests, contacting anyone outside school, and being distracted in class. I really believe this change in your school's regulation could help your students develop into a fully grade A campus and be even better than before. I am hoping for your kind consideration."
4014,0,"Just before the bell rings to dismiss students for year, teachers are struggling to keep the attention of students when explaining their summer assignments for the break. The students know that the summer assignments are important, but their attention is on the bell that declares summer vacation. Summer assignments are designed to ensure that students continue their intellectual journey over breaks. Both teacher-designed projects and student-designed projects accomplish this goal, however, one of the biggest challenges is deciding whether teacher-designed projects or student-designed project would do a better job at accomplishing this goal. The best way to ensure that students continue learning over break is to assign teacher-designed projects. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers have a better understanding of the material, the project will be less stressful for students, and teacher-designed projects will prevent misjudgment of students by teachers. Teachers should design summer projects because they have a better understanding of the material they are trying to teach. They also tend to have a clear understanding of what they expect from students for the projects they assign. By assigning teacher-designed summer projects, the teacher can guide the students to learn what the teachers want them to discover. They also provide a more specific rubric so the students know exactly what is expected of them. For example, AP Biology has a lot of material that needs to be covered in just one year. To solve this issue, they assign a teacher-designed summer assignment that consists of an introduction to each unit learned throughout the year. This way, students are prepared when going in depth with all of the concepts in class because they already have a grasp of the topic learned during break. By assigning teacher designed projects, teachers can guide the students to ensure that what they are learning and exploring can help them perform better in class. Another reason teachers should design the summer project, is that the project will be less stressful to students overall. Although teachers are expected to be unbiased, they will always have personal beliefs that may clash with a student's beliefs. During student-designed projects over the summer, students do not know the personal beliefs and preferences of their teacher because many students have not spent much time with their future teacher. Student-designed projects are often stressful in this situation because students do not always know the teacher's expectations. Students do not want to receive a lower grade on their project because of the biases of the teacher. Students also feel anxious because they never know if their project is unique enough to get a good grade and if the teacher will find it as interesting as the student. For example, many science classes require students to conduct experiments in a field they find interesting. Not only is this assignment very vague, but it is also unfair. There are many different ways a student could take this project and some projects require more time and effort than others. For example, testing to see the effects of personal care products that get into waterways on marine life requires a lot more time, effort, and materials compared to testing which brand of paint needs the least amount to coats to adequately cover the walls. Both of the projects meet the criteria, but one project may be considered better than the other by a teacher. This gives many students anxiety because they never know if their project is good enough. Student-designed projects are too stressful and often end up diminishing the quality of the student's summer break by giving them anxiety. Some teachers may argue that student-designed summer projects are an outlet for students to show their creativity. They believe that students can showcase their intellectual level by completing student-designed projects and the teachers can get a better understanding of their students' beliefs and preferences through student-designed projects. However, student-designed projects are not always the best reflection of the students and their work ethic. Many students go on vacation during the summer for extended periods of time and may not always be able to do what they actually wanted to do. Many students visit family in places that do not have the internet or adequate resources to complete the project that they wanted to complete. For example, if a student wanted to test the effects of personal care products that get into waterways on marine life, it would be impossible for them to do so if their relatives lived in an underdeveloped and remote village in India because they would not have access to the materials they need. However, with teacher-designed projects, students can work with their future teacher to plan ahead to complete the assignment or complete a different assignment entirely depending on their situation. Students would not be forced to settle for something that is not a true reflection of their work ethic because of their circumstances. Teacher-designed projects are the best way for schools to ensure that students continue learning material for classes during break without causing anxiety in students or misjudgment of students by teachers. Summer projects are meant to help students but student-designed projects can sometimes harm students instead. Every student should be allowed to spend their summer without stressing about how they will be perceived by their fellow classmates and teachers the next year. Summer projects should encourage students to continue to learning while also spending quality time with their family and friends during their break."
25056,0,"You should always talkk to more than one person if you want multiple opinions based on a topic. because it can give you more Results, Conformation, and Details. All three of these are things you can get from multiple opinions because if you ask ten people about one topic you will get more Results, Details, and conformation. So these three items to use can be very helpful in a situation. Results are a key of multiple opinions because each person has a diffrent side to one story. Going for results from a murder you have to interview people who where there or could have seen anything. And the results you get out of all of them you add it up to see which one could have been the culprit. So results are very important when it comes to many things because it can solve a problem. Multiple opinions can give you results just because you get alot of information from doing so. Details are a key of multiple opinions because details are specific information. The details can be like information that was left behind so multiple opinions have alot in common because some will tell a lie and some wont. So you use Details which are like items, emotions, etc to tell you what might have happened. A multiple opion gives you lots of things because your asking more than one person on a topic which doing this gives you details which you have to look for while talking to people. The amount of details you can get from one opinion is insane because you get more than ten or twenty to help the topic your are doing. Conformation is the biggest key of multiple opinions because even though details and results tell you everything you need to confirm everything before you make a descision. The conformation has to always be right because if you make the wrong descision it will cost you. Because you can ruin someones life or opportunitys based on your one wrong decision. So you want to make sure that you are one hundred percent sure on your decision before you do anything else. once you have made your decision there is no going back because you cant change what you did. Getting multiple opinions is always a good way to start something off. Because the results tell you what happened, details tell how it happened and what caused it, and conformation means you are one hundered percent sure you know the cause, and what happened. So sticking to multiple choice is good but always be careful use these three to get what you want out of a story or what you want to use it for. but you have to use them carefully because you dont know what might happen next."
324,0,People should not be able to use cell phone while they are driving in any capacity. The reasons they should not be allowed to use them is because they could seriously hurt someone or kill them when they are using their cell phones. When you are using a cell phone while operating a vehicle you are paying attention to the phone rather than the road. Let's say you were using your phone and you hit somebody and killed them what would you do. You would probably drive off and then call the police but if you did do that then they would check traffic cameras and the get your license plate and you would go to jail for a hit and run charge. But if you stay then you're going to either get a ticket for distracted driving or you could go to jail on a manslaughter charge so its up to you on what you do.
3762,0,"How would you like to do a boring project on your summer break? Doesn't sound fun, does it? Schools believe that during the summer students need to actively learn. They ensure students continue learning by giving them summer projects. The matter at hand is; whether these projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. It is the students project, so why shouldn't it be designed by them? In most cases, teacher-designed projects are very detailed and include many parts, the teachers expect too much from the students. A student-designed project can ensure interest in the project, teacher-designed projects become boring and there's a lack of interest. During summer break many students will go on vacations or visit family, having the students design the projects assigned can allow them to take into account the time they have available. Teacher-designed projects are very intricate and the teachers expect too much from the students. Teachers have high standards. High standards can be good during the school year but for a summer project this can become very stressful. There are a plethora of components to a teacher-designed project, research, citations, outlines, rough drafts, and countless more. These projects force students to push themselves. Many might argue that its good for students to push themselves, but it is summer break after all and students have been pushing themselves for about ten months. These students are tired and adding stress to their vacation is cruel. Doing a project you're uninterested in can be very bland and boring. Teachers don't think about how uninteresting a topic or project can be to a student. Not having interest in a topic can be very detrimental to a students grade and the effort they put into the project. The same reaction can come from a boring class, students will start to loose focus, dread doing the work, or not put in any effort. I've personally experienced doing a project I had no interest in. I subconsciously procrastinated which lead to turning it in very late. I could not focus on the task and was drowning in work by the time it was due. If a student were to designed the project they could choose a topic they were genuinely interested in. This would set them up for success and they could have fun learning something new. Summer break is commonly associated with spending time with family and going on vacations. This is the case for most students. Giving students a long, details, mandated project is time consuming and takes away from their vacation. As a child of a divorced couple, my summers are filling with traveling to see my dad and spending time with him. I've personally experience having a summer project that I had to take time out of seeing my Father to do, which was upsetting because I only see him once a year. It's students like me who would love the chance to design their summer projects. Given the chance to design their summer project students can ensure for themselves that it will not take away from their own plans and it will encourage them to finish it in a more timely manner. Some schools assign students summer projects to assure they continue to learn during their vacation. These projects should be designed by the students. The projects should be student-designed because teachers have high standards. Due to these high standards their projects require students to push themselves when all year that what they've been doing. Lack of interest plays a huge role in many teacher's projects. Teachers aren't doing their best to assure that their projects spark some aspect of interest in their students. Having no interest in a project can cause the student to procrastinate and not do their best. Lastly, students have complicated schedules in the summer, many go away on vacation or spend time with family. Having a teacher designed-project that's time consuming can take away from their valuable time. Letting students design the project can ensure they will have enough time to work on it and will encourage them to finish it earlier. Student-designed projects can benefit the student immensely in multiple ways, where as a teacher-designed project will let them down and cause unnecessary stress."
23257,0,"Offering distance learning can be extremely beneficial, depending on the child. Some children often feel safer at home than they do in school. Often times this can be due to bullying, mental disorders, or the desire to be at home with people they can trust. Children might also benefit from having one on one conversations with their teachers. In a public school, children might be nervous or scared to ask questions, give answers, or put themselves out there when they need help. An environment that makes sure a student is comfortable, will ensure that all questions are being answered. Finally, the education provided to a student at home is no different from the material public school students are learning in a classroom. Personally, distance learning seems like the perfect choice for students who have a hard time learning in a public school environment. These children have the opportunity to obtain a personal connection with a teacher, they are still getting a good education, and are more comfortable at home than in school. When a child does not feel safe at a public school, this can distract their ability to learn and think. Many adolescents are bullied, which can cause a variety of mental disorders. Bullying disturbs a childs thought process and mental health. Mental disorders are becoming a larger problem than ever. Children can be diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and anger issues. These problems can all stem from being in a public school. When a child is at home, they do not need to worry about the bullying as much and can focus on their school work. Being around people that make you anxious will hinder your ability to retain knowledge. All a child will think about are these people who are making them feel sad, anxious, or angry. If a student decides to learn from home, they have the chance to ignore the people or things that make them feel bad and focus on their education. Children who are in an environment that make them feel safe can often go out of their comfort zone. Often times, students do not ask essential questions becuase they are scared of scrutiny from their fellow class mates. This can leave a gap in a students knowledge of the topic. For example, if a student is learning a subject that is tough and their questions are not being asked, true comprehension is not being obtained. Being in a one on one setting can give a child a better chance at asking essential questions. Another upside to learning from a private teacher is the personal relationship that is gained. When a teacher better understands you, they have the chance to teach the way that a child needs. In a large class room, the teacher does not get the chance to teach every student individually. All children learn differently, and some can not learn any other way. When a teacher better understands the student, they can teach the way that the student will benfit from the most. The teacher can also get to know a student on a deeper level. Having a connection with a teacher is extremely difficult in a large classroom. When a student and teacher can connect, the chances of the student being more enthusiastic about learning is higher. The students drive to exceed expectations is also higher. Being in a one on one setting gives the teacher a better chance to understand the student and what the student needs. This also gives the student the chance to better understand the expectations of them. The children who are taught from home are also recieving the same education, if not better. The cirriculum and subject matter is the same as what they would be learning in a public school. These children also get the opportunity to take the subject at their own pace. If they need more time digging a subject into their brains, they can get extra time. This might not be the same for public school students, because all students move on together regardless of anyone getting left behind. In public school, if a child does not understand the material, there is not much time for a teacher to review a topic before they have to move on. When it is just the student and teacher, the student can ask as many questions as needed and the teacher can answer the questions that that student has. Some children are slower learners and others are fast learners. It is hard to have to follow someone elses learning style and still have to understand the material being given to you. Often times public schools have programs for the slow learners and the students who need extra help with test taking, but it is not enough. These programs at public schools can help students with test taking, but they do not ensure that the child is learning everything they need in the classroom. The distance learning program seems like it has many positive outcomes. In contrast, I do not believe this program is for everyone. Many students benefit from being in a larger, more social environment. For the students who can not handle public schools, this program is the perfect choice. It provides each child with the chance for an equal education, while getting the extra help they might need."
3763,0,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Many students forget their knowledge they had learned from the previous year and struggle to find their way and the following year. To prevent this some schools have mandated a summer project to continue the education for their students and to be able to have successful following year. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because, teachers know how to prepare students for the following year, students are not capable to create a project idea, and to continue learning for students teacher need to be able to establish their curriculum. Teachers prepare students for everything involving education, so for a summer project to establish education, it should be teacher-designed. Many students in, Generic_School, unknowingly don't receive parental support, causing them to need teacher guidance. Students cannot achieve everything to do with school by themselves, they need guidance and help. Parental support is a key thing to education in the 21st century, without it students can tend to give-up or not achieve their goals, this would include a summer break project. Teachers are the ones given the curriculum, of what they need to teach, at every school. The curriculum, is a state-wide given material, consisting of the learning objectives for the students, The students would not be able to gain more knowledge without knowing what their objectives are for the following year. A student-designed project would quickly fall apart without knowledge of what they need to be focusing on for the following year. Many students do not have the capability to be able to come up with project idea. An extraordinary amount of students deal with focusing problems, such as, ADHD. This causes many students to not be able to create and design a ""summer"" project all by themselves; Students will need guidance form teachers. To be able to design and create a project during a students break could possibly be a hard task, even if they don't have a focusing problem. Most to all students have different levels of achievement. How would teachers grade the different levels of effort put into each project if every students was designing their own? One student could create a beautiful poster, while another just writes a paragraph; How could this be fair to all student if they were designing their own. Many students go on trips or visit family and are unable to take time out of their day for something them have to come up with and/or have the mindset to put effort in to designing and creating a project. To allow students to continue learning, the teachers need to design a project in order for them to learn. Students do not teach themselves in any school. For a student to gain more knowledge they need to be led and taught by someone who already holds that knowledge. A teacher knows the objectives the student needs to know for the following year. The teachers obtain the future objectives from the state, for the students. The students have no idea what their following grade objectives are, as they have not even been in their future classroom yet. Many students would not be capable of continuing learning if they do not receive any material on their project, and have to design their own. A successful student has the future knowledge handed to them for them to be able to create a project continuing on learning future material. To prevent forgetting knowledge, some schools have mandated a summer project to continue the education for their students and to be able to have successful following year. Allowing student to design and create their own ""summer project"" seems like a bad idea, if the school is assuring learning. All students are not capable of preparing themselves the curriculum for the following year, if they are unsure about the material. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because, teachers know how to prepare students for the following year, students are not capable to create a project idea, and to continue learning for students teacher need to be able to establish their curriculum."
25478,0,"When you get stuck on something whether or not it is to buy a cat or buy a dog. You always ask someone their opinion right? If you don't, you really should it can help you make great decisions like, whether or not should you buy that cat or chose that job. Thats why Im here to show you why asking opinions with multiple people is a great thing. Lets say you want to go on a cruise and you ask your friends and family their opinions about money wise, your friends most likely think its really cool, worth the money you can pay it off right. Your thinking, ""Yeah, this sounds like so much fun and its not that much I will work over time."" On the other hand your parents are thinking maybe its not so worth it your already in college dept that you need to pay off why have another thing. So you think to your self, ""Maybe shes right this would be fun but I just really cant pay for it right now."" This is why it is so important to ask multiple people opinions because they may be bias to the subject or don't want the best for you. Lets say you want to buy a dog, your first dog. You dont know much about taking care of dogs so you ask a few people their opinion on your choice, your family loves the choice even though they never had a dog. So you go to ask your friends they say, ""Yeah! You totally should do that, it would be so cute."" Now you go ask a experienced co-worker he says, "" Your dog can be one of the best things that happened in your life but you have to find the right moment, because if you work to much and cant take care of it its not worth it to you and your dog. Also it is a lot of money and time, you have to pay almost 100 dollars a month just to feed it on top of your time, taking it on walks in the morning, middle of the day, and at night. It just not might be fit for you right now."" So you take that into you pile of opinions, sure its fun and cute but maybe your not ready for it, its not fair to the dog. This is also another reason why you should ask multiple people their opinions. Because somepeople may say something to you you never thought of before. So you want to either go to the army or the navy and you need help with choosing, you love the land and the sea so thats not a problem. You go to ask your family they might be full ride or not they love you so they dont want you making a decision that could maybe cause you your life. Now, you ask your friends about it they say army because its cooler and you get to shoot guns. You realize they wern't much help so you ask a army man and a navy man, they tell you all the things you have to go through in training and in the real world, you think about all the posiblites and dangers for going into it you havent thought about when you asked your friends. You realize sometimes asking people can change your life tremendly, it also can save your life, and change it forever The whole purpose of this was to show you that asking multiple people for their opinion can help you and the others around you a lot, you get to see the whole story, maybe they are experienced in the topic, or if the people you ask have no knowledge you know to just go to more people for more opinions. Thank you for reading this and I hope I changed your mind on asking opinions."
24558,0,"One morning, Generic_Name the Pterodactyl hopped outside of his old nest. The nest has been in his family for generations but had started to wear down. The twigs were falling out left and right and they would poke him while he slept. Not to mention that it was located in a dangerous neighborhood. Generic_Name decided it was time to sell the old nest and move into a new one. He asked his pterodactyl friends where to move in. Generic_Name the Pterodactyl said, ""you should move in with me and we could be roommates!"" Generic_Name thought about it, but politely declined his friend's offer for Generic_Name was a messy house keeper and only played video games. He then asked Generic_Name the Pterodactyl who answered with, ""I know a great realtor by the name of Generic_Name the Velociraptor."" Later that day Generic_Name looked up Generic_Name on Boggle, the search engine for dinosaurs, and found that Generic_Name was a pretty sketchy realtor. Finally he asked his good friend Generic_Name the Pterodactyl for advice. Generic_Name was not only a good house keeper, but also knew the Jurassic Area pretty well. He told Generic_Name, ""Make sure to look for nests that are in good neighborhoods and are in good condition."" Generic_Name was a great help, and after many hours of research, Generic_Name was finally able to call another nest home. Some people often ask for advice from multiple people (or pterodactyls in Generic_Name's case). Seeking multiple opinions on something can help give you clearer and better feedback, and can even help you decide for yourself. The more trials you have in an experiment, the more accurate your results will be. Let's use Generic_Name for an example. If Generic_Name had only listened to Generic_Name, then he would be up to his ankles in empty potato chip bags and energy drinks. It was because he asked multiple pterodactyls, that he was able to get the right advice. This doesn't mean that Generic_Name was planning on being messy or that Generic_Name was trying to scam Generic_Name. They were just trying to be good friends. From a scientific perspective, when planning a science experiment, you would want to have at least three trials. This is because something out of the ordinary could happen in your first trial and that it usually takes at least three trials to recognize a pattern in the experiment. If you are asking for advice - don't pick your favorite person. When I say this I mean people like your parents, your boss, etc. Although they could have good opinions, you might listen to them more than the other people who are trying to give you real feedback. Not only that but you don't want to have a person to lie to you and say that there was nothing wrong with your outfit or that your story didn't have confusing plot lines, when they both do. But on the other side of the feedback spectrum, don't pick someone who is going to crush your spirits. I once had a teacher in 6th grade that inspired me to learn more about the world's history and pushed me to learn. I even considered being a historian when I was older. Then, in 7th grade, I got a 72 year-old teacher who instead of having us learn about the Spanish-American War - stopped the whole class to look at pictures of his grandson. Don't get me wrong, I love looking at adorable picture of babies. But during the year, I lost my love for history and never thought about being a historian since. So what I'm trying to say is that you should pick someone you trust and that you respect and know that they will do the same for you. Although seeking multiple opinions can be helpful, you should also go with your gut on things. Facts101. com says that your gut is right 85% of the time. I've been in the scenario multiple times where I circled an answer on a quiz, but convinced myself that I was wrong and circle another answer. So I turned in my paper when I was done and my teacher graded them. She gave them back and it turned out that I was right the first time! Whenever I need help deciding something I try flipping a coin in the air. Before it lands, I most likely all ready know what I want because I'm hopping for it to land on heads so I can go out with my friends instead of getting a early start on my chemistry project. If you ever need help deciding something try using this trick. To sum up, seeking advice from multiple pterodactyls - I mean people, can give you better and more honest feedback, and can help you decide for yourself. So don't be afraid to ask for opinions because in the end it might just help you soar. Get it? It's because pterodactyls have wings! Anyone??"
18622,0,"Is keeping the Electoral College a good ideal mr/ms senator? Well if you ask me i say no. Why have it? Say the article voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electors but who elect the president. Because of the winer takes all system in each state it's unfair to the voters and it's unfair to me so changing the election by popular votes for the president of the united states would be best. To begin with Having popular votes instead of keeping the electoral college will be better because keeping it will only cause more trouble i say. Why? Well the electoral college is know for being the ""Disaster Factor"" Sad cause not only they have a bad name for there self the Americans are also most worried about the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. Because of the focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states candidates hardly or mostly dont have time to put up any campaign ads. The stress of worring about the electoral college can be tuff, they dont even have to put any signs or ads. Crazy cause it's just this one process thats only counting of the electrol votes for congress. In concusion the Electroal College consists of 538 electorals. Say the article only 270 eletroals are required to elect the president. In the article the system allows for much worse, but wrose as the election crisis in a century? Well i think so! Not even think i know so. Electors have refused to vote for their party's candidate and cased a deciding vote for whomever they please. It's all happening, everything i said in the begining...about the trouble. Why the senate gets to choose the vice president? why cant the qualified citizens choose for there selfs. That whole area needs some enjustments before they start chooseing for people."
20048,0,"Dear Senate, it is evident that many people think electoral voting is the wrong thing to do. I think that we sould use another method of voting like popular voting. I feel this way because the president that you might be voting for might win the popular vote but because he had lost the electoral vote he doesnt become president. I believe this is wrong because the president with the majority of vote by the U.S. should win, people should be able to decide who is president, and because I think its wrong to not give the U.S. citizens what they want. Although electoral voting may seem good its not because you dont really vote for your president that you want your voting for a slate of elector that pick the president they would rather have. In ""Source 2:The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defense of the system are wrong"" it state that ""Under the electoralcollege system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president"" From this we can see that its shouldnt be like this because the people should be able to choose the president who they voted for. also in source 2 it states "" The single bets argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" This just show how bad electoral voting can get. So we need to change the way of voting before it gets out of hand. After reading the passage I see another problem that electoral voting causes, which is that electoral voting is unfair to the people of the united states. It states ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning focusing only on the tight race in the ""swing"" states."" this just explaing that candidate that know that they cannot win your states votes wont even bother to try. People might feel that electoral voting is the best way to vote because we've always used it, and because it restores some balance that me be needed with larger states. But their still wrong because electoral voting has caused many problem for us in the past and how dont we know it will not cause them in the future. that why we should change our way of voting. Electoral voting is a bad method of voting because it is unfair to people, most of the time your not even voting for the candidate you want, and because its like of vote don't count on whether or not we get the president that we would like."

The principal run the school but he shoudnÂ´t make joining a activity a priority. ItÂ´s more than life than just school to me. We are in school for eight hours straight no talking, no playing, no phone just more and more work. Teachers think itÂ´s easy coming to school for eight hours straight following all these rules. There are rules everywhere u go but in school itÂ´s rules that teachers and staff know they wouldnÂ´t be able to follow. They still put pressure teens most students not even teens yet. They want us to come to school for eight ours straight wake up at 6 in the morning come to school be quiet sit up and write in a hard chair all day be quiet to your spoken to by a staff or teacher. IÂ´m not built to be bossed around basically that is what school is you got sumbody thats not your even your parents telling you what u can n canÂ´t do every 5 seconds like u a a slave or something. I thought that was over years ago well thats wat i learned in school. ItÂ´s not that I donÂ´t appreciate help I do but, everytime you dont follow directions or miss a day of school everybody make it seem like u a clown or a dummy because you dont wanna be here in school learning some things you dont even need in life. Some teachers and staff in this building are not even here cause they care and wanna help. Most teachers and staff are here for the money and to help they self. I donÂ´t depend on these teachers to help me better myself so many days of school cause my pride and it be alot going through my head. Then itÂ´s like if you in activites after school you can be kicked out for anything u do. We kids we make the most mistakes in life especially when you this young. If you dont follow directions or your grades slippin they say and do anything to get you to listen to them and follow what they are say. Soon as a athelete mess up these teachers and staff use that against them tryna take something away they know we love doing like basketball,football,soccer,hockey,golf and tennis it just seem like all that is on the line when your not in school listening to what the people in the school are telling you to do. I am strongly disagreeing with the decision the principal made. Because I dont know what is going on with my family why i am at school joining activites. My life different from all these other kids and most likely hard thatÂ´s why i wouldnÂ´t consider joining no activites right now. I wouldnÂ´t want to waist nobody time tryna help me cause its guranteed im not going to make it everyday i dont even make it to school everyday. School, teachers and staffs taught me alot, but somethings i had to find out the hard way. Everything i just typed is why i disagree with that decision."
23780,0,"Some school offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home. I personally think it's a bad idea because you won't get that much help, do stuff individual, and won't be the same as attending school. If students wants to attend classes from home. Well I recommend not to because you wont get any help from the teachers. yes, you can call and do a video conferencing but it just wont be the same. For example, there was this one time that i was sick for a week because of the flu. So I emailed my teacher what I miss and her respond is to look it up on teams. Like how am I suppose to know what to do. And she wasn't any help at all. That's why its a bad idea to not attend at school. Another reasaon why I think it's a bad idea to attend classes from home is that we do stuff individual. At school we have the option to work in a group with people to do our work sometimes. For example, lets say that the teacher let you work in groups. And you're in a group of four. Well some of us dont have to do everything. That's we have to do a little to cooraporate with the group. Meaning you don't have to do the work by yourself. That's why it's a bad idea to stay at home and do work by yorself. The last reason why I think it's a bad idea is beacuse it won't be the same as attending school. You could also stay in a club or do sports. School is the best way of learning new things and socialize with people. They also havve soccer games and dances that you can go to. Plus you can get some good food from the cafeteria. That's why they should attend school. In conclusion, I think it's a bad idea to attend classes from home. By staying at home you won't get stuff done. Won't even have frinds to talk too and maybe not understanding some work."
12168,0,"""So, if you're a NASA scientist, you should be able to tell me the whole story about the Face On Mars, which obviously is evidence that there is life on Mars, and that the face was created by aliens, correct?"" No, twenty five years ago, our Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. Us scientists figured out that it was just another Martian mesa, common around Cydonia, only this one had shadows that made it look like an Egyption Pharaoh. Very few days later, we revealed the image for all to see, and we made sure to note that it was a huge rock formation that just resembled a human head and face, but all of it was formed by shadows. We only announced it because we thought it would be a good way to engage the public with NASA's findings, and atrract attention to Mars-- and it did. The face on Mars soon became a pop icon; shot in movies, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years. Some people thought the natural landform was evidence of life on Mars, and that us scientists wanted to hide it, but really, the defenders of the NASA budget wish there was ancient civilization on Mars. We decided to take another shot just to make sure we weren't wrong, on April 5, 1998. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter camera team took a picture that was ten times sharper than the original Viking photos, revealing a natural landform, which meant no alien monument. ""But that picture wasn't very clear at all, which could mean alien markings were hidden by haze"" Well no, yes that rumor started, but to prove them wrong on April 8, 2001 we decided to take another picture, making sure it was a cloudless summer day. Malin's team captured an amazing photo using the camera's absolute maximum revolution. With this camera you can discern things in a digital image, 3 times bigger than the pixel size which means if there were any signs of life, you could easily see what they were. What the picture showed was the butte or mesa, which are landforms common around the American West. ""But how do we know you're not just hiding things from us?"" You should know NASA isn't hiding anything from the people because if there was evidence of life it would benefit us, so why hide it? If you still don't believe the evidence the pictures are out for you to see, which obviously shows a natural landform. The reason to not believe these movies and magazines is because they ignore the research. They make up things to get the people going, but what they actually should do is pay attention to us, because we have very important findings every single day."
24827,0,"Don't you always go to others when seeking advice? The more people, the better right? Getting advice from multiple point of views weighs on making the right decision. Its better to seek multiple people for advice because there are different point of views, some are older and wiser, and if you don't use their advice you can still use it in the future to come. Wouldn't two views be better the one? If you were to hears someone view on the situation and don't agree with it, wouldn't you like to hear the other side? When one gives you advice from their view and you don't agree with it, you can still hear others input on it. If you were to only hear out one person, would you think you would have the best advice? When asking for advice people naturally ask multiple people. They want to see others view point on the situation. if you want to have the best advice, you would ask people from different stand points. Remember the old saying, ""The older the wiser."" That comes in handy when seeking advice. Since the elder have more experience with life they have a better stand point on things. Others might think that the elders don't know what they're talking about since they are from older times. Some think since they are form older times their advice is what matters the most. When getting advice you should at least ask a few elders to know where they stand. This way you will have point of views from the older older generation. In addition, when getting stand points from others that would work in a situation. You can always go back on it for another situation. Sometimes people give right advice but for the wrong purpose. While you may be getting this point of view from one person, you may keep it for another situation. Later on when you need another point of view. you can go back to what someone told you that would make sense for a particular situation. Getting different point of views may help in one situation, it could always assist you in another. All in all, asking more people for their point of view will result in better advice. If one view doesn't work for you, you can always ask others. It is better to seek advice from multiple people because there are different point of views, some are elder and wiser, and if you don't use their advice you can still use it in the future. More point of views the better."
14237,0,There are many things that students do after school like play sports or video games. students need to get out in the community by do things that could help. one of the things that could be done is improving peoples life's like going to soup kitchens and severing food to the people that are less fortunate. one time when i was 10 on Christmas my mother and father took my brother and I to a soup kitchen. when we got there were so many people there that didn't have food that they could give to there family's. one lady hade 5 little boys alone she couldn't get all the boys food that they need so i gave her the food that the soup kitchen was giving me for working there she was very thankful for what she had that it made me think more about helping people. Another time when i went to the homeless shelter was when i was 13 and we were caring food that was donated to give out to the people and this old lady came up to me and asked if she could have some food as we were caring it in and i said yes so we brought her in and gave her some food and she started taking about how she became homeless and it really touched home on what she was saying to me. it made think back to all the times that i have hade it easy and how i took it for granted. One of the most important things we could do probably is go to special needs places like give Kids The World this organization gives kids that have illnesses that are going to kill them the chance to go to Disney world and do all these things before they are going to die with there family they stay there for a week and have time with them and then they leave. the reason i think this will be a great place to go for kids is because it will make them see how much they will love there life's. another thing to is that they will be working i n places that will teach them how to deal with special needs people. that's some of the reasons why i think that comminute sevice will help kids learn.
10967,0,"This new technology is very useful to find peoples emotions or even to what they're thinking about. But also it can be very bad to read other peoples emotions because it can become very personal. I say this because what if a kid is having a bad day in the class room and you read their emotions or even thoughts, it can be very rude. An example would be what if some kid was aving some hard times at home before they went to school and they're thinking about what happened the night before they went to school or what will happen to them when they go home from school. But this new technology can be very helpful because what if that student is struggling in their classes and they're too shy to say anything or to get any help. It can be very stressful and may lead to the student to want to just shut down and shut anyone out. But if you had this tachnology in the classroom it can help the student, becausse then the teacher will know that there is something wrong and try to help the student out with his or her problems in a different way like in tuduring only that select student. Or the teacher could go up to the student and figure out what's wrong and persude the student to be more open and talk about what all is wrong. But like I had said it can be very helpful or very harmful in ways."

Cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emission"". Thats why its important to cut back, If not... They could ban driving. For Example the article ""Paris Bans driving due to smog"" Paris almost of near the record pollution, so paris enfored partial drivng ban to clear the air of the global city. And there was 1 article about ""Car Free Day Is Spinnning into a big hit in Bogota"" talks about banning cars and only transportation is bike, walk, and busses. In the article ""German Suburb,Life Goes On Without Cars"" people who ownes house has to pay for Parking space stated ""Car ownersship is allowed but they must buy a parking spaces which can cost up to $40,000"" cause of this people who dont have money rather buy a house instead of a car so they dont have to pay $40,000 for a parking space. 70% of Vauban's families do not own cars and 57% sold a car to move to germany. ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" Paris bans driving becuase after days of near record pollution, Which made Prais enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Mortorists with even numbered license plates were order to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine which is $31 in USD. And some drivers dont even enfored the rule for example ""4,000 drivers were fined for not coperating with the rule enforced by paris offical. Diesel fuel was the blmamed since France Car which is made up of 67% of cars fueled with diesels. its a good idea for Paris to ban driving for certain amount of days because it can clear the air up with pollutions. In ""Car free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" they have banned driving for 3 straight years. the only transportation you could get around is buses and taxis is permmited for the day without cars in the capital city of population of 7 million. People who violate the banned of driving could faced a $25 fines, the turn out was large, despite gray clouds thay dumped rains showers on Bogota. As the mayor says ""its a good oppertunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" in this case i agree with the mayor because having a stree-free pollution can lead to a heathier state and a clean enviroment. ""The End of Car Culture"" President Obama ambitous goals to curb the United States greenhouse gas emissions. Many sociologists believe it will have benefical implications for carbon emissions and the enviroments, since transporation is the 2nd largest source of american's emission. For example companys like ""Ford and Mercedes have been rebranding themselves as a mobility companines. with all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habits. Company who offer transportation for example in New York theres a new bike sharing program to reduce car transportation. So as a fellow citizens its a good idea to cut back and save on money, and pollution to our planet earth. everyone wants a clean and safe enviroment. One thing you dont want is your country to ban or limited driving which makes you take the city bus or call a taxi."
22966,0,"Online and video conferencing learning is becoming more popular in school systems throughout the country. Some schools offer distance learning as an option to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. While many students would love to stay at home and complete their school work, it could easily lead to many problems that could be prevented. Students would not have the ability to make friends or interact with other students face-to-face. Some students might prefer a classroom environment to help with the abilities to learn better. Online or video conferencing classes could lead the students to become less motivated or lazy. Ultimately, I disagree that students would benefit from being able to take classes from home. Many students like to attend school because they get to see their friends and interact with new people. Having online classes as an option would take this away from students. Students would take advantage of staying home and completing their work. For example, students would have the ability to talk to their friends online but not actually talk in person and have an actual conversation with them. This could lead to losing friendships and even ruining their social skills for later in life. Therefore, students would not have the opportunity to meet new people or interact with their friends if they were taking online classes. Other students would rather have a classroom setting than an online computer based setting. Students tend to learn better when they are in a classroom environment and can interact with a teacher. For example, if a student needed help with an assignment in a classroom, the teacher would be present and ready to assist them. If the student was taking an online course, it could take longer for the teacher to response or become available online. Having an online classroom setting could lead the student to not do well in the class or even cheat to get the assignment finished. Therefore, having a classroom environment with a teacher would be more beneficial for the student rather than an online environment. Opponents argue that online or video conferencing learning would be beneficial to students more than learning in a classroom. For example, students would be able to work at their own pace in the class and do the amount of work they wanted to do that day. This would allow the students to be less stressed and more relaxed when learning. However, these online or video conferencing classes could lead the students to become lazy or less motivated to do anything. Becoming lazy or less motivated could result in assignments being turned in late, putting off every assignment due until last minute, or not even completing the assignments at all. Doing this would result in the student becoming behind or even failing the class. Therefore, students would not benefit from taking online classes due to the possibility of becoming lazy or unmotivated. Online and video conferencing classes would not be beneficial for students. Taking classes at home comes with many problems. Students could lose friends they have had for a long time or their social skills could decline. The students would not have the ability to take the classes in a classroom setting and have a teacher present during the class. Some students may even become lazy or unmotivated to complete these courses and the assignments with them. In closing, students would benefit more from being at a school taking the classes than having the classes offered online at home."

I think other kids should try to help out and not try to make stuff up and help. some other people care than others and they will help out but i don't think they should get forced to do it and help out. if other people could take some of there time after school or something i think that would be a good thing to do. Other kids or people might not like being around other people like that and some other people could be fine with that. sometimes people don't like that because maybe grown up like that and it bothers them to be around other people.
21455,0,"My opinion for this school is Policy 1. I think it should be policy 1 because, sometimes friends can't talk to each other during school, so if you let them use there phones they could stay best friends or buddies. Another reason why i think we should use phones is, people get bored at lunch so they should be able to text or listen to music on there phone, because we sit at school for 8 hours anyway. I have two more reasons why we should be able to use our phones at school, what happened if you left your lunch at home, and you don't have money in your lunch account or what if you left your clothes for gym or for sports pictures. We should at least be able to listen to music during lunch, because its not going to distract or disrespect someone. That's why we should be able to listen to music and use our phones during school. Kids can still learn during school, because there not wasting teachers time, there wasting there free time."
20395,0,"Electoral college votes are used to elect the new president, It consists of 538 electors and a majority of 270 must be won by a canidate to be elected. The ammount of electors is the number of memberis in its congressional delegation; One for each member in the house of repersenatives, Plus 2 for the senators. There is also a pouplar vote which is used to see what canidate is the more pouplar one, But this is not used to select the winner. I think the pouplar vote should be used because if the pouplar vote for one canidate but electoral vote is higher for the other the one with the pouplar vote is clearly the one people want more. I think that the way someone is elected as president should be changed from who has the most electoral votes to who has the highest pouplar vote. For example say you were and 16 other people were sitting at 8 different tables, 2 people are at all the tables, Your voting on which is better mashed potatoes or sweet potatoes, you all have different numbers, and say yours is the highest, which ever you voted for would would basically win unless no one voted for it, Which isnt fair in a real election. In a election the candiates focus more more on the stated with more votes such a california or florida, And if they get the bigger states vote they've pretty much won. All in all the electoral college isnt fair, the pouplar vote is how we should elect our president, so lets change this and see what happens, Maybe it wont work out that well, we'll just have to try and see."
15147,0,"Dear Principal, I strongly agree to your new ""B Average Policy"". I feel that many students focus too greatly on sports and not enough on academics. With the new policy i think a change will happen in test scores and the schools overall grade. Though I'm sure many students will be writing to change your opinion on the policy, I recommend you stay with it. Mrs. Principal, many students are determined that they can make it into the professional league with his/her' s sport, but frankly the chances are very slim. I feel with the new policy it will at least motivate them to do better in the classroom before they go out on the field. If the school's average could go from a C to a B then the school could earn all sorts of awards such as most improved and most motivated. Not only would this give the school a better reputation, but it would also nominate us in the county and state to receive equipment, such as new computers, Smart Boards and new text books. All of this would be caused by the new policy too. The possibilities of what the ""B Average Policy"" will bring are limitless. I strongly recommend that you stick with the policy, and continue to urge students to do better academically. Thank you for your time. Sincerely, A Concerned Student"
14479,0,"Dear Principal, Community service is important for children to take part in I believe it should be a requirement for school. Helping out the community does take time away from what they need or want but in the real world you have to give time up for others. Community service is great way for kids at this school to grow. This task of helping will make them more giving and willing to help out, which is a great characteristic for a child to have. Simple tasks of service will help them be more responsible. They will have less time to finish what they need to, but it will have the children buckle down and be more efficient and responsible when it comes to time management. Community service also gets kids involved with their own community and have opportunities to help out and make the community a better place. By getting involved they are helping out the community and their self.Also it'll change the out look that many kids have about the community and they will have a better understanding of how a community functions and its problems. Community service does no harm it only helps the person participating in it. Simple services like cleaning up litter can make the community a much cleaner nice place to be in. That simple task will also teach the volunteer recycling methods and teach them how to treat things with respect. I believe community service should be a requirement it helps teach kids to be more responsible, giving, and caring. Children should have those qualities in their character and community service is a way they can explore the community and be a better person. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME"
14789,0,"Dear TEACHER_NAME, Concerning your choice on whether to make all students do community service or volunteer. I think you should let each student make their own choice. Many people probably have things to do and people to see, so therefore they won't be able to attend the event. I can understand that you may assign everyone to attend the event because some of us can be lazy. I would prefer to come down and help with the clean-up because it would be the generous thing to do. Being able to clean-up your community is wonderful and you should be proud to do it. Taking care of your surroundings is just like taking care of your home, because it is your home. Sure, i would love to come and pick up trash, waste, and recycle a little too. I wouldn't care what my friends who didn't want to clean-up say i would go and help out my community. There is too much time in a day for you to just sit around and waste it, so get up and help out and show some respect to those who really care. To show elementary students that you should clean your community will make them appreciate this world instead of making it into a litter ball. For example, i would wanna be one of the leaders of a group as a position."

When the student is in home he going to do what he want he don't care the class he going to feel like if he don't have to do have to work in that class and he don't thing if he going to lost the class, one example is one of my friends he have a oline class but when he is in home he dont work because he dont care because no have one teacher who says ""Work or you no going to pass the class"" and thats one reason. My second reason is when the student is taken online classes he just going to finish, he no going to learn because he dont care learn he just going to complete the leasons but just that, why? because he dont have the teacher who explaing when he have questions or when he is interesting in something of the class he no have the teacher who know more abaut that. Some people says when the student take the online class from home he are more concentrade however whent the student take this classes from home he are more distractic because he have the cellphone in his hand or he have the TV in the room, the dog, the play station and he going to prefer play or see movies than work on the classes. In conclusion thye student can no work, no have the teacher for question or warn he can lostr the class or are more distractict or prefer play than work on the class are my reasons for no take online classes but with the good students can be a good idea."

9620,0,"The author talks about how Venus could have been similar to Earth many many years ago. The author says that Venus could have been exactly like Earth and how Venus could have been just like Earth when it came to supporting life. But later on in the article the author started to talk about how Venus' atmosphere is really dangerous and how its atmosphere is so dense that a person wouldn't be able to make it through there without burning up, and not that many forms of light would be able to get through the dense atmosphere either which meant no videos or pictures of Venus' ground and what it looks like. "" However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective""( The Challenge of Exploring Venus 6). This proves that Venus' atmosphere is so dangerous that even if you were able to make it to Venus you wouldn't be able to go inside of its atmosphere because it is so dangerous. This also proves that since there are dense clouds formed around the inside of Venus' atmosphere you can barely see through it which means that you wouldn't be able to get any pictures or videos, and if you did manage to get a clear look at Venus' ground you still wouldn't be able to take a picture because light can't get through the dense clouds in Venus' atmosphere."
8529,0,"Exploring Venus I wounder why Venus called the ""Evening star"" I think venus sometimes call the evening star because its a bright planet and it shine like a star & its the second planet from our sun. And venus referred to earth's twin because venus is the closest planet to earth. If I was an anstronount I would love to explore venus because it would be fun to be walking on venus. Most people should join venus just to see how it look and how is it. I think NASA as our jet airplanes travel at higher altitude to fly over many storms to go into space and explore many plants. The national aeronautics and space administartion have done a great job when they go into space and discover planets. I think it is very cool to go on other planets venus is sometimes closers to mars. The earth rotated its self and people dont nocited it. The sun is the hottest planet in the solar system it is over 100's degrees. Long ago venus was probaly coverd largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like earth. Today, venus still has some features that are analogous to those on earth but venus is one of the best planet in the solar system."

Driveless cars are not safe because it makes people lazy, gets rid of all driving laws, and technology isn't always as great as we think it is. The world is already lazy, so why would you want to make it more lazy? We already have machines, computers, and phones doing everything for us. Machines make everyday things but people get paid so much for pressing a button. Computers do everything for us. Phones answer all our questions. Now cars are going to be driving themselves. And what are the people going to do? Sit back and watch. Then all we will be doing is having everything do it for us and we do nothing. Not only will the people be lazy, then there will not be laws like there is today. What is someone gets hurt? Who are you going to blame it on? People do what they do and how they do it for a reason. If people want to drunk drive and drive high then they should be punished for the bad things they do and not have a car doing everything for them and be as if it's a way out of trouble. Now that there isn't much laws and we have robots doing everything for us there is only one thing we depend on. That is technology. Technology isn't the greatest. Have you ever got mad while being on a computer or a phone? Why is that? It's because technology didn't work as well that day. What are you going to do when you're in a driveless car and it decides to just stop? You're going to get hurt. Now you're hurt and no one is reliable because we thought technology was the greatest thing. All in all, driveless cars are not safe for today's society. They are not safe because it makes people lazy, laws will be cut in half, and technology doesn't always work. We're here to make something of our lives and not have technology do everything for us. So go out and have a life."
22802,0,"In our modern era, the reality that American public schools have yet failed to implement online learning programs nationally comes across as a damning testament to the slovenliness and archaism of educational bureaucracy. I believe that allowing students to attend their classes from home would benefit students, educators, and administrators as a whole because of the isolation from contagious sicknesses as well as the efficiency passively attributed to being able to learn from the comfort of one's own home. The idea of implementing online learning programs on a national level to isolate students and staff from contagious illness and disease perhaps sounds bombastic and reactionary at a first glance, but many of the greatest epidemics of the twenty-first century have been due to the proliferation of disease by child and adolescent carriers. For example, the recent pandemic-level outbreak of the novel coronavirus in America has led to the closure of all public schools in Seattle, Washington. By ensuring that children and adolescents can obtain a proper education online and from the comfort of their home environment, fewer people as a whole get sick and fewer carriers can actively spread a given malady. In addition to the aforementioned benefits of online public education, accessibility to immunocompromised and/or older teachers & immunocompromised students opens up significantly and such individuals can obtain a quality education with mitigated risk. The second main benefit of attending classes from home is the simple fact that it is, by and large, more comfortable for most people to learn from their homes than it is in another less familiar environment. This comfort breeds and leads to an increase in efficiency due to a student being better able to focus with less of the brain partitioned to ease the stress of being outside of its home. Better focus, however, does not solely stem from a comfortable learning environment, but is rather amplified by the lack of distractions from events in a regular classroom or other students, allowing for an equal distribution and ratio of teacher attention to student performance rather than behavior or minimizing distraction. Grades will go up, costs will go down, and teachers and students can mutually gain from one another. The slow lurch of schools nationwide toward progress must be substituted and replaced by an accelerating stride toward the future of education and the inevitable ubiquity of online learning to better suit the needs of the students of the current and next generations and to give rise to healthier, cheaper, and more productive learning environments that all people should benefit from."
8790,0,"Venus, a planet that neighbors Earth that can also becalled Earth's twin, not because of them both looking the same, but in term of density and size. The author suggested that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents for us. You may be able to ee it from a distance but getting on it is a whole other challenge. Earth alternates being closer to Mars or Venus, humans have sent spacecraft to land on Venus but are failed due to the fact that no spacecraft has ever succesfully landed and survived. The atmosphere around Venus is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide, and surroning it are clouds of highly corrosive sulfric acid in the atmosphere. It states that ""On average the temeperature of the planets surface is 800 degress Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greated than what we experience on our own planet"". Compared to what we feel on Earth humans adaptablity cannot match with the intense surface and temperature of Venus having even the power to crush a submarine, known for diving to the deepest part of our oceans and can even have the ablility of liquefying many metals. Having said that, Venus not even being the closest to the sun has the highest surface temperature and with thr high pressure and heat it had additional impediments that we as humans can not adapt to our work with. Venus has been known to be the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Assumptions being made say that Venus was like Earth with forms of life and having oceans cover it just like Earth. To this day it has some of the features that Earth has and being on how close it is it can be our nearest option for space visit. NASA has had an idea on how to study Venus ""a blimp like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditons by staying up and out of their way"". By being above the surface the air pressure would match the sea level for Earth's solar power and radiation would not go past Earth's levels. The conditions not being easy but survivable for humans. To this day scientists are seeking to conduct a mission on how to get onto Venus and understand it regardless of the risks. Having tested products like simple electronics, they have made a chamber simulating the time and estimating on how long it would last to stay on Venus's surface and have lasted three weeks in the conditions Venus is made up in. Even with danger in the explration it should let us expand our reach to get closer to Venus. Seeing on how much work and effort people put into the discovery of a new planet shows that with time and innovation we can succeed in exploring Venus and what new things they can discover."
102,0,"Phones and Driving Having a cellphone when driving is dangerous. Dangerous for you and the people around you. Most people lives are taken each and every day by a simple act called ""Careless Driving"". The act of texting and has come across from this new generation. Statistics show that this behavior is common and dangerous for teen drivers. 1.2 million car crashes in 2013 involved drivers talking on the phone and at least 341000 involved text messaging. Texting while driving is worse than talking while driving. Talking while driving isn't as bad because your focused on the road but at the same time, you're trying to listen to someone else's conversation, and you try to get over and you think your focused and you're not then boom a car crash. Texting while driving as to be the worst thing ever and causes more effects and injuries. Texting while driving you have look down at your phone instead of it being in front of you the boom when you rise back up to see the road, you're on the other side of or about to hit a car. Statistics show that 37,461 lives were lost on U.S roads in 2016 an increase of 5.6% from 2015 until 2017. Also, in 2015, there were 3,477 people killed and an estimated additional 391,000 injured in crashes involving distracted drivers. So, it seems that texting while driving is way dangerous then talking while driving its many proving facts you get kilt faster while texting and driving. They have cars today that can stop people from having cellphones in their hand. Bluetooth is more optional and more used in high classed cars for more protection, but still can cause accidents. There our laws today that can send you to jail containing the driving and texting which is if you don't have a car that has Bluetooth or a stand for your phone then you're not able to use it and your will get a ticket. To conclude this please don't text and drive if it's not meant to do. You can save a lot of lives mostly yours. More lives are saved every day because its less wreck less drivers and more safety."
16817,0,"The idea of these ""Driveless Cars"" does sound intersting and at the most fascinating. But however i'm going to say i'm all that for that particular idea for a few reasons. And to start off I don't see how it would be called ""Driveless Cars"" if there is still human assitance requried. To me this isn't all the way driveless driving its more like the car assistaing you most of the time. And this could also cause problems betweem the drivers and the companys responible for these cars. The way I may see it is why spend thousands of dollars creating something the requries human skills you might as well not even make it. And with this creation is something not everyone can afford. If one driver has this creation but the may not this would most likely lead the driveless car driver to accidently hit the car or drive that has a driveless car there are also still chances of acidents. So if not everyone can afford a driveless car why even bring it out for people. And the fact that manufactures want to use camera to watch the driver can be uncomfortable to the drivers. And by also having to change laws here and there if this vehical is realsed nto everyone may follow or agree with them.There's people now that can't even follow the simple rules of driving. And this could also lack people's precaution or alterness in any type of car or anywhere else. And if its times for the driver to do his or hers part what if they are on there cellphone like most days now and when they are alterted they look up and its to late. Its relly important that a person is alert at all times and take their own responibility. While the details and positive benefits these ""Driveless Cars"" may sound great but the neagatives can also affect people. And the negatives can also put someone in the chance of danger."
2564,0,"Suburban cities are buzzing with traffic; every person is trying to get some place as fast as possible. Whether it is a business meeting or their child's soccer practice, a car is the preferred transportation method. But there is a new initiative across the globe that is growing in popularity: the idea of living without cars. Several urban cities have participated in efforts to reduce the traffic in their home, because of the numerous harmful effects it has on the people and the earth. Three cities have subtracted cars out of their daily routine and reaped the benefits. The United States has also procured benefits because of the decline in car usage. In Vauban, Germany: citizens live without cars, in Paris, France: driving restrictions were placed to help control the pollution, and in Bogota, Colombia: an annual ""Day Without Cars"" is put into effect. These efforts have proven to have multiple advantages. The articles, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" and ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elizabeth Rosenthal, The United States and Vauban's unique situation is discussed. Robert Duffer explains Paris' predicament in his piece, ""Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog."" the final source is from Andrew Selsky, ""Car Free Day is a Big Hit in Bogota."" Limiting and abolishing the use of personal automobiles is helpful to the environment, the city, and the people. When Paris, France is mentioned, people think of the Eiffel tower looming over their head. In reality, what is really dancing over their hair is smog. The classic city has experienced record high polution rates in the previous times. The government has decided to do something about their predicament. Duffer explains the measures they took, ""On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day."" The efforts that the French made to prevent pollution proved to be extremely successful. Because of the strange weather conditions, the smog had become trapped in a layer of air, causing their smog count to rival Beijing's, the most polluted city in the world. Paris adjusted to the bans by making all public transportation free and making certain exceptions for hybrid cars and cars carrying three or more people, Duffer explained. Although some deliery companies were not happy with the restrictions on their driving, the smog drastically cleared enough for the city to abolish the ban and all numbered plates were allowed to drive after only a week of the ban. In a new and revolutionary city, cars have actually been banned from the premises. Vauban lies in Germany, near the French and Swiss borders. Aside from main thoroughfare, the streets are primarily car free. And the locals think that it pays off, ""'When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way', said Heidrun Walter."" The motives behind this are due to the harmful greenhouse gas emission from so many cars. Rosenthal cites the statistic that, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas in Europe.. and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" With car-less cities like Vauban, the greenhouse gas emissions are close to nothing. Citizens walk, bike, or pile on the bus. This method helps protect the environment and have people enjoy their daily lives a bit more. In Rosenthal's other article, about Car Culture, she explains how the car industry is declining anyway, and how the United States could be headed for no-car societies as well. ""Car ownership per household and per person has started to come down in the past two to three years."" The abolishment of car usage helpe protect the environment and reduce the greenhouse gas emissions. In Bogota, Colombia, a new kind of celebration has been put into effect. The ""Day Without Cars"" is an annual day in the capital of Colombia where the use of cars is not permitted. Substitute activities include: biking, hiking, taking buses, and skating. Selsky wirtes that the goal was to encourage the citizens to use public transportation and reduce the pollution that clotted up the airways in the people. The only mode of transportation allowed was buses and taxis. There were twenty five dollar fines handed out to those who violated the rules. Selsky explains, ""The day without cars is part of an improvemewnt campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city."" These bicycle paths have helped to promote the non-polluting modes of getting around Bogota. The day has proven to be a success for not only Bogota, but other Colombian cities as well. On the third anniversary, Cali and Valledupar participated in the event as well. The capital city of Colombia has seen drastic changes in the condition of its city. Seltzky claims that recreational parks have popped up and the sidewalks have improved to put them in a better condition. Rush hour regulations have even been put into effect that have dramatically reduced the bumper to bumper traffic in the city. Bogota, Paris, Vauban, and the United States have all proved that eliminating the usage of cars is beneficial to many aspects of the world. Each city has adapted it's own way that attests to the assets of not using cars."
24281,0,"Students of the United States of America have you ever wondered what it would be like to do school work from home rather than actually go to the school and learn there. Students in college have had the option to take online courses instead of actually attending a college class directly for a while now. Now some high schools are beginning to offer up a similar program to students as of recently. Students it is a lot better to do school work from home because students would feel better in a familiar environment therefore allowing them to work more efficiently, a school could also save much more money on transportation costs allowing a school to have a bigger budget and finally the recent COVID-19 case has scared much of America today, so by allowing students to work from home there is a substantial decrease in the case a disease like this spreads quicker. Although some may argue against this by saying that if students don't have access to computers at home how would this work. There are many ways to get around this such as giving the students school issued laptops for a year allowing them access any programs they may need at home. Also in the case has a school wide exam they can use their school building itself as a testing center for students. Although there are many opinions beside this one to consider. First off, students feel better and work more efficiently in a familiar environment. Many studies have shown that people who work from home are less stressed; therefore, they work much more productively then they would in a unfamiliar environment. For example, a student typically who is very studious may be distracted by other students who disrupt the working environment, working from home would allow the student to be much more efficient do to the less distractions he has to deal with, therefore they will earn better grades. This is not the only reason students should have the option to do school from home. Secondly, the school itself can receive many benefits by giving the students the option to learn from their home. The school would be able to receive to save much more money on transportation, due to the reduced number of students a school would need to give a ride to school. For example, many schools today suffer from a lack of available transportation for students making it so many if not a large portion of students miss attending school do to this. Allowing students to work from home works in both turn for the school and the students. This by itself may sound impressive but this is not all benefits allowing students the option to work from home has to offer. Lastly, students, parents and staff who have fears of any disease, epidemic or fear of general security in general may find it much more viable to allow students the option to work from home. Many people around the globe have voiced their concerns over the recent epidemic known as COVID-19 which has struck fear in many people of today's society. For example, say that the epidemic gets so bad in the USA that parents are refusing to send their children to school, than the school could still have those students work from home without any disruption, allowing the school to continue to run as intended. So students of the USA it sounds like a pretty good deal overall, and not just for you but many others benefiting many while helping a lot more. Students should be allowed the option to attend school from home because students would work more effectively from home, schools could save much more money on transportation and finally students, parents and staff would not have to worry about any disease or epidemic, such as COVID-19, from spreading to them any time soon. So make sure to voice you're support on allowing students the right to attend school from safety and comfort of their own home."

Same students don't have Enif time to do an after school activity, students's parents might not be able to pick them up, I think students should not be forest to do a after school activity. My first reason is, students don't have Enif time to do an after school activity. Students have homework to do after school. Students might be spending time with his/her family. Students might be doing comity serves. My second reason is, students's parents might not be able to pick them up. Their parents might not be at home. They might be working. They might be at a dentist or doctors adornment. They might be out of town. My third reason is, students should not be forest to do a after school activity. Students hate being forest to do something. Students wont like the activity. They should be aloud to do what they want, and not be forest to do it. Students will do it if they want to. In conclusion, I think students should not be forest to do an after school activity if they don't wont to. Students don't have Enif time in the day. Students's parents can't get them. Students should not be forested to do after school activity."
22086,0,"Dear Principal, I understand that you are reconsidering the school's cell phone policy. I realize that you are considering two policy. Allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class. And, not allowing students to us cell phones at all at school. I think that you should allow students to use the cell phones during free time. I believe that you should allow students to use their cell phones. If they can use their cell phones during free time they won't have the urge to use the cell phones during class. When they use them during free time they talk to all the people that want to talk to. Some people don't get to see their friends during free time so they will most likely call or text to their friends during free time. If they cant call or text during free time at all they will try to text during class so that they can talk. If students cant bring their cell phones to school then they could not use their phone for after school activities or an emergency. There are some disadvantages to letting students use their cell phones during free time. One, letting them use their cell phones during free time makes them want to text or call more so, they might do it during class. ii they do that then it will take away from their learning. It could go either way on this decision. But, being a student i would like to be able to use my cell phone during free time. I also do a lot of after school activities so, i wouldn't be able to call my mom for a ride if i needed one. I think the parents would choose policy one because some parents like to keep in touch with their children."

With the new program Facial Action Coding System you can make a 3-D model of someone and scan the face mucsles to tell you what emotions they are feeling. You have six basic emotions that this program can detect just by your mucsles in your face. When they scanned Mona Lisa's face she was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, 2 percent angry. Now if people start turnning towards this method of telling how people feel instead of asking them to make them feel better then you are shutting yourself off from society and that's not okay. If you want to now how someone feels don't make a 3-D model of their face to have a computer tell you just go up and ask them how they feel and what will make them feel better. It amazes you when you find out how many people turn towards technology instead of face to face converstations. Fianally if you scan someones face to see if you can make them feel better than you are doing it all wrong. You need to walk up to that person and say ""Are you okay, what do you need to help you"". Also when you do scan someones face they can put on whats called a ""Fake Smile"" and trick the computer into thinking it's a actual smile, so it will say they are happy when in reality you are mad or upset.

23917,0,"Many schools offer classes from home or online to students, however it is contreversal whether it is beneficial to students or not. Students will benefit more from going to school rather than taking classes online or from home because students will get the opportunity to join clubs or sports teams, learn better social skills, and gain more life experience. Going to school gives students the opportunity to join many different clubs and sports teams. When in high school, there are so many opportunities and options for students to choose from no matter who you are. When I first came to Generic_School in the 10th grade, I missed the tryouts for the Volleyball team. I was upset, however I was still given the opportunity to manage the team where I met one of my best friends and made new relationships. I would have never had this opportunity if I had taken classes from home or online. This year I am a junior, and I recently joined National Honors Society, which is a very good club to be in and looks great on college applications. This is another example of an opportunity that is not presented to people who take classes from home. Going to school teaches students better social skills as well. Being around teachers and students all day can allow people to be better at communicating, rather than just being at home or online. School is where I have met almost all my friends from preschool to now. If I had not gone to school I would have never met my friends or had the same relationships, so I would not have been able to talk to other people my age as easily. Being around teachers and authorities all day also helps with adapting ways to talk to adults and to know how to be respectful. High School has helped me a lot with knowing how to communicate better and to speak up, before I was very shy and would rarely talk. Altogether, Going to school helps people to adapt better communication skills. Life lessons and experience is another example of what going to school provides for students. When attending school you naturally will experience and learn more then what you would if you were at home, whether or not it is apart of a lesson plan. Teachers and adults teach students basic discipline and give rules, which can be good. Even when I was a kid, I was taught to not interrupt people and how to get along with my fellow classmates. Going to school, I naturally experience more every day then what I would if I was at home or online taking classes. This can be as simple as just listening to another student, or our teacher telling the class an important life lesson. It is important that students get to experience what going to school can teach them. Although some schools offer distance learning by staying at home or taking online classes, it is important to go to school. By choosing to have distant learning students will miss out on school clubs and sports teams, adapting better social skills, and many life experience and lessons"

Since you have to be away from your family, you won't be able to see your family in about three years. If you can go three years without seeing your familly then you have forund your job. Besides helping people, you are able to see awsome sighting and go to places that you've never been before. You are able to go and see Europe, China, the Acropolis in Greece, Crete, Panama, and you could go to Italy. On paragragh five it states "" Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing Acropolis in Greece was special,"" he says ""So was taking a gondola ride in Vencie, Italy, a city with streets of water."" Luke also toured an excaveted castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his was to China. So, in conclusion I belive that you can, and should join the Sesagoing Cowboys. Only if you are able to parcipitate very well, and if you won't have a problem with all of those things you have to do."
4589,0,"I've never had to complete a summer project before, but I know some schools do. The students may not be too thrilled about it, but these projects help them be more engaged and continue learning while they are on summer break. There are different ways that school can help make these projects at least a little bit more bearable for the students, like letting them design it themselves. Some people may believe that summer projects should be teacher-designed, but projects that are designed by the students themselves gives them more creative freedom, makes the project more enjoyable, and teaches students new things even when they aren't at school. Student-designed projects give students the creative freedom that they need to help them get through it much easier. Whenever given very specific instructions with little to no room for creativity and individuality, it makes it very difficult for me to get through the project. I know that most students love to put their personality into their work, and when that option is stripped from them it becomes a lot less interesting to complete. When teachers let kids express themselves through their work, more often than not, the results that come out of it are much better than if they weren't. Letting the students help decided the requirements and aspects of the project makes it much more enjoyable than if the teacher were to just give instructions and everyone has to just do one thing. I hate doing projects most of the time because I'm always just given a topic and requirements and am let go to just do whatever work the teacher gave me. I've always found it much easier to do projects when we are allowed to choose what we do them about things that we truly enjoy learning about. It's no surprise that students probably don't want to be spending their summer break doing homework, but giving them a project can actually be quite beneficial to them academically. By assigning a summer project, students have the opportunity to continue learning even when school is out. When teachers let the students decide for themselves exactly what the project should include, they are going to have a lot more fun with it; in fact, it may actually help them complete the project and impact their studies even farther. When given the opportunity to research something that they are truly interested in and passionate about, the outcome quality would be truly wonderful. Some people feel that summer projects are more effective when created by teachers because it gives students a similar academic basis for what they should be working on; however, student-based projects are a better choice because it gives more creative freedom to the students, the project itself becomes more enjoyable, and helps students continue learning even when out of school. Kids love being able to do things they are passionate about, and letting them help with assigning their own projects gives them the opportunity for greatness."
14994,0,"Dear TEACHER_NAME, I think that it is a great idea for kids to help other kids by doing community service.It is even better when they volunteer themselves. That shows that those kids care about their peers and want to do something positive for the community. On the other hand, some kids think that community service takes too long. I'm not judging because some activities do in my opinion take to long. Maybe I could suggest some other things that those kids could do. For an example, some kids could recycle or not leave the water on while not in use. My aunt use to recycle cans. I never really thought about it but now i understand that, that was a good idea. Instead of throwing those cans in the trash, she was actually saving materials. I also learned last year about my carbon foot print. I learned that leaving water on, leaving the lights on, and using the air conditioner could be replaced with a better idea. Plus leaving the water on and lights on when not needed is wasteful and instead of having the air conditioner on, an open window would probably work. Not only does it run up a monthly bill. Its just wasteful when not being used. Those are just some examples of ways kids could do good by not doing a lot. Now that I think about it. i once sat down at the dinner table and ate half of my food and was planning on throwing the rest away, but my mother stopped me. She explained that some kids, my age and younger don't get to eat. So I should be thankful and not throw away food that some other child could be gladly enjoying. In conclusion, the moral of this letter is that i feel that some kids shouldn't get discouraged from doing something for their community. It doesn't have to be major, like painting a house. Instead it could be something simply, like not littering. Yours Truly, STUDENT_NAME"
14645,0,"Dear Principal, It is a fact that most students would rather spend their time at home or out with friends, but I think that it is a great idea for students to get involved in community service. It builds character and allows students to get involved within the community. Doing community service reveals opportunities for students when they are older, it lets them see the realities of the real world, and it also puts a smile on other peoples' faces. Community service is a need for the community. Those students who don't do community service never get to see their likes and dislikes in jobs, so it may be harder for them to find a profession in college. When students spend time doing community service, it reveals jobs a student may want to do once out of school. For example, if one likes to work in a nursing home, it doesn't mean that one is going to get a job in a nursing home, it shows that one likes to take care of people and that means that person would be good as a doctor, nurse, or anything involving people in need. When people pick up litter, it does not mean that those people are going to be garbage men or something of that nature, it shows that they care for the environment and wildlife, and may consider going into a field that involves them. By doing these things, it also gets students out of the house. Being shown to the real world is important for any young person. Reason being that if they aren't, they will not be prepared and probably will have no idea how to deal with it other than running back to their parents for help. When having to actually have a job and work to get what one wants could be a problem for some. Doing community service could change that. Volunteering at a concession stand at the local sports fields and having to get what the customer orders, or working at a nursery and seeing that one has to take care of something and, also, having the urgency to take care of their needs could be an eye opener for some. That is where community service may be essential. If those reasons are not good enough then i think that the most important part is that community service makes everybody's day better. For being the person who is doing the community service to the people that get to watch, people get to see that they care and that the future is in good hands since students are the future leaders, doctors, and all of those important jobs. Community service builds character and teaches life lessons without students even realizing it. Community service makes better people. Community service is what students need to do. It should be required but not be a bad thing or another project. It should be something that people enjoy doing especially if you do it with friends. I hope that i have made it clear that community service is the way to go. Sincerely, Anonymous"
11692,0,"Imagen just looking at your computer and your computer telling your emotions. Do you think that is a good think? I believe that it is i good idea because it can help you learn something that is boring to you, help you understand what you do not know, and the computer can give you instructions on how to do your work. One reason why it is a good idea because it can help you learn something that is boring for you. The computer can help find a video or something that can help the work be for fun or extced for you. For example, say that I do not like math or i can not figure out what the answer is because i am bored the computer can find a video to help me. Another reason, is it can help you learn something you do not know. For example say the teacher does not explain a problem correctly and so the computer looks up a video or something that can explain the problem. Last reason, is the computer can give you instructions on how to do your work. For example the computer will look at your face and will see that you can not do a problem and sees your frustration and the computer will look uo an article,video,etc.. that will help you and it will give you instuctions on how to do something. In conclusion, as you can see the technology to read the emotinal expressions of student's is a great idea because it can help you something that boring to you, help you understand something that you do not know, and the computer can give you instructions on how to do your work."

23153,0,"School is a place were students are learning them self as individuals. It is a place were they can learn different cultures and get an understanding of what they like or dislike. Some students can even feel this is the only place where they get to hang out with friends. For example, school helps teens branch out of their comfort zones to become more confident and intelligent people of society. Although, the thought of staying home and not having to physically go to school sound like heaven. There can be some non-benefical and some benefical contributes to learning online at home. There can be many way of benefiting from distance learning, for instance, time management. For younger students they need to learn how to manage there time wisely. By being responsible for getting work done on time or in a timely manner, so that in the future the won't have problems with work deadlines or set appointments. Also this can benefit older students, if there is not a certain time that the students have to began their classes. An older students who may have a job that has weird work hours cold have a lesson at anytime of the day. Another thing is if there are family vacations planned or special event that are incorrelation with classes they can bring their classes with them. The next benefiting thing from distance learning is having a comfortable setting where the student can do their work. Many students learn in different ways. There are some students that like to learn by themselves and do not work well in a group setting. They may feel stressed or even just distracted by the people around them. Some people usually work alone so that they can stay focused on a task they are try ing to accomplish. Along with the benefits, there are thing that are not as benefical from distance learning. Such as the distractions that occur all around like: phones, televison, and computers. Technology is one of the biggest distractions in the world. The students would most like have the argue to be on there devices instead of doing their work. These devices well then cause them to push back the time that they will spend on their work. The students may also have household chorus they have to complete that could distract them away from their work as while. Another challenge that could happen with distance learning is there is no hands on learning. The teacher are not there to check on them and to see if they are understanding the material that is given to them. Since the student and teacher are not in the same place there could be internet problems with the connection. Some student may not have internet at all, in which could cause the student to miss important information and could end up faling behind. All of these issues could result in failing their classes. The idea of distance learning was smart in many way but could result in problems. If I were to have a choice of choosing online or in school learning I would be choose in school. This is because I am a person who like to talk to people to get a understanding of what I am learning. If I were to sit at home I know that I would get distracted and lose track of time. Being in an actual school it helps me focus on the tasks I am trying to achieve. The only time I feel that distance learning should be used is if a student is not able to mak it to classes, just so that tey can stay up to date with what is happening in class. In concluison there are many different types of students and I am sure there a many different opinions on distance learning. There are also many benefits that can prove that online at home learnig is good. People could say that it help student become more independent. While other say that it is not helping them learn at all. Thus being said the are always going to be different view on everything people do. It is up to the student and the teacher of what they feel fits their learing and teaching style."
12156,0,"Did you know on Mars there is a face? Some people think it was created by aliens. Other people think it is just a natural landform on Mars. The face on Mars was first discovered in 1976. When they first saw it it looked like a ""shadowy likeness of a human face"". It was an enormous head nearly two miles away from end to end. When they first discovered it they saw it staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. I am going to be telling you why this is just a natural landform on Mars. When scientist first saw it in 1976, they thought it was just another Martian mesa which is common around Cydonia. They knew is was some type of landform. A few days later, NASA unvieled the image for all to see. The caption was ""huge rock formation which resembles a human head"". The only reason they said it was aliens, was to get people's attention. That is exaclty what it did. Eventually on April 5,1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over to Cydonia for the first time to check it out. While they were there Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture that was ten times sharper than the original photos. When the image first apperared on a JPL web site it revealed it was just a natural landform and there was no alien monument after all. Not everyone was convinced it was just a landform. Many people still thought it had something to do with aliens. But, how could aliens have done it? No one knows. On April 8,2001 Mars Global Surveyor drew a close enough second look. ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the face in the field of view,""Garvin stated. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size"", Garvin added. ""So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" he added. They could tell there was nothing just the land its self. It could not have been aliens. What the pictures they actually took show is a Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common in the American West. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"", Garvin says. Garvin ended his statement with,""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" Coming to a conclusion, the Face on Mars is just a natural landform. Even Garvin, the Mars Global Surveyor said it himself,""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivlent of a butte or mesa, landforms common around the American West"". The Face on Mars is really, just an natural landform."
20821,0,"Dear Principle, I have been hearing a lot of talk about how you are going to change the school cell phone policy. I think that you should allow students to bring phones to school, and let them use them during lunch periods and other free times. I don't think they should be on during classes though. I also think the other kids at school will agree with this and follow the policy. Here are some reasons why I strongly think you should make this the new cell phone policy. One reason I think that the new cell phone policy should be policy one is because then kids still couldn't have their phones out in class. So i mean they aren't going to do anything bad or cheat or anything. Plus then they would be able to use their phones during passing times and at lunch, so they wouldn't feel the need to use them during classes as much. It wouldn't really be better fort eh students because if you ban phones kids are still going to bring them and use them so it is just pointless to use that policy. And that is why i think the new cell phone policy should be policy 1. Another reason I think the new cell phone policy should be policy 1 is because if you use policy 2 students are still going to bring and use their phones at school. Their parents gave them a phone for a reason... to use. So that is what they are going to do. They will just secretly use them. I know that maybe you think that it will work but it really wont if they really want to use their phones they still will. That's why i think you should use policy 1, they still wont be able to use their phones during class with that one. The last reason i think you should use policy 1 instead of policy 2 is because students would like this better. I know that! They could than communicate with their friends, their friends that don't go to the same school as them. When you were a teenager your friends are the thing that keep you going, right? Well that is how it is now, they needs to be able to talk to all their friends all the time. In class they are busy and working and doing all that boring stuff. At lunch students want to talk to all their friends and the cell phone makes it possible. That's why i think you should choose policy 1. So you can see that policy 1 would be a better fit for teenagers. I hope now you can understand that. So please pick policy 1. It would make all the students very happy! Thank you for your time!"
7769,0,"Imagine you're a middle schooler that has a lot to get done everyday and, have to take care of your sibling, maybe even take care of the house. This is the case for a lot of student's, which is why I disagree that student's should have to at least be in one extracurricular activity. A reason why I disagree that with extracurricular activities being forced is that we have a lot of homework to get done because we're beginning to take the SOL's and, we're preparing for high school next year. Another reason why I'm against student's having to take extracurricular activities unwillingly is that some student's don't enjoy any of the activities that the school has to offer, for example, I personally don't like any extracurricular actives or at least at the moment. My final reason why I believe student's shouldn't have to be forced to participate in extracurricular activities is that student's may already be in a activity that isn't school related for example, Karate or the ""SYA"". In conclusion, I disagree strongly with the decision that student should be in at least one extracurricular activity. It should be a choice if the student want's to join activity or not because in this period of time, we're very busy and have a lot of thing's going on in our life's at the moment. What would you do is this situation, would you voice your opinion and try to change the situation or would you go along with your principal's decision of making you join a extracurricular activity?"
2418,0,"Cars are used everyday to get from one place to another. In some places, people depend on cars more than others that live in different parts of the world. However, the reduction of car usage has many advantages; the planet would grealty benefit from less pollution, traffic jams would not be as frequent, and people become more healthy as a result. Limiting the use of cars would greatly help the problem of pollution in the world today. In the article written by Elisabeth Rosenthal, In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars, she describes what affects cars have on pollution, ""Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes....Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United Sates"" (Rosenthal). One can clearly see that cars are a major factor in the pollution dilemma that so many peole are trying to resolve. Everyone can take a part in the resolution of reducing pollution by depending less on cars and using other modes of transport such as public transportation, biking, or even walking. Some cities are placing enforcements to ban the usage of cars. Paris is an example of one of these locations. The result of the enforcemnt was that congestion (or smog) went down 60 percent. This is a great improvemnt for the city, which is known for having near-record pollution. Multiplying these enforcemnts to other cities would definitely bring down a large percent of the pollution found on Earth. This is benefiting not only the planet, but also the population that lives on the planet by enabling them to breathe healthier air. The cause of traffic jams is the abundant amount of cars on the road, which could be avoided if less cars were used. Andrew Selsky wrote in his article, Care-free Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota, ""In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a care-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams"" (Selsky). With no cars to clog the streets, a relaxed sentiment took the place of a usually anxious and hurried feeling. Rush-hour restrictions were put in act, and have drastically cut traffic. Less honking takes place, and more time is saved in order to get to one's destination. Cars are not always needed to get someone where they want to go, and the enviornment is less stressul without all of the congestion of cars on the road. People become more healthy when car usage is limited. Instead of taking a car to get from point A to point B, some people are walking or biking instead. This is a huge benefit to the people that are exercising. Also, in Care-free Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota, it says that parks and sports centers have bloomed throuhout the city of Bogota because of the decreased usage of automobiles. The parks and sport centers help people stay active and healthy. Although cars are useful in order to get to one's destination, there are many advantages to cutting back the usage of them. A huge advantage is that pollution would drastically go down. Another is the time and stress saved from less traffic jams. Lastly, people would benefit from the way they are making their lives more healthy."
25580,0,"Do you have a friend that asks questions to about five people and you are wondering why isn he asking just one. If so then these few paragraphs might explain why or most likely reasons why your friend is so interested in multiple peoples opinions. These people could be right to ask so many people because he could want to hear other peoples opinions, he could want to see which one is false and see if both of them certainly agree on one response or he could need help with certain subjects and all of the people specialize in different subjects. Let us say we have a friend named Generic_Name and he needs support to see which doctor he should go to to get his legs fixed. He could ask one or ask a bunch of friends because they have more experience with those doctors than he does. If they argue that means they are settling their differences like a rainstorm it gets bumpy in the middle but after there is a rainbow. Should Generic_Name pit his friends against another the answer is yes so that you can have a agreed solution. If his friends cannot decide he will go to a unknown doctor so he can recommend his friends not to go or to go to that doctor. Now Generic_Name is the son of Generic_Name and he needs help on his homework that combines science and math. His dad is great at math but terrible at science while his uncle is great at science but bad at math he could ask one or he could ask them all. He could ask his teachers to help him with his dad and uncle so they can come to an agreement and then tell the others what they think the answer is. There is also a mix between Science and History like the big bang theory or Alexander Grambell where he used waves to send messages. There are mixes between subjects and just on person that is good at one could not be good enough for this two subject question. Generic_Name is the son of Generic_Name now and he wants to make sure that his classwork is good he could ask the teacher or get eight people. Then once gathered they will discuss their answers and theories that they have discussed until they see an error. People make mistakes all the time and that is why we are humans we make errors and then settle our differences. Although it is not appropriate to do that in school or in a test but if it supposed to be in a group then I recommend you get in the group. Most jobs would like you to be correct so going around coworkers dorms and asking this is OK so you can be sure that is correct. It is OK to ask for multiple people at a time if it is not a ridiculous question that a first grader can do alone without a doubt. Although if it is a question you are stump on then that is OK just remember the more the merrier so do it with a group. There are also focus groups and juries that have to settle their differences and make it a anonymous decision."
4849,0,"Summer projects should be student-designed because this is their time to relax. Students should not have to go through more school work during their time off. How would you feel if you get worked handed to you on your day off? Students should be able to design their projects because this is a students personal time, some students learn different from others, and students should be able to do a project that they enjoy. To start off, this is a students personal time. Most students would not want to have work handed to them during the summer because they have been in school for ten months. Students should feel as if this is their time to relax and do whatever it is that they like. If they have to do a project, it should be something that they want to do instead of what the teacher wants them to do. For example, back in elementary school my teacher gave us a reading project to do over the break. It was a book that I hated and I thought, ""Who even likes to read, let alone over break."" I was so made that we have to do this project, but if it had been a book that i actually wanted to read, I would have been more likely to do the project. Secondly, some students learn in different ways than others. Not every single person learns the same as the next. Everyone is either an auditory, a visual, or a hands-on learner. Many people could prefer something totally different from you, so a teacher just handing a student a project and telling them to do it, will not help them to learn. For instance, I am a visual and hands-on learner, but the person next to me could be an auditory learner. Lastly, students should be able to do a project that they enjoy. If students are given a project that they do not want to do or are at least interested in, the chances of them doing it are low. They don't even want to have work over the break, but if they are given something that they are interested in, they will most likely do it. Some will think agree with my claim, others will disagree. The ones that disagree will probably say that teachers should design the projects. They may say that the teacher knows what is best for their students and that if the students have some authority over their project, they will do or pick something that does nothing for their knowledge and education. They may also say that they need to learn that not everything can got their way in life and they have to deal with what is front of them. I say that we give students the opportunity to be students and live their life as teens as much as they possibly can before they jump right into the real world. I believe that students should design their projects, but the teachers should approve. Compromising is a key factor in this. If people want the students to not have so much control over a project for school, teachers should be more open minded and be able to at least give their students a choice of enjoyable projects for the students to work on over break. Even then, students still have some sort of choice of what they find pleasurable to work on over their free time and still end up getting a grade for the work that they have completed. In conclusion, students should be able to design their project over the break because it is their personal time, some students learn different from others, and students should be able to do a project that they enjoy. Students are maturing as the days go by. If we don't give them some sort of authority as they grow up, they will not develop into adults that can handle the real world. Letting them have some sort of freedom or choice over what they want to do, will benefit them in the long run and not let them grow up so fast. Looking at this from a students point of view will give you an open mind about my position on this topic. Students should be able to feel a since of freedom when it comes tho their break and not feel stressed or pressured to do more school work during their time off."
981,0,"Cell Phones & Driving Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc. Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time. Unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones: while they are driving. As a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones. Using a handheld cell phone while driving is dangerous to the driver themselves for a couple of good reasons. One such reason is that. When driving, sometimes it is difficult to focus on the road which makes it easy to forget that the roads are shared by everyone and not for your exclusive use. Other drivers on the road take notice of drivers on their cell phones whether they want to or not because of the hazards they create. Erratic driving is something that we all get quite worked up about, especially if it makes us late or is otherwise a direct inconvenience to us. Scott Stone, veteran web business strategist and the owner of the consultancy Jimmy, says He came within inches of a bad accident because of a young driver being on the phone and crossing three lanes of traffic at 45 mph. Drivers are also tailgating you because of, again, the inability to maintain a constant speed because they are on the phone. Clark warns of the rusty red Camaro tailgating the minivan full of kids. Drivers who use cell phones while driving are also highly dangerous to pedestrians. A young woman killed a pedestrian on a bicycle while she was texting on her phone. She may not have intended to end that person's life, but she made the poor decision to drive and text which she has to live with for the rest of her life. Any one of us could have been that poor individual on that fateful day. I used to ride my bike everywhere, mostly using the roads in the way that bikes are supposed to. That just proves that point that everybody 60 percent of teens admitted to risky driving. Nearly half of those drivers admitted to text messaging while driving. In April, 2009, in Houston Texas five children lost their lives when the car they were in lost control and slid into a rain swollen ditch. The driver lost control of the vehicle when he went to answer his ringing cell phone. The car went into the ditch and was swept 100 feet down the raging current. The rescue team was unable to reach the car with the trapped passenger. Two adults and one ten year old girl were able to escape, but five children under the age of seven all passed away. A 17 year old girl was driving in Jacksonville Florida. She said that she glanced down at her cell phone"" when she struck a 44 year old man. He was working on side of the road with his tree trimming crew when he was struck by the distracted driver."
7473,0,"Personally, I've always enjoyed participating in clubs. Which is why I believe that if the principal were to decide that everyone had to be in a club, I wouldn't be opposed. I think that having students participate in extracurricular activities is good because they can improve teamwork and relationships, they are something colleges look for, and they can help relieve the stress of school. First off, they can help with relationships and teamwork. Doing an extracurricular where you frequently work with others can help to improve social skills and teamwork strategies. This will definitely help you in your older years, especially if you're going into a field where you need to be able to communicate with people. Communication and collaboration are things I've gotten much better at since I started joining clubs. You can also meet and connect with new people. I've met some of my closest friends in clubs. Secondly, they're something that colleges look for. Colleges tend to seek people with some experience, and clubs can help you gain that. Picking clubs that lean more towards the major you want in college can be helpful. Certain extracurricular activities are more desired than others, but any clubs will help your application look more desirable. The National (Junior) Honor Society is an example of a club that lots of people apply to because it looks nice on applications. Lastly, clubs can help relieve the stress of school. School can be incredibly exhausting at times. That's why some people sign up for after-school activities. They can be an escape from day-to-day life. These activities let us do something we enjoy that we might not be able to do during school. On days when the clubs I am in meet, I look forward to it the entire day. I have had friends say similar things, such as ""I can't wait for rehearsal!"" or ""Track is something I'm really looking forward to this year!"" If one day the intercom were to turn on and our principal would say ""Every student is expected to join one of our extracurricular activities,"" I wouldn't be upset. I believe that this is a decent idea because clubs can improve relationships and teamwork, they are something colleges look for, and they can relieve the stress of school."

These people helped with cattle and other animals that were shipped to Europe to help them. People were asked to help by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, or UNRRA. People should join the Seagoing Cowboys progam because, you get to help other countries and people, you get to see many parts of the world, and you have fun. If you are in the Seagoing Cowboys progam, you can help other countries by giving them animals for food and work. It makes you feel good about yourself. The article says, "" It made me more aware other countries and their needs."" That would make someone feel good about themselves for helping other countries. Wouldn't that make you feel good? In the Seagoing Cowboys program, you can see many parts of the world depending on where you are going. You could see Italy and other countries. The article states, ""Besides helping people, I had the benefit of seeing Europe and China."" That would be very exciting. How would you like to see a bunch of different countries while working? You wouldn't have to pay for travel While working for this program, you would also have fun. The people aboard the ship would play games on the way back to get more animals. The cowboys would also play baseball and other games in empty ship holds where the animals were on the way there. Also the article even states that they played games. Even though you are working, you will still have fun. So, if you are in the Seagoing Cowboys program, you will have fun, you will feel good about yourself, and you will also get to tour and visit many different parts of the world. Many people helped with the Seagoing Cowboys program. They helped many countries in Europe. The cowboys still got to do what they always did, help with animals. So, do you think that you would want to become a Seagoing Cowboy? Or at least be in the program."

Vauban, Germany- residents of this community have gone to where few people would ever dare to enter; a car free suburban area. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother said ""When I had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Living without a car can open up your eyes to the world like never before. You can bike ride on trails and paths to explore your city or suburb, just look at Columbia. They've also made changes to having no cars in their lives. They participate in their own car-free day. This day has now seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin America city. Being car-free for Columbia also means rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic, and new resturants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. Furthermore, limitations on cars should be reduced because of the amount of greenhouse gases they cause which depletes our ozone layer and pollutes our air that we breath. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of emissions of greenhouse gases in Europe, and about 50 percent is areas that cars are frequently used in the United States. But its not just the US, even in France car emissions are polluting the air. Paris, had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared to 114 in brussels and 79.7 in London. The main reason banned driving was because of the near-record pollution in the air. The smog was so bad that is rivaled with Beijing and China which are known as the most polluted cities in the world."
20911,0,"Dear Principal, I think the policy in which cell phones are allowed during free time is better than no cell phones at all. Even if you banned cell phones it wouldn't stop kids from bringing them to school. Kids like to keep in touch, which is why they have cell phones. Since they can't talk in class texting is more sneaky than writhing paper notes and throwing them around the classroom where the teachers are watching. Its also a good time to call parents in free time if they are staying after school of they are riding home with a friend's parent. It feels less tense than asking a teacher to use your cell phone or using the school's phone. If kids are allowed to have their cell phones during free time there may be a chance they won't use their cell phone in class in return. Besides, if they aren't allowed to use their cell phones in school there is a chance they would use it in class and look cool doing it. It would just get other people trying to do it too. And if you are going to let cell phones in school, you have to enforce the rules better than with the 'no cell phones' rule. Give a big consequence if they decide to go against the rules, Like a lunch or an after school detention. Or maybe get their cell phone taken away and they can only get it back after class or school. Also you could probably send it to you, the principal's office where the can get it after school or by rules have a parent pick up the phone. If you enforce this rule you could make all the students sign a contract that they will only use their cell phones during lunch or free time or else they may have to face consequences such as the ones mentioned before. Tell them that this is not a freedom but a privilege. I think you should allow cell phones to be in school but just at lunch or a free time. That way everyone gets what they want. Kids actually get the opportunity to actually use cell phones at school. If kids get more freedom, so do you. I think you will be very surprised how many students will agree and respect this rule. Kids want to use their cell phones so I'm pretty sure no one will be breaking this policy. You, the principal can be rest assured that kids are using their cell phones at a free time but not in class. And if there were anything to happen with this rule you can always have the right to remove this rule and ban cell phones in school once and for all. Thank you, STUDENT_NAME"
10029,0,"Yes, I belive that we should use technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. It seems like a good result to add to schools. Even more other than just schools people jobs and different areas. My reason for saying why we should use technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom because in the text it says in pragher 6 '' A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored,''.'' Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. By saying in other worlds when u get confused or bored the computer can try different things like make the lesson a little better and fun and slow it down for you and try different ways to keep u on track and in gagens. Other reason why we should have technology to read the emoitional expressions of students in a classroom is because it even helps when students come to school upset and in a bad mood it qoutes in the texts about that saying ''By weightiong the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions(as in da Vinci's masterpiece).'' also it says in the text ''Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion).'' Saying it can help you in all type of different ways far as when u are in your moods. To finsh it up about why we should use this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is because it wont to keep people up and understand whats going on and not confused or bored. Trying to keep people montived and trying to teach different ways of teaching when en the lesson get hard or not fun and the teacher do not know everything so this technology can even help the teacher out with the students."
22019,0,"I think that they should let us bring cell phones to school if it is off during class. We can use it during lunch and recess. It would be better for us with out interrupting class because, they go off in class. People love to talk, text, and get on the internet. They can do all that on their phones and it will also pass the time. We don't always go to recess because, they can only dismiss so many students to the gym when it is raining outside. When we are in for recess we can use our cell phones to do things. We may even need to use it for an emergency. Now that i got the positive out of the way lets think about the negative. Students may forget to turn off their phones and may interrupt class. Their phone could get lost or stolen. They could get grounded for loosing their phone. They could be texting in class and get their phone taken away and make their parent come and pick it up. All these things don't happen very often though. Now that we have seen the positives and the negatives there are more positives than negatives. There are several good things and very few bad things. So there should be phones in school. I'm pretty sure your see the point, it is very easy to see. Now the principal decides on the rule."
15746,0,"If the principal wants to change the school policy by saying that in order to participate in sports, you need to have B average. For this, argument I would say would be weird because most kids in our school try to get good grades, but its really hard for them to do it. The three things that I will talk about is obesity, having fun, and how it would be good/bad in our school if he/she did taking away activities. If the principal would take away activities, how would we change the obesity rate in this country. Our obesity rate is getting bigger because kids don't do activities as much as they did back then, and today people are always dyeing from obesity. Many people are trying to lose the weight by having to jog or us kids joining an after school activities. Parents always would let there kids sign up for activities so they can make new friends. BOOM,RUN, KICK,SCORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's the good game of soccer and people having fun and well the old American tradition. Mostly people always do activities and always having fun and that's the whole point of it. Many people in different countries don't have the experience we do. Plus we shouldn't just toss it away like that. Many people in Africa don't even of a ball to play anything and we have that great opportunity to do that. It would be a good thing for kids to have no activities and to do it on there own time, but it would be really something if kids don't have the time and money to play any activities so they don't do it after all. Some of the reasons it would be a bad thing is that kids would be obesied and kids wouldn't make new friends at all My argument is that the principal should leave the activities and we will try our best to do what we can and those three topics that I stated are my reasons why we should have activities,and let us kids have something we can do to HAVE FUN!!!!!!!!!"
922,0,"Teen Driving Without Cell Phones Everyday people die in car accidents, because they use their cell phones while driving. According to research, cell phones are leading factors to most car accidents. Despite danger, people still use cell phones because they want to keep in touch with other people. Moreover, people use arguments that phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although, some people support using cell phone while driving, evidence have shown that people should avoid talking while driving. Opponents whose work depend on cell phones such as lawyers, always have to be able to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, they can create dangerous situations like a collision or accident. Business issues can be dangerous while driving, because emotional reactions can end in a tragedy. The conversation that the driver is having might upset them, and lower their ability to drive, this can lead to an accident. So if people don't decide to put their cell phones away, they could take a lot of innocent lives. Some people predict that hand-free set is safe because people can drive using two hands. Although, hand-free devices don't eliminate accidents it worsen it by suggesting this gesture is safe. Even headsets can be unsafe because it can distract the driver from the road. When the car swerves unexpectedly or a pedestrian is in the road, the mind lacks the amount of react time need to prevent an accident from happening. So the problem isn't holding the steering wheel and cell phone at the same time, but it's just the simple fact that the conversation and lack of reaction at that moment. People argue cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency. When you need your cell phone the most it's hard to find because they are stuck in the car. Drivers around the world shouldn't full depend on their cell phones, because if the car accident is terrible a cell phone wouldn't help at that moment. OnStar is a service that deal with in-vehicle security and emergency problems. Therefore, cell phones are unnecessary while driving. Concluding, if people don't give up cell phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase. Its people responsibility to not their own and others people lives at risk. No matter how right you think it is, it's a state law to not use cell phones while driving. Don't be a selfish driver on the road.

20348,0,"The president of the united states is one of the most powerful political leaders in the world and controls the faith of one of the wealthiest countrys on the planet. There have been many discussions on how to elect the president of such a great nation. The Electoral College, the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. If its worked for over 200 years why change it. The Electoral College provides certainty of outcome and avoids run-off elections and should be kept as the form of election of the U.S. president of our state. To Begin With, the Electoral College has been used for more than 200 years and our state is fighting for another 200 years of electoral college. In an article by Richard A. Posner called ""In Defense Of The Electoral College:Five Reasons To Keep Our Despised Method Of ChoosingThe President"" he states ""there are...reasons for retainig the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree: all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons."" Amongst these reasons one of them is the certainty of outcome and in source 3 paragraph 18 it states that ""A dispue over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible-it happened in 2000-but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reasons is that the winning candidates share of the popular vote."" Richard Posner is stating that Electoral College is more effective because it causes less trouble and does not need to be disputed unlike popular vote which needs to be disputed because the winning candidiates share of the Electoral college invaribly exceeds his share of the popular vote. Furthermore, The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. In an article by Richard A. Posner called ""In Defense Of The Electoral College:Five Reasons To Keep Our Despised Method Of ChoosingThe President"" he says ""nixon in 1968 and clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370). There is pressure for run off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; the presidential election process, is reduced by the electoral college, which invaribly produces a clear winner."""
6299,0,"Extracurricular activities are exhilarating in a variety of different ways. Extracurriculars can also be very helpful in the future. Getting involved in an extracurricular activity is a phenomenal way to make new friends, and obtain special skills. Being apart of an after school activity can help people make new friends. People that are participating in the same club or sport have one common interest. For example, my friend is in the Photography Club, and she has met some people that also enjoy taking candid photographs just like she does. My brother is also in the Drama Club at Generic_School all the people in the Drama Club with my brother have the same passion for acting as my brother does. Being on a sports team can help when you trust the other people on the team. When students are on sports teams coaches like to play icebreaker games to help everyone on the team get to know each other, and to trust each other. If and when every team member trusts everyone on the team they can start playing like a team. In school students sometimes pretend to be someone they aren't, but when they are at their club or at sports practice they become their true selves. Students are afraid to be who they really are because they think if they show others the real them then they won't be liked. Though when their in a club or on a team they begin to feel less afraid and are more comfortable with their peers. These are the reasons why I think joining an extracurricular activity would help students make friends. Participating in an after school activity can help people attain special skills. Being on a sports team requires having an enormous amount of stamina and effort. For instance, when boys join the football team they have to work really hard to build up their stamina to run really far, and to block the opposing team from scoring. They also have to practice, and if they actually want to have a chance of winning they need to put in a tremendous amount of effort while in practice to do so. Someone on the football team with a little practice can gain the skill of building up a gigantic amount of stamina and, they can learn to put as much effort as they can into everything they do. If people join a club they can learn leadership skills and learn to be more confident. An example of this is if someone joined the school newspaper, and they were named head editor they would have to give people articles to write, and would edit and go over people's work with them. The editor would learn how to lead their peers to victory with the printing of the finalized copy of the school paper. Also, if a person joined the debate team they would learn to speak clearer, and with more confident. Another skill that people can learn if they join a club is learning to be patient. When I was in 7th grade I was in a club called best buddies, and in this club I was helping disabled kids with little projects and things that were difficult for them. Working with them taught me that I need to be more patient with people because someone never knows what another person is going thorough. This is why participating in an extracurricular activity will help you learn special skills. Joining after school activities is a outstanding way to establish friendships,and learn impressive skills. Students will never know what to expect when it come to after school activities. But it is always an adventure."
4806,0,"Summer break is meant for fun and time with family and friends, but students don't really notice that they are losing the skills and knowledge they've collected. They really only care about having fun, not learning. Students always look forward to summer break, but tend to slowly lose some of the knowledge that they've retained throughout the school year. This results in not being prepared for the up and coming school year. Students come in confused and unprepared causing them to fall behind. Imagine coming to school on the very first day and having a hard time remembering certain topics. You're ability to understand your favorite subject has slowly slipped away and the teacher is moving on to more complicated topics. This sets you back and makes it harder for you to understand the new topics being taught. If most or all of the class is confused and having a hard time, some teachers are forced to push back lessons in order to insure that everyone is caught up, while others may just move on creating further confusion. It puts teachers at an ultimatum; Should he/she risk the completion of their curriculum for the new year to help the students who couldn't retain the previous knowledge, or move on knowing that these people may not pass their class? Teachers have found a way to solve this annual issue without having to reintroduce a topic to the class. They have created summer projects. These projects usually have something to do with the new curriculum for the new school year. Whether it's a reading assignment, essay, or even a vocabulary assignment, it is all meant to prepare the students and get them thinking early. A discussion was set in motion on the topic of: Should summer projects be student-designed or teacher-designed? Summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers know what skills all of their students need in their classroom in order to succeed and carry on with the rest of the year without any set-backs or complications. When designing project assignments, teachers make sure that this project will develop a better understanding of a topic in the student's mind. They base it off of what skills these students need to acquire and improve their class's ability to comprehend the topic. For example, a student wouldn't know how to create a project for algebra 2 if they had just completed geometry and have no background knowldge of algebra 2. They would need a teacher's guidance and detailed directions to complete this project. This also creates a level of understanding for the student coming into the class. During the summer, students lose thought of these topics, but if teachers created projects for them during this time, they would come in fully prepared. Everyone would have an equal level of understanding because they all are prepared for the same thing. Equal opportunity is very important in a classroom because every student needs to feel like they can comprehend what they are learning in order to succeed. If students go out on their own and design their own project, they may not feel pushed to try their hardest. A teacher creates equal opportunity by creating the same guidelines for all of the students. Teachers also have experience with students in the past and know what topic to hit the hardest based on past experiences. They will design these projects to push the class to their highest potential and make sure that each student is taken care of. Student-designed projects wouldn't be a smart idea because kids tend to do the bare minimum. If students design their own project, they wont know what topics to understand or why they are studying a certain topic. this leads to an unequal understanding of a topic which doesnt help students in the future. They might just do a little assignment that doesnt require much work or effort that doesnt challenge them just to enjoy their summer a little more. yes, some students work hard, but they all come in not knowing what exactly this new year is going to bring. Students should have the right to think on their own and create new ideas, but this should be further down the school year once the teacher is certain they understand what they are learning. For example, in my English class, our teacher made us all read and annotate the same book. once we came to class she gave us a vague writing prompt asking what the argument was in the story. Because we have all read he book and annotated it how she wanted, we were all able to write this essay and understand it. Some may argue that a student needs the freedom to learn on their own, but also need to consider the fact that not every student wants to try as hard or even challenge themselves. This is why students need a guide to show them the way in order to create a better understanding. it's a basic understanding that in order to succeed and be independent, one needs to have grasped some knowledge and relied on a teacher to have given the knowledge. This is why there are teachers in the world. they are here to be there for someone and be there as their guide because they know what is best for them in education. To conclude this argument, teacher-based summer projects are the best way to insure a student's ability to succeed in their class. It takes out the factor of inequlity and allows the student to hold onto previous and future knowledge. This helps them undertsand what they are learning in class and reduces the risk of getting left behind. Teachers are here to guide their students to success and cannot do so if their students are lost and getting left behind. If it were student-designed, they would be least likely to push themselves to their greatest potential. They also wouldn't know what to study. These points should be cosidered in the topic discussing whether or not teacher-designed or student-designed is the best possible option for a student."

Driverless cars are cheaper than the cars of modern society. The cofounder of Google, Sergey Brin, imagines a future in which driverless cars replace today's taxi system. Brin forsees driverless cars that ""would use half the fuel of today's taxis."" Brin also envisions that the driverless cars would provide ""far more flexibility than a bus.""

These driverless cars of the future would be a safer option in adition to being cheaper. The driverless cars have sensors all around the car, including the roof, the rear wheels, ""a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reciever, and an inertial motion sensor."" These sensors provide angles and points of view that the driver can not see. The sensors created using modern technology ""ha[ve] become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers."" With these new sensors that will just continue to become more advanced, less accidents will happen on the road.

Although one would think that driverless cars that would still require a driver may become ""bored waiting for their turn to drive,"" Dr. Werner Huber has come up with a solution. Dr. Werner Huber, who is a project manager at BMW, has come up with a way ""to interpret the driving fun in a new way."" Driverless cars could provide entertain for not only the driver, but the whole family. Movies could display and the front overhead and then simply go out of view when the driver needs tend to the road. ""The in-car system is actually a safety feature"" and can be more safe than ""drivers trying to text with a cell phone."" Cars that do not require a driver are the future of today's society. These cars of the future give a cheaper, safer, and more enertaining alternative to the regular driving of the 21st century.

22224,0,"January 25, 2011 Dear TEACHER_NAME, My name is STUDENT_NAME. I am writing you this letter because I think that you should really consider policy 2. If you consider policy 2 i guarantee that you would make the school a little safer. Three reasons i think this is one there would be less traffic in the hallways; two its easier to learn without a distraction,and three it doesn't cause any problems. It would cause less traffic in the hallways than if you were aloud to use phones. If you were aloud to use phones then students would take advantage of this they would think that the hallway is considered their free time. this would cause a lot of chaos. Many kids would get hurt because they would not be watching where they are going. This is very unsafe. Another reason that policy 2 is better is because policy one would make it difficult for some students to learn. If kids had it out in their free time it could just be when they are done with their work, but some kids could still be working. this would cause a distraction. Also if somebody has their phone out when the teacher is trying to teach students would be focussed on them not the teacher. Then students wouldn't learn anything,and isn't that the whole purpose of school is to learn something. My final reason that you should have no cell phones at school is because it doesn't cause any problems. It helps more than it hurts not having cell phones at school. Without cell phones you don't have that many distractions. Not everyone is worried about who's texting who. Also kids can't record fights and post them. If you pick policy 2 you shall see that it will pay off. These are just three reasons to pick policy 2. Thank you for taking your time to read this letter. please consider my opinion. sincerely, STUDENT_NAME"

You can also tell if the student is bored or depressed so the you can do something about that. like it was said in the article about Making Mona Lisa Smile.

And all they have to do is use this technolghy to see wether you are really liking something or wether you are really hating something. not only that it also see that if you are making more than one expression in your image. In conclusion, i say that this techology is nit just good in all schools around the world but good to use in everyones daily lifes and can be used to help people in hospitals and all over the world, it can be used to stop crin=mes and used to see wether someone is lieing or not. or to even indicate what the person is probably thinking or planning to do."
14387,0,"Dear TEACHER_NAME and TEACHER_NAME, I know that you are debating whether students should be required to perform community service. In my opinion, you shouldn't. Students enjoy having time on weekends to see friends, go shopping, and visit with family. If you required them to do community service they wouldn't be allowed to do these things. Also, if students had to do community service after school they would have limited time to do homework and study. Their grades would probably drop. Now don't get me wrong, I think community service is a great idea. It's a wonderful time to help out, volunteer time, and donate. Although, I don't think many students would be too happy if they were forced to do this. Most schools have Honor Clubs with students with exceptional grades and characteristics. These students volunteer their time and as a reward they get to go on field trips to amusement parks and other fun places. These are the students who should be helping out in our community. They get to volunteer if they want to and if they don't, it's their loss. I am one of these people and I think helping out in my community is really fun and fulfilling. Instead of making community service a requirement, you should create a club with rewards and fun projects that have to do with helping out. I think it would really be worth the time and effort. Why, you might even find your community becoming a better place! Thanks so much for you time and understanding. I hope you consider my idea. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME, student of SCHOOL_NAME."
6995,0,"Students should not have to participate in extracurricular activities if they do not want to. They might not find sports, yearbooks, and student council fun. They could be playing sports outside of school and can't play on the school team or do other activities outside of school. What time frame would these activities start and end, some students might not be able to make it to those activities. If these activities start early some students might not have enough energy or be to tired to do these activities. Some students might not be able to make it to these activities or be to tired from school and just want to go home. If students do not like these activities schools should have more options such as after school clubs, music, art. Students should also suggest ideas that they think is fun and would like to do. Students should have to sign up for these activities only if they know they will do them and have enough energy. The schools should also inform the students parents/guardians that they will be doing this activity. They should also send an email about what time the student should get picked up. Some students may not want to do a sport because they might get bullied if they are not good enough for that team. Students may also feel bad about themselves if they make a bad play, pass, or shot. Students should have to tryout for sports and should report any bullying if they do not make the team. Other students should also not be rude to others who dont make the team either. Students should also play other sports outside of school if they do not make a team. Students should not have to make year books because they can see others picture early and they could make fun of someone for having a bad picture in the year book. Some students also might find it boring and skip it. If students do this it should be during their flex or free time in school. Working on a year book might interfere with student's classes and they would have to do make up work if they are missing parts of a class. So instead students should just not do this and let teachers work on yearbooks. So students should suggest ideas to teachers or their principle. Students should not bully others if they do not make a school team. Students should do other sports outside of school if they do not make a sports team. Teachers and staff should make year books. Students should also not have to participate in extracurricular activities if they do not want to."

Also another thing is the picture actually shows that it is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa that are landforms common around the American West. Another reason it could have looked like a face is the took a picture of the Face on Mars and its located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998. Witch means the camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Witch could have messed up the picture. The new picture was taken on Nevertheless April 8, 2001a cloudless summer day in CydoniaMars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look at the face. They had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. Malins team captured an extraordinary photo using the cameras absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. Before they got that picture they had to do alot of hard work. Heres what the did, Mission controllers prepared to look again. they said Its not easy to target Cydonia. In fact, its hard work. Mars Global Surveyor is a mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the planet like a fax machine in narrow 2.5 km-wide strips. They just dont pass over the Face very often. The first time they took the pickture it wasnt that good of a picture. This is what happened before they got the good photo. On April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing. a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. It was a better photo then the first one taken by the viking but it had a glare and wasn't as good as the second one. This is why the face isn't an alien artifact, and it is also why it is not being looked at alot and observed. The Face is just a natural landform on mars that is sorta like a butte or mesalandform found around the American West. It alo kinda looks like the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The Middle Butte a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. Thats why Its not Alien it is just a natural land form."
6582,0,"Should students be forced to take an extracurricular activity? I don't take they should for many reasons. Taking extracurricular activities can increase work and responsibility, take time away from more important areas, or even cause stress. A student should only take an extracurricular activity if they know that they'll enjoy it. Otherwise, it can negatively affect the student in many ways. Taking an extracurricular activity means more work, and considering the amount of work students already have, it can be overwhelming. Many students won't be able to complete all their assignments because of the extra activity. This can lead to lower grades and worst performance in other classes. Not only will students have more work, they will also have to manage their time in order to be able to consistently participate or show up for that activity. You might be thinking that time management is a good skill to practice, in which you're not wrong, but it can also mean taking time away from other things in order to include something else. When students take extracurricular activities, they take away from their free time in order to put it in their schedule. Students use their free time to do their homework, relax from work, or spend with their family. This is pretty important for a student, considering that this may stress them out. This leads into our final reason. The increased amount of work and responsibility, combined with managing time efficiently, can be enough to overwhelm student to the point where they get stressed. Students might not be able to keep up with all the work they get from their extracurricular activity plus all their other classes. As stated before, this can lower grades, and force students to take time away from those classes just to focus on their extracurricular activity. Stress is very serious problem already, and it can be beneficial not to force a student to participate in an activity that they don't want to do. In conclusion, taking an extracurricular activity can have negative affects. It starts with unnecessary work, which leads to taking time away from other things, which finally leads to stress. Many students already do extracurricular activities, mainly because they enjoy it. But some students need time to focus on other things they might find more important, which isn't a bad thing. Students shouldn't be forced to join an activity, but they should always have the option to."
7019,0,"According to Dr. Maxwell Olchena, a psychologist who studies the effects of marching band on adolescents' brains, participating in marching band can do one of two things depending on your personality, just wait until you see what his studies have proven! I think it's very important to do an extra curricular activity, but I do not believe it should be required, as we just do not have enough options for extra circulars to fit every student's desires. Some extra circulars, such as marching band, are not for the light of heart and truly are scary at points(especially drum line but we'll get into that later.) This is why students should do extra circulars, but it should not be a requirement. Dr. Maxwell Olchena is a psychologist who has been studying the effects of marching band on adolescents' brains for almost 20 years, here's what his studies have shown: there are two things marching band can do to the brain of an adolescent, and however they are affected depends on their personality and nothing to do with IQ(Intelligence quota). Those with higher IQs tend to perform better in marching band, although marching band does not require you perform well(as hard work brings good performance.) The two things that can happen to the brain of an adolescent when they join marching band are, increased mood and productiveness, or decreased mood and productiveness, thats right. Marching band can do two polar opposite things to the adolescent brain. Dr. Olchena's studies have shown that when someone considered an extrovert joins marching band, their mood will decrease and they will become burnt out, this is because they aren't used to the amount of work put into their social life. Marching band is less a sport and more of a social activity, unless you are willing to accept it as your only family, you will not be happy and become very burnt out. Here's where Olchena's studies get crazy, introverts are more likely to have increased moods and increased productiveness when joining marching band. Olchena's studies have also shown that when and introvert joins marching band, they become more social, and those around them report and increase in socializing. Now here's where this relates to every extra curricular, Olchena had his friend, and fellow psychologist, Dr. Alan Russell study this in his area of study, debate team, and the exact opposite is true for this extra curricular. Introverts tend to lose productiveness and have a decrease in happiness, whereas extroverts tend to have increased productiveness and mood. Drum line, however, is where the studies get interesting. Dr. Brock Hayman, an expert in the effects of drum line on the adolescent brain, has discovered a new area of the brain that awakens the second you join drum line. This area is called the Drumbolow Cortex. When activated, this area of the brain never turns off. The Drumbolow Cortex does some weird things to the brain once activated, it can cause the person to do crazy things, such as picking up gum on the ground of the parking lot at band camp(This has actually happened before.) Other signs that this area has been activated are: inability to stop drumming, addiction to buying drumsticks, need to move up rankings in drumlins, and recruiting more people for the drum line. studies show that 90% of people do not even have this area in their brain, and fewer than 5% of the population has it activated. These are all good reasons why you should join an extracurricular(*cough cough drum line cough cough*,) so why shouldn't it be a requirement? Dr. Brett Staudt, a psychologist who studies the effects of marching band on people's actions around family members, has the answer to your question. ""Those who chose to join marching band will become a disturbance to their family, they will become obsessed with showing their family shows by Drum Corps International, such as the Cavaliers 2011 show in which the drums are upside down. Most of the population does not care whatsoever about how amazingly cool it is to drum upside down, but any person who chooses to join marching band, even if they don't do drum line, will become obsessed with the fact that people have enough skill to play the tenors upside down."" This quote says two things, you should watch the Cavaliers 2011 show, and also that marching band has negative effects on the life of family members of the person who chooses this curse/blessing of an activity, not to mention, you'll never see that person again because they'll always be at practice or hanging out with their marching band friends. Although I do believe it is a good idea to do an extra curricular, Dr. Nathan Strain has done countless studies on forcing adolescents to partake in things, and it causes them to be less interested in what they're doing. I would rather not have people in marching band who are there only because they've been forced to be there, as they will not work as hard because all they care about is the fact that they have to do it. When students have free will and the ability to make their own decision, they will choose what they feel is best for them self and we should let them do whatever they believe is best for their situation in life at the moment. You never know what else a student has to do at home just to have enough money for food, or to pay for other expenses. What I take away from this evidence is that we should not force students to participate in extra curricular, but rather encourage them to do so. Personally, joining drum line was the best choice(I'm kidding it was a mistake but I'm glad I made it) I've ever made and I will continue doing drum line for the rest of my high school and college career, although had I been forced, I'm not sure if I'd be as happy to be in it. I genuinely think forcing students to do anything will cause burnout and decrease happiness. I truly think students should make their own decision on if an extra curricular fits in their life or not."
10385,0,"This system could be very benificial in classrooms for many reasons. One reason being this system can literally tell what all of your emotions are an what percent each of them are. How a student feel about school or a class can effect how they do in school or the class big time. If a student hates the class and dreads going there every single day then that will effect how they do in the class and usaully for the worse, this does not mean they will fail the class but alot of the time there grade will not be as good as it should be. If a student loves the class and loves going to school then obviously they will be more ingaged and do better in the class most of the time. Schools could use this system to see what they could change in the school to make kids enjoy class and school more. Them doing this would hopefully improve grades and attitudes toward school which could always lead to more students wanting to go to college. There are alot of long term very benifical plans that could come with this."
10679,0,"In the article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile,'' the author describes how a new technology called the facial Action coding system enables compututers to identify human emotions. I feel this technology can be useful but weird,Because it can help peopel be able to want to learn,but make you like the computer is watching 24/7. An example on how it can help is an paragraph 5-9. Paragraph 5 gives us facts and why we should use the computer. Paragraph 6 says the computer will bring you a smile that a little werid to werid. paragraph 7 give steps you should try out. Paragraph 8 gives us examples,and 9 says Did the computer bring a smile to your face. Like to me no its just to much their a computer that understands you,dont that make you fell weird. Like computer are becoming more human then us. And that scarys me more then anything like i cant have a computer watching me 24/7. but dont get me wrong this could be great as i said,this can help people who dont like to learn want to learn to better themselfs. Like i am right in the middle like its ok,but i dont trust it one bit at all. Like 1-9 Just makes me feel my computer is watching me now as i do a test.

22334,0,"An issue that many students have had for a long time in regards to attending classes at school is that it does not leave much time for other extracurricular activities or jobs. When you are working a part-time job, playing one or multiple sports, and attending school full time, these can place a heavy burden on an individual. Even if you are sick and miss only one or two days of school, you will have to make up several assignments in a very short period of time, which can put tremendous amounts of stress on students. There have been many proposed ideas that have attempted to solve this problem, and one of those ideas is having online classes. I believe students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it allows students who are sick to not miss any assignments or content, it lets students who have multiple outside activities to have time to complete those activities, and it allows students to learn in a more quiet and stress-free environment without disturbances from other students. Students who are sick are often advised not to come to school, and most students follow this advice. However, the downside to this is that students will often miss a full day of content they did not get to learn, or assignments that they did not get to complete. When a student returns to school, they will most likely not have a chance to learn the content they missed and as a result, these consequences can have negative effects on a student's grades. With online classes, a student can learn all the content that is being taught that day at home, which allows students to return to school being caught up with the rest of their class. For example, if a student was sick and missed calculus and English class, they could use their home or school computer to watch a live stream of the classes, or a previously recorded video which their teacher can assign to them that covers all the content the student needs to know. This system would benefit the student and it is a great reason why students should be able to attend classes from home. The next reason as to why students should attend classes from home is that it allows students with jobs or other extracurricular activities such as sports, to work at their own pace. If a student is playing football, working a part-time job, and attending school, it makes it hard for them to balance all three of these activities. Having online classes allows these students to work at a faster pace and complete their assignments quicker, leaving more time for other activities such as work and sports. Because of this, students are no longer under pressure to find a way to balance out multiple activities at once and therefore, can be much more productive in terms of playing sports and working a part-time job, while also being able to attend classes without being slowed down by the pace of the rest of the class. The third reason as to why having online classes is beneficial is that students can have the opportunity to learn in a stress-free and more quiet environment in their home, rather than a large classroom with twenty or more students. Being in a classroom with so many other students will more than likely cause disruptions that can affect a student's ability to learn what is being taught and as a result, negatively impact a student's grades. Online classes can easily resolve this problem by letting students learn within the comfort of their own home. This is especially beneficial for students who work best without distractions or interruptions. Another benefit of online classes is if a student is watching a previously recorded video of a lesson, the student can simply rewind the video to review any content they may have misunderstood. This is much better than asking a teacher to go back to a certain part of the lesson in an actual classroom, because it may be holding up other students who want to move forward. Also, students can also work at their own pace without the distractions of a normal classroom. Therefore, online classes can help students overcome challenges that students may experience at school. Using all of the aforementioned reasons, it is clear to see why students would benefit from being able to attend online conferences or live streams of classes at home rather than school. The benefits outweigh the costs with online classes, with the only real negative factor of online classes being the lack of social interaction with friends that students may only see at school. However, there are many more positives than negatives in regards to online classes, and I firmly believe that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home."
15979,0,DEAR PRICIPAL I believe that you are being to harsh on all of your students cause many kids love to play sports like playing for the school basketball team if you are saying that the students have to at least have a B isn't that kind of mean and sad because some of your students are making C and D. And that's not fear to them cause they have to stop playing their favorite sport until they get their grade up. And when their parents find out their messing up in school they are going to do the same cause they want the best out of their child and some parents take grades real serious and will punish their child until they at least have an A or a B. And that can make that child or teen really mad and sad cause they would have to work much harder and study even more if they want to get back out there and have fun playing that sport they like and having fun with there friends teaching them how to play there learning how to get better at that sport.
13979,0,Community service is good for the community but i don't think its fair for all kids to do it. Kids should have choice if they want to do community service or do other activities. The people who do community service do it because they want to not because they have to. The people who don't do community service even if they had to they wouldn't put any real hard work into it they would just go threw the motions and try to wait until it is over which wouldn't help out at all. kids who don't want to do community service will try anything to get out of it. They will probably ruin any fun for the people who do like to do community service with there negative attitudes. You also have to think how are you going to make them do community service if you tried to do it at school it would cut into class time and if it was after school how do you know that parents would make there kids do it. It could also cut into other activities such as sports or studying. It would just be a nuisance for the school and the kids. There really isn't a good reason to make kids do community service.
15680,0,"Dear Principal, I think making a policy stating in order to play a sport a student must have a B average is an amazing idea. It would pressure students to get better grades, make the school better know for it's great grade point averages, and would inspire the smarter kids to get more involved in sports. This policy could do wonders for the student body. First of all, this policy would pressure students to get better grades. Not everyone can get A' s and B' s with flying colors. They may need a little work and enforcing this policy will give some students the drive to keep trying. Second of all, it would help the school have a better reputation. The better grades the students have the smarter the school seems. If more grades improve more people can learn about the policy. Not only the people in the school but the people outside the school too. Therefore, more parents would want to enroll their children in the school. Finally, policies like this can include the smarter kids in school to get more athletically active. Not only athletically active but socially active also. They can tutor other students to help them come above their low averages. All in all, I believe this policy could really improve the school. By getting the students better grades, giving the school a good name, and giving smarter people the chance to shine. This policy is an incredible idea. Who would disagree?"
24479,0,In this essay I will be talking about when people ask for advice they sometimes talk to more then one person because they are trying to get other point of views then just one point of view. first you can ask like your friends they well be brutally honest and if they are not then they might be doing it for your own good for you so they dont hurt your feelings and so your friends would help you. Also ask different ages of people so you can get more point of views so you can get mute- perspectives on what your talking about. Another idea that you could do is ask your parents cause they have prrbollay been thought things like this so ask them. Why it would be a good idea to get more point of on the thing you are talking about because getting their people thoughts can help you in So many ways. Like asking friends and or family can always give you advice. Otherwise you can ask teachers can help a lot cause I ask my teachers on point of view before anyone because they have helped so many kids in there life time it is insane. One other thing is that asking different ages an help the more older you ask the more wiser your answer will get. Like if you ask you grandparent they know more then all kid combined because they have been through twice as much as we have. Almost every person will go through something that we need more input in and we will ask older people to help us and they will help us as much as they can. Asking you parents is a good idea to casue they have know you ever since you were born and they know you better then anyone so if you need good advice I would go to them first and the grand parents and then friends because they will help you more then anyone could. In conclusion asking for advuce can be hard sometimes because you could get in trouble casue there is a right time and a wrong time.
8580,0,"Using details from the article, i can write an essay evaluating how well the author supports the idea, that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by, while yes there are many risks to exploring Venus and other planets but in the long run it could help out. The reason it could help out is if we found a planet near ours like venus that in some way shape or form could be inhabited by humans it could give society and its people more places to go so we dont have as many over populated areas. an other big reason we could benefit from figuring out if venus can be inhabited is if that planet has usefull resources we can stop using as many GMO'S as we do in our foods. A place that has the biggest issue of having overpopulation and has to resort to using GMO'S in there foods is japan. some places in japan the overpopulation is so bad that it has created a very large increase in the amount of polution that is in the air, Its so bad in some areas that in the morning you can see the polution while just walking which has made it so the kids/adults of japan have to wear some sort of mask to not get sick/ get poisened by the air. If we do end up figuring out that venus and some other planets in our solar system can be inhabited we can decrease this issue by sending some of those people to Venus. It's not only in japan that this issue of overpopuation is occuring, you can see it occuring more and more in the USA with all the refugees and people from other parts of the world coming to live in the USA. The reason i am making these claims and the information i am using to support my reasoning is, in the text it stated that. "" Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth. Today, Venus still has some of the features that are analogous to those of Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features suck as valleys, mountains, and craters. If scientist can conform that Venus was once inhabited by some sort of life form, they can possibly figure what type of life form this was and maybe figure out why they are no longer there. If they can figure out why that certain life form left or died off we can possibly reverse what had happened. which will lead us to being able to inhabite another planet and could reduce the amount of over population and further problems here on earth by splitting up our population. It could also help the human race live longer and help so that the human race does not die off. In the long run i do think that figuring out if the planet Venus can be inhabited, i also think that from my information and the information that the author gave you to can see the reason why this discovery is so crusual to our society and race."

Then another thing why i think its not a good idea because a lot of people phones get stolen then you'll have a lot of parents coming and stuff like that. I also think not allowing phones in school period is the best idea for the school safety and the students safety because would anybody have to worry a bout there phone getting taken and the teacher won't have to worry a bout someone phone going off while she's teaching and whose texting in her class. sincerely, STUDENT_NAME"
9090,0,"The article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is an article that talks about the idea of exploring Venus. In the article, it mentions a plethora of challenges that come along with exploring Venus. The challenges include such things as: 97% carbon dioxide atmosphere, clouds of highly corrosive sulphuric acid, atmospheric pressure greater than that of Earth, and many other things. However, the author still thinks it is a great idea to explore Earth's sister planet. I happen to be one of the few, or many, individuals who think he supports his ideas very well. Although Venus is not the safest place to explore, the author points out ways in which it can be done. He mentions NASA's idea of allowing humans to float above the fray as a way to see what is on Venus. When he says ""above the fray"", he is saying is that we could just place a blimp-like vehicle that hovers about 30 miles above Venus's treachorous landscape. This could work because as the author mentions, jet airplanes fly at a higher altitude in order to avoid dangerous storms. Storms that could knock them out of the sky and send them crashing to the ground. The author also points out some interesting caveats that might prevent us from doing anything scientifically productive. They mention how just simply floating above Venus only allows us to see only a limited amount of stuff on the planet. This would be due to the conditions on the planet, such as the atmosphere being too dense to allow light to penetrate it. They also mention how researchers would be incapable of taking samples of things like rock or gas. Luckily, scientists are working on innovations, possibly groundbreaking, that can help achieve an actually productive exploration of Venus. One such innovation is a simplified electronic that is made of silicon carbide. This is put to test in a chamber that simulates the conditions on Venus. The researchers are also looking back to old mechanical computers, which aren't a whole lot like the computers we have today and are more resistant to extreme conditions. Unlike our computers, these compuers make calculations using gears and levers. In conclusion, the author supported his claim well that we can explore Venus despite its dangerous atmosphere. They rightfully point out good technologies that can be used to circumvent the atmospere and still be able to have a productive exploration. An example of such is the old mechanical computer."
6600,0,"Have you ever felt like you don't know anyone or don' t really have a hobby? Extracurricular activities can change that. Many people have found their passion and have continued on and have become very successful because of a club or activity they were in as a student. I believe if we require extracurricular activities, students have the opportunity to make new friends, discover new interests and cure their after school boredom. Firstly, getting students involved in an extracurricular activity will help them to make new friends and meet new people. This can help students make friends with a similar interests. For example, one of the most beloved country music duos of all time, Brooks and Dunn, met through extracurricular activities. In 6th grade, the two joined a club called FFA and fell in love with it. Their FFA chapter had a bus for the members when they went on trips. The old, rusty bus had no radio. A couple close friends of the boys had saw them sing in church before and suggested they sing on the trips because of the broken radio in the bus. The boys agreed and sang all sorts of country songs for the members as they traveled. The boys had such a passion for singing what was on the radio that they figured they would produce songs for the radio. Now, they are both millionaires and travel to sing all across the world. In addition to making new friends, extracurricular activities sprout interest in other hobbies. In 1988, a mother signed her child up for music club because she was working late and didn' t want her daughter at home by herself. Little did she know, her daughter would be one of the most famous singers in history. Her daughter was the worldwide phenomenon, Taylor Swift. Taylor was a shy kid. Though she had a passion for music, she was to scared to sing in front of people. While being in music club, Taylor gained enough confidence to sing in church. While singing in church, a record label producer was there and signed her to his label. She is now producing music and make millions of dollars. Lastly, extracurricular activities give students something to do when they get home, after school. Some students come home and immediately turn on the TV or play video games, instead of exercising or doing their homework. If it wasn't for a policy at J.K Rowling' s school would would not have the many great books we have today. Her freshman year of high school she entered book club. She gained a love and passion for science fiction books and decided to start writing them. Many of her books have been turned into movies and she is now one of the most successful authors of all time. In conclusion, extracurricular activities are very beneficial to our students in many ways. They can help our students be successful in our future careers. I believe if we require extracurricular activities, students have the wonderful opportunities like making new friends, discovering new interests and giving kids something to do after school. These can help students in many ways and help us develop a successful future generation."

I know, some people don't like do get out much but this is better than anything you can do inside. It is a very good experiance to go seagoing. You get to see a lot of different places and meet different people with different life styles. Sometimes it is weird hearing them talk, but sometimes it can be funny. The people also ask about our country. They wonder about the people, food, and animals that we have. They also wonder what our houses look like. I think you should go seagoing because it's like nothing else. Traviling the sea, and seeing the water as the sun sets. It's like nothing else. I also love the sound of the ocean. It calms me when I miss home. But sometimes, the ship feels like home. I very much wish so that you will go seagoing, because it's the best thing you will ever do. If it doesn't interest you thats ok. There are millions of other things to do. Maybe it's just not for you. But for me, it's just right."
14830,0,"Dear Principal, With respect, I think it would be unfair to force teens into community service. I think if you encouraged us a little more, some would find the time for it. Others cannot find the time for it. Some students are taking after school classes such as dance, music, art and other things. Other students have family matters or are piled on with tons of homework that is mandatory to get done. In all honesty forcing students into community service would only make them angry. They would find ways to get out of it or would pull parents into it. Which would only cause way more problems than the school needs or already has. And that is only a small portion of students. As for those taking extra curricular classes, they would be just as disappointed. They would most likely have to drop out of those classes to find time for community service. Those students would be upset for having to stop dong something they enjoy for something they are pushed into. Which again would bring parents into the picture. Those with family matters such as sick relatives or far away relatives would probably be more sad than anything. Being pulled away from the extra time they have to go visit family is now being put in to community service. This would put more unwilling students into community service. Plus, those with tons of homework who are struggling to get it all finished are struggling more. Having to work harder because they don't have as much time as they used to. This leads to grades dropping and suddenly A and B students failing. In my opinion, students should have the right to decide for themselves to participate or not. That means less drama for the school and more happy teens. Which is fantastic news for you. I hope this helps you in your decision. Sincerely, Anonymous Student"
24790,0,"I think asking other people for help is a good idea especially asking several people. When asking more than one person for their own opinion it make's you look at the situation in different view points. If you need advice for something one person might say something completely different from what you thought of. Where somebody else might say what exactly you were thinking. When asking several people for the same advice or their opinions it will make you not only think more about the subject but it also helps you with different view point. One person will have a negative side to it and the other person will have a positive side to it so you would be able to think what's the worst that could happen or what's the best that could happen. Personally I think it's better to ask more than one person, because you might be going through something and somebody gives you their advice, it almost is like they give you their strength to do it. I think as an example: say you are getting bullied, but you dont wanna tell on them because you are scared. You might go to a friend and ask for advice and you friend might say you need to tell on them, because if you tell on them they will stop but if you don't tell on them, they will continue to do it. If you have advice to do it from a friend more than likely you will go and tell on the bully or whatever your scenario is. In my personal opinion helping somebody else always may not only make you feel good but it also helps your friend once their problem is solved or at least been helped. When asking for advice, or somebodies opinion it could really help you out. When asking one person for their opinion might not help you as much as asking several people for their opinion. When asking several people for their opinion, it helps you a lot more by not only giving you extra help but by making you think harder and look at it in different ways. Asking your friend for their own opinion might not always be good because some people make bad decisions and might tell you to do something that will get you in trouble. In this situation you have to look at the pros and cons to the subject or to what they told you for their opinion or advice. If you think about what they told you if it was good it might and probably will help you. There so, when asking somebody something always think about it before you do it. I always think about what I do before I do it, because if somebody gives you advice that might get you in trouble and or put you in a bad place to get hurt or even worst that would be your fault in the end. When somebody is asking you for help or is asking for advice they want you to help them. The person giving advice wants what is best for you so always go with what they said once you explain your situation or what you want. I would ask the person first and say why do you give that advice, or why do you say that, or why is that your opinion and see if they can back up their answer with a good reason. If they can give a good reason than I would go for it to do what is best for me. Also if it would help then go ahead and do what you need to do to get the problem over with or whatever your situation is."
13522,0,"The Face on Mars The Face that was found on Mars, was not created by aliens, it is a natural landorm. It's a natural landofrm becuase, scientists studied it, it is popuar, and there are pictures. Some may not believe that this is a natural landform. But, there is some information to make you want to believe it. Stuides by scientists have shown that this Face is not just like any other. It was not created by aliens, and it is not normal. In the text it says,''Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.'' This describes how unusual this Face looked. There is no way that this Face was created by aliens. It is far more detailed that what aliens could have done. The Face that was found on Mars, was very popular. The uniqueness of the Face made it stand out more to others. In the passage it says,'' It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows-even haunted grocery store checkout lanes for 25 years!'' This tells the reader how the Face on Mars was important to most people. The Face on Mars was to be known all over the world. Scientists took pictures of the Face on Mars. The pictures let you know what they look like and it gives you an idea of what they are describing. In the text it says,''Twenty five years ago something funny happened around Mars. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face.'' There was trial and error problems with the pictures. In the text it says,''The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face.'' In 2001 they took another picture, and this one was more clearer that the one taken in 1976. The text also says,'' Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's aboslute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 neters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. Some apponents may say that the Face on Mars was made by aliens. Maybe they have a point. In the text it says,'' Some people think the Fcae is bona fide evidence of life on Mars-eveidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists.'' But, the photos that were taken make it clear that there is no way the unusual Face was made by aliens. In the text it says,''As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. As the years go on, people may still wonder how the Face on Mars was made. Some may still think that the aliens did it. Others might never get to know the real answer. Some say that the Face reminds them of something on Earth. Thus, this must mean that the Face on Mars is a natural landform."
4428,0,"Some schools make kids do summer projects to assure they continue to learn on their break. In my opinion, I think that the projects should be student-designed. I think that because some teachers might be to hard on their students and make them do to much work. For example, teachers might make the projects to long and not give students enough time to enjoy their breaks. Another reason why I think the projects should be student-designed is because the sutdents can choose a topic they enjoy and not have to do a project based on somehting they dislike for the whole summer. I also think it'd be a good idea for the projects to be student-designed is because the student can time him or herself and complete the project in time for the next school year and not fail. If the summer projects are teacher-designed, the teacher could take advantage and make their students do way to much for their break. If the students end up having to do to much work over their break then whats the point of even taking a break? Students will end up hating their summer breaks when in reality the summer break is supposed to be the best time of the year to enjoy the outdoors and do all kinds of fun stuff. They wouldn't have to use up to much time focusing on their project and have time to spend it with friends and family. What if that sttudent had already made plans to go on a family trip and come back with no time to do the summer project because it was to long? Imagine having to do a school project that takes up the whole summer that is based on something a teacher would enjoy doing. If the school projects were student-designed they could make a project based on what they like doing. It's bad enough they have to do a school project over the summer but they can at least enjoy doing the project if it was student-designed. For example, if I were to make a school project it would most likely be about science because it envolves fun science expierements that could be done outside in nice weather. Doing a project that was designed by me would mean that I could do fun stuff and learn at the same time that way I could enjoy my summer and get a good grade with no problem. If the summer project was student-designed they can plan out the project and make time for it so they can turn in the project fully complete. For example, they can make trips with friends and family and plan out what they need to do for their projects and how much time they would have left to do fun stuff. If the project was designed by a teacher they wouldn't know what to expect and would have to cancel on some trips they had alrady made just for a school project but, if the project was designed by a student then they could possibly include their friends and family into the project and everyone could have fun and enjoy summer. The students wouldn't have to worry as much about the project grade because they would have already done it and complete by the time the next school year comes around. In conclusion, the best choice would be to make the school projects student-designed. everything would be just right for that student and can assure teachers that most of them would complete the school projects. With the project being not to much work they can enjoy their summer. if the project were to be about a subject the student likes they would have fun and learn at the same time during the summer. The students would have a huge advantage if they could plan everything out and have good time for the project if it was student-designed. At the end of the day, both teachers and students would be happy with the project being complete and students being able to enjoy their summer time outdoors with friends and family."
14120,0,"Dear Mr. Principal, I do not think you should make it mandatory for everyone to do community service for a few reasons. The first is because you shouldn't make someone do something they really don't want to do even if you think it is good for them because you are not there parent. Another reason is because if you make people do community service they will do the bare minimum of work that they are suppose to do or teach a child how to do math wrong, or read words a different way then everyone else. If they are cleaning up trash i doubt they would do all the work they're suppose to. I bet they might only pick up a couple pieces of trash, and complain about it the whole time. I understand it might help the community a little but if they do no work or teach a child who's learning to read the wrong way it will take so much more work to help fix what that person has done. I get that your trying to help, but all i think it will do is make things much worse for the school and the community. I also think that you should make as much school time as you have to do actual school work. You could open up another band class or give us study hall sense we don't have it or maybe make home base even longer. Find another way to help students and the community. There are a lot of things you can do to help. Just don't force people to do community work. Its just going to make things so much worse,"
12356,0,"The ""face"" on Mars is just a natural landform. The face on Mars is nothing more than a huge rock formation and is definatly not created by aliens. The face is an amazing discovery that NASA has made when they went to Mars. The face is just a landform that can have the illusion of a face. The illusion is created by shadows giving the look of eyes, nose, and a mouth. On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his MOC team took a picture of the face that gave a much sharper look of it than the first pictures ever taken. That's when they truly discovered that the face was not a alien monument. Later they have got an even better picture. The picture shows is landforms that are like the ones around the American West. The face was like a butte or a mesa. Pictures proved that the face is nothing more than a illusion created by shadows. The face is a natural land mark that is like some of the ones on earth. The face is not created by aliens. After all who knows if there is such thing as aliens."
22225,0,"Mrs. Principal, I understand that you are reconsidering our school's cell phone policy, and I would like for you to take my ideas into consideration. I believe that both policies are honorable ideas, but neither is shear perfection. For the first policy, you proposed allowing students to bring phones to school as long as they were turned off during class time. The students would most likely be satisfied with being allowed to use their phones during lunch periods and other free times. Yet, there will, in all likelihood, be a select few that will attempt to continue to use their phones during class time nevertheless. The second policy stated that students should not be allowed to have phones at school at any time. Although this would dissolve the issue of phones being on during class, most every student would be outraged at the thought of not having a phone on their person. Plus, parents might be disgruntled about having no way to contact their child once out of school. I propose that you combine both policies to create a more plausible one. Say that students would be allowed to bring their cell phones to school, but it must be turned off and put away at all times. The only exception would be before school started and after the final class of the day is dismissed. I sincerely hope that you take my proposals into account when making your final decision about the cell phone policy. However, I am aware of the fact that you are the principal, and the choice is, in every respect, yours to make. Sincerely, A concerned student"
6655,0,"Extracurricular activities have been around for decades, they've been proven to help students socialize, and keep students active. In my opinion, it is best for every student to be able to experience after school activities in order to find what hobbies they have; or even later on in their life, find out what career they might want to pursue. As technology advances, and the times change, the amount of activities readily available for students to participate in, will increase. Today many of those after school, or even in school activities can vary from, sports (football, baseball, soccer, basketball, table tennis), art and photography clubs, councils, donation groups. There are a huge assortment of fantastic groups, clubs, teams, you can choose from, typically they do not require a fee, or any payment upon joining. A great example of an extracurricular activity is, JROTC. JROTC is a program that teaches highschoolers, and sometimes middleschoolers about what you will learn, and what you'll do in the military based on it's respective branch. Not only does it teach the process of basic training, and what's to come, you will learn discipline, respect, honesty, and to be physically ready to get through basic training. Sports can teach you teamwork, and being a good sport, while promoting good health. Creative arts could help students relax, and bring out their artsy side that they didn't know they had, or cannot bring out at home. I believe it is more important to take part in extracurricular activities if your school doesn't have recess or gym. Back in elementary school, recess was the major part of the day that you would be excited for. That 45 minutes or hour was the peak of the day where you could get your excitement out, talk and play with your buddies, or just relax and nap. Me and many others were quite disappointed when we got to middle school, that recess had been replaced with gym or study hall. Then I remember learning about clubs and after school fun that I could do. For me, this was even better than recess, you had a lot more options than you would with just a playground, maybe a basketball court. Depending on what they school provided, it seemed I had the power of choice. This time around I could chose if I even wanted to stay after school. Staying after school, you can chat, play, with your friends, I think this is a wonderful outlet for people who may be having troubles at home, maybe they don't have friends and they want to find someone to hangout with. School can be the best place, or the worst place for people in need. In many ways after school activities are good, however they have their cons. For some, their parents force them into after school activates, regardless if they would like to or not. I believe you should throw yourself into some things and see how you like them, but if a student really does not want to be there, then they should have an alternative to be able to chill instead of forcing them to do an activity they don't want to do. Again, it's for the benefit of the student, not the parents or the school. Bullying could also stand a problem in after school activities, but the truth is, bullying and foul people contaminant every where you will go, even adults in the real world. Bullying, just like world hunger is something that cannot be fixed, we do not live in a perfect utopia, the likes of such are impossible as there will always be bad people. There are though, many things we can do to prevent this from being common in extracurricular activities. You should stray from separating kids, as that can make it easier to gang up on a single group of people, or one person alone. Promoting good sportsmanship and including everyone can keep it on the level side to make sure everyone is having fun. Overall, after school activities are a great idea if you maybe want to get your mind off things, take a break from what might be slowing you down and beating you up in life. The only way to beat depression is to get up out of your hole, do something to ease your mind, and never get bored. Maybe you just wanna have fun with your friends, and talk, play, plan, with them because you live a great distance from each other. If you want to prepare for the real world, and get ready for what it will mean to serve your country, be apart of your community, contribute to the work force, there are many options that schools provide for you. No matter who you are, where you come from, it doesn't matter, everyone is welcome to participate in extracurricular activities."
15731,0,"Dear principal, I believe taking away sports or other activities for students with less than a B average will not be helpful to them because school activities help students, sports are healthy, and studying all day can be stressful. I think school activities are helpful to students. Some teach kids to be responsible and others teach them to be creative. If you are working on the school yearbook you can become very creative and it will benefit them in the future. Jobs require some creativity such as being an artist or musician. Taking this away will not help them. Secondly sports are healthy and get students active. It is a healthy alternative to watching television or playing video games. It is also a fun way to pass the time with friends. Some people may think sports will distract students minds and keep there grades low. When you do some activities such as sports you become less lazy. Some students don't do homework because they are lazy. This will help them. Studying or working all day with no fun can be stressful. Students need some type of fun and these school activities are the healthiest. If you take these away it will lead to stressful students and students doing unhealthy activities to pass the time such as watching television or even doing drugs. Some people may be thinking studying is very good. Studying is very good but too much is not good. This all means that taking away activities for students C averages is bad. It will help all studew"
11450,0,I think using the Facial action coding system in students in a classroom is not good and the same thime bad. The students shouldt be using that they dont know what can go wrong. The technology in 2018 is getting bigger and smarter. The technology is taking over jobs and everything. The facil action coding can be use for some important hings like like they can use it in the police office or somewhere that they really need it. The students can choose to use it or not they wont do it if they dont want to thats like making u do it. Some students will be surpice and some afraid of what might happen to them if something goes wrong. The technology makes alot of great things to hellp us who needs it. Teachnology can end up with the world if bad people do bad things to technology. I just want to be safe and have technology that helps me do good in my life. I maybe use the facial action coding to see how my emotions are but not use it for fun every minute. The Facial Action coding should work just find so all students can use it if is lik e we trying to see if it works good then the students shouldt use it. I think that the Facial Action Coding should only be use when that person wants to try it and is not scare of what would happen if sometimes goes wrong while checking her or his emotions. Techology sometimes is bad and good but more times is for the good ways to us.
25736,0,"When you are seeking advice it is a good idea to get it from multiple people. Seeking advice from multiple sources is a good way to get advice because different people might have a different point of view, they could have prior experiences, or they could be of older age. I believe that seeking multiple opinions could help you more than just one. Asking different people for advice is a good thing to do because people have different points of view. All people think differently, so getting different sources of advice is a lot better than one source of advice. Different people have different mindsets so, lots of people have a very good and positive mindset and they are the people you want to listen to more. Some people also have a negative mindset and they might theink on the down side of things but, sometimes they could have really good advice on things. Lots of people have many different points of view on things. When getting sources the best sources are the ones who have prior experience with what you are seeking advice for. If you decide to chose someone who has been through the same path, it would be a good idea to get advice from someone who chose the right thing to do in the position that you are in. It would also be a good idea to get advice from a source who chose the wrong path and have suffered the consequences and know how important it is for you to choose the good path. It would also be a good idea to get advice from a source who has done something similar to what you are looking for advice for, because they might have a little way to make it easier. Getting advice from people with prior experience is a very reliable way to make a good choice on things. Going to talk to elders is a very good source for you to make a good choice. Elders will always have a few stories from what you need advice on. When they get to that age that their at, they will become very mature and wise about the topic. The thing about elders is that they will always know what the right decision is and know how to lead you there. Elders are a very reliable source to guide you to make the right choice. Seeking opinions from various opinions is the best way to help you make better choices. Seeking advice from multiple sources is a good way to get advice because different people might have a different point of view, they could have prior experiences, or they could be of older age. In conclusion, using lots of sources/ opinions is the best way to guide you to make good choices. I challange you, when you need help making a choice, to get as many sources as possible."
25244,0,"Online shopping is never an easy task. After locating what you want to purchase within the vast sea of goods, you must decide which specific type of your desired item you would like. Different companies sell differing styles of the same item, and you may not know at first which item style will benefit your uses the most. That's the time when you ask for the opinions of real, physical people. You may wonder how many people you should ask for the inputs of. The number of opinions you receive can affect all kinds of decisions you make, not just that of what company to buy from. Seeking multiple opinions will assist you much better in your decision-making than asking a single individual will. Among the multiple people you ask, some will be experts on your topic. Some will be highly experienced in the action you need help in taking, whether it's buying a new television or selecting the next spot for your summer vacation. These two groups of wise individuals will have the most trustworthy advice and thoughts. Their inputs will be the main benefactors of your decision. However, not everybody has something noteworthy to state. Some people you ask will do nothing but waste your time. They will act like they know what is being asked of them, but everything they say to you will end up being completely nonsensical. These speakers of logic-empty phrases are advisers to ignore when seeking useful inputs for an important decision of yours. Another detail to observe when asking for advice is the neutrality of the response you receive. Inexperienced advisers can be a hindrance, but the biased can be just as much of a distraction. Looking back at the online shopping example, some of the people you meet will try to endorse a certain company or strike down a company they do not like. Others will have had an unsatisfactory experience with their product, but the cause of that may only be because they were not successful in making their item work properly. A certain product might truly be a bad choice for purchase, but you cannot make that conclusion without talking to multiple people and hearing the same complaints from everyone. After asking a group of individuals, it will be clear which side of the story is true. The concept of majority comes into big use here. In order to avoid advice that sways you, the thoughts of multiple people should always be sought out before you make a decision. While you should note that not all advice is worth being followed, keep in mind that some inputs are legitimate and should be taken into account. By ruling out opinions that do not help and reviewing those that do, any and every decision you make can and will be the best one possible in any given situation."
23993,0,"In recent years, many students have chosen to attend classes at home rather than a traditional classroom. This method of education is called distance learning. When a student is distance learning, they learn the material that is taught in a classroom, but they are in the comfort of their own home. The students have two options to chose from in distance learning: attend the classes online or participate in video conferencing. Video conferencing is when a student watches a class or a teacher to learn or study. Students benefit from distance learning because they can learn at their own pace and the comfort of their home surroundings will help them to focus. All students learn at different paces. One student may be excellent in one subject, but terrible in another, or, they could be great in a subject overall, but not in a certain topic within that subject. For example, a student could have high grades in geometry, but have low grades on the Pythagorean theorem topic within geometry. When a student is in a classroom and requires assistance with an assignment, the teacher would have to halt the lesson to help the individual student rather than the entire class. Although, when a student is being taught in their home, they can pause, repeat, read, take notes, or use other methods of study that would interrupt a classroom without disturbing any other individuals. In addition to the individual being capable of getting assistance or studying without disturbing an entire class, the comfort and familiarity of their home will improve their focus. They will not be distracted by something that is unusual to them at home as they would in a classroom because they see it every day. The students have less distractions and can easily avoid them at home. Although, in a traditional classroom, there are usually students who are friends that like to have conversations with each other. This is affects the individual negatively because they cannot study before, during, or after lessons without getting distracted. In the students home, there are less individuals to distract them. In addition to there being less distractions, the student's home is a safe zone for them. Students feel more comfortable at home because they are not around multiple individuals that they are not acquainted with. Teachers may argue that distance learning is not an adequate method of education because the student will not be completing their assignments due to the lack of authority. Although, this is incorrect because the initial reason that a student does not complete assignments is because they are rushed in other classes. Being rushed in other classes results in having more work to complete, therefore, they may not have enough time to complete all of their assignments. When students work at home, they have more time and flexibility to complete their school work and are more capable of understanding the topics they must learn. In addition, a student views their parents to have more authority than teachers. Therefore, distance learning is a better option for students than a traditional classroom. States should require all schools to have the option of distance learning available to the students. In addition, instead of issuing textbooks to students who would like to participate in distance learning, schools should issue laptops or tablets for the school year to help more students become able to participate."
17697,0,"What do I think about driverless cars? I am for them and I am also against them at the same time. I do think that driverless cars are good for people who do not know how to drive very good, and for people who do not want to drive. I don't want them because I like to drive, and I like cars. I think driverless cars would be good for people who are bad drivers, because then those people would not be causing trouble on the road. Also people that are scared driving would be better for them so they wouldn't be nervous and could relax in the car. The reason I do not want driverless cars though is that I want to drive, I don't want a computer to do it for me. I love cars to and its fun driving them, what would be the point of that dream sports car you always wanted if a computer was going to drive it for you. Also, computers are pretty smart but they dont know everything for instance, if a deer runs infont of you on a backroad would the car know that usually more deer come after that, or would it slam into the second deer, would it know the roads like you do. So I am for them and against them. I think I would be better if they were optional so if you didn't want to drive you could buy one but if not you can still buy a normal car."
13717,0,"Some of my friends perform community service. For example, some tutor elementary school children and others clean up litter. But some think community service is a waste of there time. So i am here to tell our school principal if we should be required to perform community service. So far i think its a good idea but i need reasons. Community service is good for ever community but not all types. Lets talk about school there are over about 500 kids and to be honest only 20 percent of the kids care about there school. So if we made community service required how much of it do you think would actually get done. I think that it would be same way with homework because so many kids don't do homework it would just be the same with community service. On the other hand community service would probably give students more time to actually help there school and show there school is good in there community by being a leader and picking up trash that isn't there's. This would also make them care a lot more about school work and start doing school work and helping there community by not being lazy all the time and blowing off homework and school projects. Community service would also let people know that, that school is the school i want my child to go to and have a positive affect on other people. However, if schools made community service required then it would most likely turn schools around from being lazy and make there students fit and focused on school more then going home and playing on the computer or watching tv. Community service would also help the elderly and the environment by cleaning up trash that could even hurt animals. I think that if trash and spray paint on side of buildings would clean up our communities and make our schools and communities look more attractive for others. Therefore, i think that we should have community service in our schools but it should also be optional so kids don't feel more pressured at school. Then if this works our schools should be better and more students would care about there future and school work. So community service couldn't hurt to try and i think it would have a positive affect on everyone. Now i look forward into hopefully more students enjoying school and helping there community."
9877,0,"Do you think it would be easier for technology to do the work for the teachers and identifying their face expressions during lessons? Some think it would be better ways for humans and computers to communicate. This could be a big step for the future. In my attention getter or introduction, Dr. Huang predicts, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming comfused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" This shows that someone somewhere can be inventing something like this to help students in the future and can also upgrade technology into a better cause. Facial Action Coding System also knows as FACS has been invented by Dr. Paul Eckmen, ""The process begins with the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles"" (D'Alto paragraph 6). This just shows the way it works and how it has to be human muscle movements, Eckman has also classified six basic emotions which are happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Overall, the value of technology should be for a better cause and can help many people in different ways such as students by looking at their facial expressions on a teacher's lessons if they don't understand the topic. This is another way it can change to computers and humans to communitcate."
2647,0,"I don't think there should be a limit on car usage if you bought it you can ride till the wheels fall off it's your propery but also recent studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes. But America's love afair with it's vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peeked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. as of April 2013,the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the eplanation certainly lie in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyways. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next years will be telling."
21774,0,"Dear TEACHER_NAME, I think it would be a great idea to have the students be able to bring their cell phones to school. After school they can use them for various reasons. If the student is staying for practice or tutorial, they can call their parents or guardian to pick them up. If they miss the bus or need to clarify how to get home they can use their cell phone to contact their parents. The parent can also call the student if they need to talk to them about something. Students can use their phone to do research as well. Another reason they should be aloud to use cell phones is because cell phones can be used after school too. Many students walk to McDonald's, Trade-winds, or other stores or restaurants in that area. The students need cell phones to be able to contact whoever is picking them up. During break students can also use cell phones for entertainment. Students should only use cell phones in the designated time. I think you need to warn them that if they take advantage of having cell phones at school, they will be banned from school immediately. Any student who takes advantage of the new policy will be put into punishment and a number of continuous problems will shut the new policy down. During class, students should not be able to use their cell phones, because they can start cheating, texting, or being off task. To stop this, I suggest that at the beginning of class teachers should pick up all cell phones. If a student is caught with a cell phone after they have been taken up, they should have the phone taken and held for a certain amount of days and the student should be put under punishment.

Second of all not driving a car can help to lower the air pollution around you. according ro one acrticle they stopped driving an estimate of four thousand cars and has dramaticcaly lowered the amount of smog(greenhouse gas) in there towns air. so if you stop driving cars it will help to lower the amount of smog in the air of your city or in the community around you. ""The smog cleared enough monday for the ruling french party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on tuesday"" in this article one city gave up driving lots of there cars for a while and doing so lowed the amount of smog in the air. Third of all driving a car is really not needed for many things. Why drive when you could just walk or ride a bike to where you are going there is really no point in you driving a car now and then. Not driving but walking also opens more doors for buissness to be put in next to side walks or just in walking distance of your house. So there are many good things that can come from not driving a car and those things are. Not driving a car can make you less stressed out. Not driving can lower the pollution in the air by alot. and finally driving is not intirelly needed for situiation."
4651,0,"With students required to attend school up to 10 out of the 12 months of the year, a summer vacation is an extremely valuable time for students to relax and spend time with family. But along with rest and relaxation, it is a fact that most students end up forgetting a good amount of the knowledge they have learned in school. One way to prevent this is through summer assignments, which are widely used among schools across the nation to keep students' brains stimulated, even throughout break. But an issue that most students face with these summer assignments is that teachers assign huge, time-draining, assignments that often end up consuming their once-relaxing summer vacations. Schools should make use of student designed summer assignments, ensuring that students' brains are stimulated over their summer vacations, as well as still allowing students to have adequate rest and relaxation during their breaks. Contrary to some people's opinions, students know their own learning capabilities better than teachers because of the large portion of students' time being spent self-studying. Students know the extent of work they can handle, and this translates into student designed summer assignments, which allow students to stay engaged over the summer in a way that is fit best for them. Summer assignments should not be taking over a students' summer vacation: a time usually spent relaxing from all the hard work put into the school year. Having student designed summer assignments allows students to assign themselves as much work that they think that they can handle over the summer. It is common knowledge that each student learns differently. There are auditory learners, hands-on learners, visual learners, and combinations of all three. Having a teacher assigned summer assignment creates a strict border of a style of learning, leaving some students with more trouble than others. Student-designed summer assignments allow students to choose what type of assignment they have, allowing for maximum brain utilization and better results. For example, a hands on student may choose a science lab for their summer assignment whilst a visual learner could watch a scientific documentary for their summer assignment. Thus, ensuring that both students' brains are working at the best of their abilities. Some may argue that teacher designed summer assignments ensure that a student is actively learning throughout the summer. But, student-designed summer assignments get the same job done, just in a more efficient and better-suited way. Student-desgined summer assignments are far superior to teacher-designed summer assignments because they allow for students to create an assignment that is not overwhelming and best fits their style of learning."

Seagoing Cowboys get to experience what it's like to tavel to different countries, learn respinsibility, and learn about cultures they might never even heard of. We would like you to be our newest Seagoing Cowboy. After your first trip you might even want to invite your friends to become a Cowboy too. Seagoing Cowboys see new places, because of the work that they do. They must take food, animals, and supplies to countries who can not grow and thrive after tragic accidents. In the passage Luke Bomberger and his friend Don Reist become Seagoing Cowboys and work together on a boat traveling to Europe. In Europe the people had just fought in World War II and had no food or supplies, not even animals. So the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration sent supplies and animals on a ship to help the people in Europe. Seagoing Cowboys learn responsiblity by taking care of the animals and crew members on board their ship. In the article Luke must take care of horses, young cows, and mules by giving them water and food, cleaning the pens, and pulling hay and supplies from the lower decks. Seagoing Cowboys not only take care of animals they have to watch out for one another. In the passage Luke was almost knocked overvoard but thankfully a strip of metal caught him and his crewmates pulled him back aboard. The people who do sign up to become Seagoing Cowboys get to travel around the world and learn about new cultures, eat new and interesting foods, and even get to see amazing landscapes and structures. In the passage Luke got to see the Panama Canal, a castle in Crete, and even spend time in China and Europe. Luke took nine trips from one place and back again-that's the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. Seagoing Cowboys have great experiences. They learn new thingss and see new places. Plus who doesn't love working with animals. It would be a great experience and lots of fun to be a boy or man to travel to new countries and learn new things. We hope to see you on our next trip and have a great time."
14276,0,"Dear Principal: I think that students should be required to perform community service. The reason that I think students should be required to perform community service is students lived in this city too so, I think that they need to do something for their city. For example: recycling is not the hard thing to do. Student can tell their friends to recycle to help the environment. Student can uses the paper in a correct, but not wasting the paper. For what I know the paper are made out of trees and tree help human a lot for their health. Trees give oxygen to human. Student can also help by throwing the garbage in the garbage can. Even if they see it on the street they can pick it up and throw it in the garbage. As a human being we can do a lot of things to help the environment. We can plant more tree instead of cut down the trees. Students are the people that have educated so, they should know what the right things to do. Students today, they should know how lucky they are. People back then, they can't go to school without money so, most of the people didn't go to school. Instead of going to school they have to work to help their parents. Today, in the United States we have public school everywhere. All the kids in the United States are require to go to school. To be honest in my country we don't have public school like in America. All the poor kids in my country didn't go to school like they suppose to. They have to work to get the money to help their parents. I think to do the community service is not the hard thing to do. Nothing you can't do if you try. Nobody born as a winner or a loser you decided what yourself will be or can be. I think students today, are wasting too much stuff. I think they should stop wasting all of that stuffs for nothing. They should save all the things that they has and use it widely. Everything is bought by money nothing in this world is for free. There are so many things that students can do or as the human being we can do. In school you can help your friends with what you know and they don't. I was helping my friends with their work, when they don't understand something I always feel welcome to help them. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME"
22693,0,"Over the years, the use of technology in schools has become more and more normalized, Sites, such as Blackboard and Google Classroom are used throughout the school year by teachers, students, as well as parents. There are many people that are skeptical about these changes, but especially the idea of schooling through online programs. Some feel as through it isn't in the best interest of students, and shouldn't replace a traditional education. Although some disagree, students would benefit from attending classes at home because it'll improve mental health and allow more flexibility. Students would benefit from enrolling in courses at home because it'll simply be easier for some. Mental illness can be very debilitating and can significantly affect a student's performance in school. A lot of the time, this is overlooked, or simply ignored, as it is often stigmatized. Conditions such as anxiety and depression are common examples, and stress will simply exacerbate one's symptoms. Such things would make attending school extremely difficult for some students. Being able to do coursework at home would likely alleviate the problems they were having before, allow for improvement, and later success. Other things that people don't always think about, or may even look down upon, is treatment and recovery. Relapse, tragedy, etc would be common examples as well. Being able to do courses online might be the best option for someone that wants to take time off to get better, and return to school once they're ready. In conclusion, people face situations that others might not even think about, and so they shouldn't be stripped of an option that would ultimately be best for them. Students would benefit from enrolling in courses at home because it allows for more options. Some may do better by planning out their day based on what works for them. For example, school is typically an 8 hour day, from 9am-3pm, 5 days a week. This is probably fine for most, but others simply can't operate like that. For example, some people might feel more attentive in the evening, and therefore can be more productive then. Some might have a hard time focusing for long amounts of time, and do better with breaks throughout the day. The list goes on. Traditional education is usually very restrictive and doesn't accommodate for people that don't do well with said issues. Another reason this would be a better option for students, is so that one would be able to plan out their day and fulfill responsibilities. This might be work, taking care of siblings, or parents, and so on. But, it might also include other activities, like sports, music, travel, etc. Online schooling would be convenient for those with different lifestyles. In conclusion, all of these things would be made possible while allowing a student to receive adequate education. Many people make the argument that doing courses from home isn't an appropriate way of learning, and should be done in the classroom. Reasons will include things like, ""it's an excuse for students to continue bad habits and remain irresponsible"", ""it was good enough for us back then"", or ""they should be able to do it like everyone else"", etc. Some may hold such opinions because it's simply an unconventional way of learning, or allows students the freedom to do things their own way. But it stems from the belief that a student's reasoning behind it are unacceptable. There's also an assumption that homeschooling is a new concept, when it's not. The only thing that's changed is one's ability to access resources from home, through their computer. Adults essentially do the exact same thing when they do their own work from home. This is known as teleworking. For example, my mom, an economist, gets to do this several times a week because it gives her a flexible schedule. Certain occupations, such as computer asssistance allow for this too. If reasons that include mental health, or individual preferences applies to both adults and students, why should there be a double standard? In conclusion, the most important thing is that all of us have an opportunity for success, and whether one gets there online or on-site shouldn't matter. Everyone's situations aren't the same, and so each individual one should always be considered, not compared to others. Advancement of technology has helped many people all over the world, regarding education. The ability to receive an adequate one is essential for one's success and benefits the many people who don't have access to it. This not only includes K-12, but post-secondary education as well, as online degrees and certifcations are continously being introduced."
11826,0,"Thomas Haung made a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System. The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model for the face. All 44 major muscels in the model must move like human muscels. I think this system should be added in schools because during school teachers will know how their students are feeling. In the passage it states that a teacher points out that this system can recognize when a student is confused or bored. This system is really useful in my opinion, because you can recognize all emotions someone is feeling. You can recognize by looking at them but only 1 or 2. with this new system you can find them all. Another reason why this system is a good idea is because even if the person is trying to hide their emotions you can still find it. This new sytem is a great idea/invention. this needs to be known. mor people need to know about this amazing idea. All in all, i think this is a great system and they should add it to schools. It will help teachers and students. You will recognize every emotion the student feels. It can help lots of people. What do you think?"
12724,0,"NASA is a goverment funded project that uses science facts, pictures, and advanced technology. NASA has been constintally working hard and, according to the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars."" ""NASA's Viking 1 spacraft was snapping photos of possible landing sights for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face."" As soon as NASA saw the picture they instantly started going to work to see what it was. NASA has already created scientific technology for this reason. They would want to get the best looking picture and the most acccurate one. The acticle states, ""Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos."" The first immage they snapped revealed that it was nothing but a landform, but still people were not satisfied. On April 8, 2001 another photo was captured at the cameras maxium view. Each pixil spanned 1.56 meters, compard to Vikings 43 meters per pixel NASA has been specifically designed to explore outer space and to discover what was there. They have been working even before 1976, Thats more than 40 years! They have only had a number of break throughs, proving that NASA would not hold back information about ancient civilizaions or alien lifeform because it would be a great breakthrough. The defenders of the NASA budget even wished there was an ancient civilization on mars. There was a degree of suprise for mission controllers at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared. They were fascinated by what they saw. The alien conspiercy believers may reject the pictures and say they have been tampered with. NASA would not do that, however. They have already spent loads of money for this project and made all the equipment. They would not go through all that trouble just to lie to the public. NASA also took may pictures with their instruments from many angles and different views. They are high resolution photographs and they even have 3D alimetry, according to the article ""Unmasking the Face of Mars."" Overall, NASA is an important space project that is honest and truthful about their work. They prove their claims with scientific facts and photos. They have the brains, tools, and budget that allows them to do that. If the public is not happy with their results they will find a different way to show it and find more evidence that will satisfy them."
24738,0,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person, Thats because they want to choose the right decision and if they choose wrong, then something terrible could happen, or you will just regret it. Sometimes you question your self and ask ""should I do this or that?"" sometimes you go with your own advice, or you go to a friend or someone. But in my opinion, I think you should always ask a friend, or a family member, for advice even if you think your advice is wiser/better than theirs. Seeking multiple advice from different people is good because it makes gets you thinking about what to do in that situation like, ""do I do this do I do that!"" so you gather all the advice that you got from the people, you asked and you talk about it see if thats what you want to do, and you do it like I said your advive isn't bad, you just think that the other advice is better, like say you got accepted to two different colleges take your own advice then go get more advice from a family member or a friend, So you got their advice you compare it to yours, and see which one you like more. Seeking advice from other people is good, like I said It helps you with your everyday life."
19816,0,"To begin with, I think we should keep Electoral Colleges because there are many benefits. A Electoral College is a process not a place in wich the founding fathers established to compromise between the election of the president by a vote in congress and eleciton of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. Some of the many benefits are a voiding run-off elections, it helps citizens votes be more meaningfull. For starters, Electoral Colleges help avoid run-off elections. The benefit of having it avoid run-off elections is, that when there is a run-off election and when no canidates win a majority of the votes cast; the pressure is greatly reduced because of the electoral colleges. As a example, as a example you only have 43 percent majority of the popluarity votes. If more votes in the college is elected to one president than the other the president is alot more likely to win. In addition, another reason on why we should keep Electoral Colleges are because it helps citizens votes seem more meaningfull. How a Electoral College does this is by, making you vote more powerful. If we didnt have these colleges democrats in Texas, and Republicans in California would know there vote wouldnt mean anything therefore they would not pay much attention to the election than if they knew the president was picked by populat votes. That is why in 2012 only half of the eligable voters voted because they knew that there vote would not make a difference. In conclusion, that is why i think we should keep our Electoral Colleges, because is helps by avoiding run-off elections, and it helps citizens votes more meaningfull and has more power to know that popularity votes now count because of the Electoral Colleges and more elegible can now vote with confidence."

11397,0,"The faicl action coding seems like a good idea. My claim is that it would be cool to go into a classroom and be able to tell what mood your are in. It says in the passage ""a classroom computer could recognized when a student is becoming confused or bored."" That would be a really cool thing to do at school. I think its a good idea asnd I am not going to argue about this suggestion. If you can walk into a classroom and you can tell if a child is happy, sad, confused or even just bored you will be able to know if they are okay. If a child is sad you can try and help them and out and see what is going on. In the passage it says, ""hold on, we can actually calculate emotions."" well yes if you actually give it a try. It would be seriously so cool to know how someone feels just by looking at a screen when they walk into a classroom. I think it would help some students, honestly if you tried this expirement. Students wouldn't know what to think if they had this in their classroom. None can just walk into a classroom and tell if they are happy or sad. It says that ""the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer of the face, all 44 major muscles in the model must move like humans."" They said that they have classified ""six basix emotions- happiness, surpirse, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. This might help a lot of people out if they do this. If you can tell a kid is sad you can help the kid. Maybe he or she is having problems at home and they need help but they don't say it. The facial action coding system might help people. It's a good idea, but it's actually a reall good expirement to test it out and see whats going to happen. You can alwyas take it out if it doesn't work out, or if it does you can keep doing what you are doing and you'll be able to see kids facial expressions and what they feel when they tell you they don't feel anything. Facial Action Coding is just a different way to expirement different things about children. Maybe teachers can bump their classrooms up to funner and more satisfying things, because you will know if a kid is bored in your cass if they have that. It says that ""each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion)."" Let's just try the facial action coding out and see where everything goes, but it seems like it's going to go good. I totally agree and I don't argue with this expirement. You learn something new everyday."

Venus often referred as earth's twin has the same density and size and it is the closest to our planet as well. While researchers try to land a spacecraft on the surface of venus it is almost impossible to because the temperatures on venus are an average of 800 degrees farenhite. The pressure is 90 times more than what we experience on our own planet so we would be crushed if we stay there. Thats only the beginning of what goes on there, there is erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking on its surface. But even after that it is just like our planet earth because scientist have been looking at venus and found that venus has a surface of rocky sediment and othr features like valleys, mountains, and craters. They have also found out that there use to be covered in largely oceans and also could've supported various forms of life. The conclusion to all this is that even though venus is dangerous and also good at the same time that we can still explore it and possibly have human life living there."

To imagine a world with driverless cars is futuristic and almost unthinkable. America is the fattest country in the world. To have driverless cars would be one more reason for obesity to sky rocket. America has become so lazy and unhealthy it is ridiculous. Not that driving burns tons of calories, but it is much more beneficial than just sitting back and allowing the car to do all of the work for humans. Another reason driverless cars would not be beneficial is because what if somebody had gotten into an accident by chance and was not able to get out of the car, or even out of their seatbelt? The doors could be locked and cause great danger to one's life. If by chance someone was to happen to get into the accident, who would get in trouble? The driver or the manufacturer. It would cause a great deal of trouble to figure all of that out. New laws would have to be set in place"

24553,0,"Do you think you will make a better choice when seeking opinions from other people? I believe so. I think that asking multiple people will help you make a better choice because you can get more opinions, receive feedback, and come up with a better idea. By asking more people, you get more opinions. If you are stuck on a decision and don't know what to do, ask people to help you make the decision. With more opinions you can look at all the different views of the decision and decide what is best. Sometimes people make decisions on just their opinion, but other times it is in your best interest to ask other people because they could have a better opinion or judgment on the topic or issue. One time I was doing my homework and I did not understand how to do it. I asked my parents for some advice on how to do my homework and with their advice, I was able to understand the homework. Receiving feedback is important when it comes to advice and opinions. When asking lots of people for feedback, they can give you some suggestions and tips about what to improve on for whatever you are doing. It helps you build on what you already have and make it better. Once I was doing a really important project for a class and went in during resource to ask the teacher for feedback about what I could improve on in the project. I got some feedback on what to improve and did it. I got a better grade on the project after I changed it then what I would of gotten before. Feedback on something can also help for future opportunities. Those are the reasons why I think receiving feedback is important and helpful. When doing something, having the best idea is always good, but you can't always come up with that on your own. If you have multiple people trying to come up with a solution, you can combine their ideas to come up with the best idea/opinion. There is also more creativity and brainpower put together when you have lots of people working to try and come up with the best idea. In school, one of the reasons why teachers do group projects is to try and get multiple people working together to come up with a really good idea or solution. Multiple people working together is how you get the best idea or solution for whatever it is you are doing. I believe that seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. I think that because you can gather more opinions, receive feedback, and come up with a better idea. You should ask other people for help before you make a decision on your own."

As exciting as it would be to discover living beings on mars, there is no evidnece today that would support that theory. Here at NASA, we have been debating this topic for more than thirty years. The Face could not have been created by aliens because there are no alien markings and there are landforms very similar to the Face here on Earth. When analyzing a digital image, you can dicern things 3 times larger than the actual pixel size. If aliens had created the Face, there would be some kind of marking that the aliens would have made. On our 2001 trip to the big red planet, we used our best cameras with their absolute maximum resolution. The images that we took showed no sign of any martian markings. This proves that aliens could not have created the Face on Mars. Here on Earth we have many different types of landforms. One of which looks very similar to the Face on Mars. This landform is called a Mesa. These landforms here weren't created by living beings. They were created by natural causes, like erosion. So, since the landforms here weren't made by creatures, why would the landform on Mars have been made by creatures? There is no evidence that proves the Face could have been created by alien life forms. In conclusion, although everyone here on Earth would love to discover that the Face was created by aliens, there is no evidence that can prove that theory. There are not any alien markings and there are landforms on Earth that look very similar to the Face on Mars."

People use their phones while driving to keep in touch with some people when it can wait. Even connecting your phone to your car for hands free its still dangerous because your more into texting or snapping someone back when it can wait. If its an emergency you should pull over and put your car in park and do what you need to do instead of endangering yourself or other drivers on the road with you. Many people say that hands free set is a safety because you have 2 hands on the wheel instead of one on your phone and the other on the wheel. But however i think its still not safe because you would be more into texting or calling someone instead of driving. People have been immune to their phones that they gotta be on their phone every second even while driving. Its not just young drivers its older experienced drivers too. Many more people say its not safe to drive while with your phone because your endangering your life and other drivers. The leading causes of death in a car accidents are drunk drivers or distracted drivers. Now a days you cant just drive your car you gotta look around your surrounding for an example cars swerving in your lane while on their phone. What would you do? Speed up or slow down or stay riding next to them. You have to be on your p's and q's while driving because you have inexperienced drivers and experts. What ever is on your phone could wait because its not going away instead of risking your life while driving. In conclusion, don't use your phone or operate your phone while driving because it can lead to many more problems than texting back""ok"". You don't want to end up in the hospital thinking why did i do that i should've waited. Your not going to think about that while driving. Obvious the person your texting don't care about you if they texting you while your driving. If people don't put their phones to the side its going to be more deaths in car accidents. They shouldn't endanger many other people lives for a simple text or something. Don't think about just your self, think about other lives on the road with you. You also have to watch out for other drivers too."

Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has an idea that they want to send humans to Venus to study this planet, but there is a lot of dangers involved if they do that. The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by giving all the reason why humans should go, bad things that could happen if humans landed on Venus, and things they can do to make this idea work. NASA already beleives that there could be life on Mars and that people could be living on Mars in a couple decades or even less, so why wouldn't they want to find that out about another planet. It has already been suggested that there once was life on Venus. In paragrpah 4 it states ""Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth"". NASA thinks that being on the land we would be able to study it better because they don't think peering at Venus from a ship orbiting is doing enough. It is also giving them challenges that they can work on the equipment to make it last longer. In article ""the Challenge of Exploring Venus"", it does state the bad outcomes if we landed on Venus and what could go wrong. In paragraph 3 it talks about the conditions on Venus for example, ""On the planet's surface, temperaturess average over 800 degrees Fahrenhit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet"". It also states that the condition on Venus are more extreme than anything humans have encountered on Earth. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in or solar system. These things are very dangerous, but despite the dangers this article is still able to support the idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit. In paragraph 5 they focus on things they would have to do to avoid the dangerous conditions, for example one thing is allowing scientist to float above the fray. Floating over the fray of Venus would be just like our jet airplanes. The conditions in Venus are not easy, but they would be survivable for humas. The only way to study Venus well is by being on the planet because looking at venus far away can only provide limited insight on ground conditions. Scientist want to be able to take samples from the ground and from the rocks on Venus. The dangers of going to Venus should not stop us. It is worth it to face some of the dangers to make history and discover new things especially on another planet. The dangers of Venus will only push scientist harder to find a way to make it to venus. It will also push them to design new technology that could stand being in Venus's conditions. There is many evidence to prove that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers."

6314,0,"Have you ever thought about staying after school with your friends? To maybe relax and talk to some of your teachers, play some basketball with the upper classmates, and spend time with others that you don't normally see. Many are the reasons why forcing students to complete at least one extracurricular activity a week is important. First of all it will increase the number of other students you have connections with, you could find a new hobby or spend time to perfect one, and finally bad behavior will decrease and lead to healthier choices. Although It is always important to take a break by spending your time on something you truly like, extracurricular activities not only expand your knowledge but also your friend group. By spending time with others that have the same passions as you, you will find connections with other students and make friends. Therefor if an individual just moved from another state, chances are low that they know anyone, after school activities like basketball will bring them together with many others. Higher levels of education can bring an extreme everyday stress, being able to play a sport or do puzzles instead of keeping it to your self, will release a lot of it. This activities can also help you find hobbies you might to pursue in your future years or even as a career. For example enrolling in the student council will maybe spark an interest in politics, and year book club a love for photography, the possibilities are infinite. These grades of school are all about changes, if an activity you started at the beginning of the school year does not interest you anymore, you could always switch to an alternate. Because practice is a big factor of success, perfecting a hobby you already know is also great. While trying all of this, you will always find someone that will be with you. Staying after school hours will decrease bad decisions. In a closed and constructed environment supervisors will always be around to guide the student to the next level of their learning. Instead of just going home and laying on the bed or couch for endless hours, staying at school will give you motivation to do your home work. Sometimes just staying after school is better than being alone. It's easier to be pushed with the wrong people whose principles are not healthy. I try to stay after school at least once a week, one time for constructive work that will teach me something unusual, such as MUN ( Model United Nations), and another day for recreational purposes, like basketball for the school's team. The participation of every student in extracurricular activities once a week is essential, and an extraordinary idea. Although school already takes about 8 hours a day, staying after school at least four times a month is a valid usage of your time. Gives everyone a chance to discover new hobbies or make some of their old ones even better, it helps the students release stress and find new friends but most importantly it increases a healthier life with fewer bad decisions. Having the chance of staying after school gave me the possibility to make one if my closest friends, and to win many middle school MUN conferences. Overall the effect of after school on students is positive."
7110,0,"Humans are like penguins. Just as penguins huddle together in the midst of a storm, humans huddle together in groups and find comfort and healing when they're with people that have the same interests. If that's the case, joining extra-curricular activities is a good opportunity to not only build life-long friendships, but also learn about different clubs and hobbies everyone can dive into. For starters, being on a team automatically builds friendships and an unbreakable bond. A team is a group of the most valuable people in your life because members encourage one another and lift one another up. In many professional games, team members root for each other and help each other to be successful. When you see members respecting one another, there's no doubt about the friendship and love between the members. Also, people with the same hobbies become close very quick because of the same passion. I have met many of my close friends through the love of sports. Since my team had the same love of softball as I did, I felt as if I had known them for many years and something just clicked. Lastly, teams stick together. Through thick and thin, players stick together. Many professional players have been with each other for a long time. Since they've been together, they know each players strengths and weaknesses and how to help them. Gradually, a friendship forms and a life-long partner is born. All in all, being apart of a group not only forms a deeper love for the sport, but friendships beyond compare. Second, anyone and everyone can be apart of a group. This is the perfect opportunity to try new things and learn about new hobbies. For example, many people didn't even know a club about learning sign language existed, but after trying it out, they became in love with the art of sign language and ended up becoming translators in the future. Also, you never know where this small hobby can lead to in life. For instance, one of my favorite hobbies is playing chess. When I was first forced to attend the club, I didn't know anything whatsoever about chess. However, I soon realized I loved playing chess and it was a good opportunity I seized. Lastly, everyone deserves a safe community full of people with the same passion. Research shows that those with a group to be in have a stable mentality and more self-confidence. Therefore, joining a simple community can even boost self-confidence and open doors to unknown hobbies. In conclusion, being apart of a team or club benefits many aspects of life such as an incredible bond and friendship with team members, and a safe environment with other people that share the same interests. Something as simple as joining a club may change the way you perceive life. Just like penguins, everyone deserves a place to be."
24103,0,"No, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home. There is a lot of action students have to take from being home school. For example the state has to make sure their doing their work instead of sleeping and lacking around. You have to be responsible and be aware of your work. I'm not saying all students can't attend online classes at home, but most cannot. Going to school helps you learn and understand things better. if you dont get something, you can ask for help and the teacher can explain the problem to you. You also have a person teaching you instead of you reading things by yourself and trying to understand. Being in class accurate and up can keep you from falling asleep instead of sitting around at home eating and sleeping all day. In addition of other students because i can't speak for everybody, some students can handle that and learn way better on their own than having somebody teach them. School groups is also another reason how student learn faster and better. Working in groups help you learn more from other students. Other students may know more than you or you might know more than them, which is a good thing. Everybody has their own ideas and opinions. You can't forget some students are antisocial and like to work alone. If you are one of them people, than working alone and at home is best for you because you have nobody around to bother you. Another reason being home schooled isn't a good idea because you have to be responsible. Doing your work, making sure you up, and making sure you finishing it on time. You have to make sure you get up on time, not staying asleep to long, or staying on your phone. Being at school you have to get what you need done, at home is like you know what you need done but you can do it later. Which makes you lazy, staying at home eating,sleeping,and playing on your phone makes you lazy. Its gonna make you forget that you have school to do. On the other hand some students are responsible. They know what have to get done and they get it done with or without any one telling them what to do or reminding them. School is learning place where you come and get your knowledge from. Every parent should put their child in some learning program where they get taught not taught on their own. School is the most popular place in the world. Getting a education and great job is good reasons why you should come to school. Great job equals great money. Good education equals a high advance in getting in wonderful colleges. With out school you life won't be to bad but you know you can live a way better live with school."
22752,0,"If you were able to take online classes wouldn't you take them. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home. Distance learning is a program that allows you to take classes by way of online instead of physically attending a class. Taking online classes has many benefits that contribute to your personal life and also your student life. Online classes allows you to work at your own pace, have more time for yourself, and be able to work without any distractions. I believe that distance learning is a great option for schools to offer students. Physically attending a class can sometimes be stressful. Teachers only have a certain amount of time to teach you what they have plan for that day and they tend to rush you. But what some teachers don't understand is that everybody doesn't learn at the same speed. It takes some students longer to understand what they are teaching. If you take online classes you wouldn't have to worry about anyone rushing you, because you can work at your own pace. When you attend a class you really don't have time to take care of yourself, especially if you have multiple classes in one day. When its time to leave school you probably have to go straight home because you have to write an essay or have other homework to do. Also if you play a sport that makes it harder, because you have to balance your life, school, and the sport that you play. With online classes it makes it so mush easier because you can get your work done early in the morning instead of waiting for school to start for you can go to class. Just think about the extra time that you could have. Having classes with other people can be very distracting. In all your classes there's always going to be someone or something that is keeping you from focusing. At home you don't have to worry about anyone distracting you. With online classes you can do your work peacefully. More schools should start offering distance learning to students. I believe that students would do better in school if they had online classes. Online classes gives them the chance to work alone and not be distracted by anything. Schools should allow students to choice if they want to take online classes. Everyone doesn't work at the same pace."

This thing you have to do is, drum roll please..... not using your car. I know it sounds crazy right now but let me tell you about all the good that comes out of it, and maybe, just maybe you'll change your mind. Now as most of you know there is alot of pollution all over Earth, and this pollution is caused by alot of things, but the two main reasons are cars and power plants. Pollution caused by cars affects alot of things including greenhouses. When smoke from a car reaches a greenhouse it produces a gas that negativly affects the enviroment. Your probably thinking that it's no big deal because ""theres not alot of greenhouses"", but that's where your wrong. As Elisabeth Rosaenthal says "" Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"". Another thing that is caused by cars is smog. Robert Duffer, the writer of Paris bans driving due to smog, wrote that "" Paris typically has more smog than other European capital...[Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found"". Congestion in France was down 60 percent after almost a week of intensifying smog. They had to stop using cars of course, but it was the only way to get the smog to go down. Now that we've talked about the bad stuff caused by cars, let's talk about the good that can come out of not using a car as much or not at all. alot of people who participate in not using a car, weather it was for a day or for forever, have said that it reduces alot of stress and air pollution. Lower air pollution makes for more clean and clear air. Which means you get to see the day better than before, and who wouldn't want that. Overall it not only helps you, but it also helps the planet you live on, so give walking a try, you might even find seeing nature around you better than driving by it."
18929,0,"To state senator i'm argue is that we should keep the Electoral College because it's a place where we vote on President and Vice President,and the place where we count the votes,and the Electioral College process consists of the selection of the electors. Reason number one is it's the place where we vote on President and Vice President because it's in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in congress. And election of All the soon President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. Reason number two is the place where we count the votes is because a majority of 270 electoral vote is required to elect the President. And when we vote for our candidate we are actually voting for your candidate's electors. And each of the candidate running for President in our state has his or her own group of electors. And reason number three is the Electional College process consists of the selction of the electors and that is my thrid reason is because were states's entitled allotment of electors equal the number of members in it's congressional delegation:and one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for you senators. And this are all my three reasons why we should keep the Electoral College."
21047,0,"Dear Principal, I think policy 1 is the better policy 2 because if you allow students bring phones to school lunch will be less noisy and students will always have something to do during free time and less students will get in trouble for sneaking texts or calls since they will have a time to do it. If you allow cell phones lunch will be less noisy because everybody will be busy texting instead of talking loudly and goofing off. Lunch would be a lot better off if we had cell phones because there wouldn't be a lot of auguring because everybody's texting instead of getting in to dumb arguments. If you allow cell phones at school students will always have something to do at free time. teachers will never have to send students to there lockers to get something to do they can just pull out there phone and surf the web or text. There will no longer be a student sitting at there desk doing nothing. Also If you allow cell phones at school there will be less lunch detentions given out for student getting caught texting during appropriate times. There will be very few detentions for students because most detentions are because students text during lunch or home room. So if you would dear principal please consider policy number 1 over 2. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME"
11799,0,"This new technology is actually valuable. In the story they talk about how making yourself smile still can make you happy. This technology could really help because then they can tell if someone is really unhappy. Most people do not want other people to know what they are feeling but it helps people around you. This technology can tell you like what percent happy you are or digusted or fearful or angry. Like Mona Lisa's percentages were 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, and 2 percent angry. With people being able to know how people in paintings were feeling you can put together what might be happening or what they are trying to point out. This technology is actually very helpful because they can tell everything by just using a computer and using it on a painting to see what their emotions are. The computers can detect all 44 muscles in someone face. All the muscles have to move like human muscles. They say in the article that the movement of one or more muscles is called an action unit. The Eckman has classified six basic emotions and those emotions are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. An example they used by telling any of those is your frontalis pars laterials muscle which is above you eyes raises you eyebrows when you are surprised. A way they can tell that you are angery is when your orbicularis oris which are around your mouth tightens your lips. There are many different things that this technology can tell about you which could really help because it could let people around you know how you are feeling instead of having to answer and you just say your fine. Like you can kind of tell how a friend is feeling by just looking at their face. Everyone can have trouble describing like the reasons why they feel like that but atleast you can tell how they are feeling. Even if you do not know why they are feeling that way you can try and change how they are feeling. Like most people do not want to have to explain why they feel that way they just want a friend to be there for them and help you boost your mood. Computers are unstanding what peoples emotions are but they are still trying to figure out how to nonverbal communicate with someone. The article gives you instructions to do while looking in the mirror. The first instruction is to raise your lips at the corners of your mouth, the next one is to then squint your eyes slightly, to produce wrinkling at the corners of your eyes, the last one is holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up, toward your eyes. They ask if you express in the mirror suggest an emotion and it does it is a happy emotion. Experts can even tell by just looking at a celebrity and they can tell if the are being truthful about being happy or if the are sad. This technology could help many people. Do you just sit there sometimes and think what are they feeling or are they sad or happy well now you can tell by just doing some very easy things. Like you can use a computer that can recognize what you are feeling even if you are just sitting there doing something the computer can still tell. You can even learn ways to just look at someones face and can tell how they are feeling by just the muscles on their face. This can help friends they will be able to tell how their best friend is feeling and they can try and change their mood. Even if it does not seem helpful it really is, by just telling what someones emotions is by just looking at them can actually change a lot of things."
4449,0,"Imagine you're a teacher and you have to grade a project that you had no part in creating. Some schools are considering allowing students to design their own summer assignments. This would be counter-productive because, if students were allowed to design their own summer projects they would make the projects entirely too easy. When teachers design the summer assignment they can make sure that it follows the curriculum. It is also easier for teachers to grade assignments that they designed. Some people believe that, allowing students to create their own assignments would increase the number of students who complete summer assignments. However, many students would create a project that would not teach them anything, and be a waste of time. More students would turn in assignments at the beginning of the school year, but the quality of many assignments would be very poor. What would happen is, students would spend all summer playing games and enjoying their break, and then the last couple days of break would be to throw together a project without putting any thought into it. Secondly, when teachers design projects they can be sure that it follows the curriculum and provides a smooth transition from one school year to the next. If students were to design their summer assignments, without knowing the curriculum of the coming school year, the assignments would have little to no relevance to the course. This could confuse students when the subject matter of the course is completely different from the summer assignment. It is important for the summer assignments to be designed by the teachers, to ensure that they actually apply to the class that they are assigned by. Lastly, it is easier for teachers to grade projects that they created. The beginning of the school year is a busy, and stressful, time for everyone. Teachers do not need the extra stress of having to grade dozens of projects that are all designed differently. It is much easier for teachers to grade the dozens of projects when all of the projects follow the same basic guidelines. When projects are designed by the teachers who will grade them it greatly reduces the stress on the teachers in the, already hectic, beginning of the school year. In conclusion, summer assignments should be designed by teachers, so that they can be sure that the assignments are an appropriate difficulty, relevant to the coursework, and have the same structure. I encourage you to speak with, call, or email members of your local school board to prevent this proposed change. For the good of the students, as well as teachers."
24545,0,"""Advice leads to experience, experience leads to success."" When seeking advice, have you ever received bad advice? Bad advice can put yourself in unsavory situations which is why you should always have advice from multiple people. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice by providing different perspectives of that decision as well as including insight on experiences that they have gone through that are either the same of similar. Different perspectives from people can lead to better decisions made. Everyone has a different background which can include their ethnicity, economic standing, political viewpoints, religion, social structure, profession and so forth. For example, my mother is a full Korean, democratic person who is a teacher that believes in free health care. However, my father is a Caucasian, republican person that works at a government job that believes in the complete opposite. This in turn makes everyone especially unique and different when it comes to viewpoints and perspectives. When facing a choice, seek different people to get a variety of answers as this can help you discover different possibilities and consequences of your actions. Furthermore, different perspectives can also leave you with different choices than before. To summarize, Different perspectives can change someone's decision for the better and lead to less negative effects. Everyone has faced experiences and problems before in their life. The more diverse people around you, the more different experiences they have faced and overcame throughout their lives. Everyone can provide you with insight on the experiences they faced that could be similar or the same as yours. For example, my father got caught cheating on a test he was taking, but he lied about the cheating to the teacher. When the truth came out that he lied, the consequences were severe. This in turn helped my father realize that its better to be honest than to lie at all, which is what he told me when I was caught with little integrity. In short, experiences that everyone face can lead to more variety in choices. In summary, the culmination of ideas leads to a more detailed and effective response or choice that can have less negative effects and more positive changes. Looking for multiple opinions can lead someone to make a better decision by providing different perspectives of that choice as well as including much needed insight on experiences that someone has gone through that are either the same or similar to yours. Always ask advice from multiple sources to get variety in your decisions and see potential perspectives."

These cars could help us be safer on the road going to work, driving to school, or driving far distinses. These smart cars could help us to not be carles drivers and can help the number of crashes each year go down. The driverless cars have a long way to go. The cars shoulden't be controlled only 90 percent of the time, and the other 10 percent by human. It would be more dangerous if it was only controlled a tinny percent by man and the rest by semi-autonomous cars. What if the driver gets bored and tired, then he falls aslep and the car needed him to take over? This is why we need a 100 percent driverless car. It would be more safer. Driverless cars would really come in handy with high schollers just starting to learn to drive. High schollers are very carless drivers, and care more about showing off or trying to have fun then they do about there own safety and everyone elses safety. With these smart cars, new drivers can be more safe. They coulden't be able to show off or maybe even try to go over the speed limite. These smart cars could also be uesful with drunk drivers comming home from a party. Driverless cars have a long way to go, but they can really help us to be saffer and could help crime go down."
15870,0,"To the principal. I believe your possible policy change on sports participation standards is a good idea. I think students should have to get a B-average or higher, to participate in any sports activities. I believe this is a good idea because it will encourage students to achieve more, and work hard in school. Many students that are in sports activities are barely passing school with a C or lower, if you were to change the policy these students would want to raise their grades to stay in sports. While the students begin to work harder, the parents might pass word about how well this school works. More people may enrol students and spread the popularity of the school. With the schools new found popularity, and increase on students we may have more money for the school to use for, new books, better books and computers. Other schools may want to support our methods and expand the policy all across the city or state. In the process of all of this the student dropout rate may lower as well, because students will want to learn more. I support your policy 100%, but there could possibly be bad outcomes as well. Students may become furious and quit all sports, and possibly school in the future. The teachers may get annoyed with the amount of students trying to over achieve and quit, or punish the students. Parents enrolling more students may overcrowd the school and its property causing the state to shut it down. As you can see the good outcomes overcome the bad, and many of the bad come after the good. Please remember these are only idea, there is no promise that the change will cause the good or bad outcomes, but there is also no promise they will not happen either. sincerely A student."

This is a memorable event in American history because it was the first American to ever set foot on the moon. Before Neil made it to the moon, no one thought that it would ever be possible to make it that far. Now we are planning to explore Venus. The author states that he wants to explore Venus no matter what the percautions are. There are always good and bad effects of each action and the exploration of Venus has a lot of them. First of all, the author states that Venus is the closest planet to the earth when Mars is not; it depends on their orbits around the sun. With Venus a close distance to the earth, it would be easier to explore than any other planet in the galaxy. This planet has the most Earth-like features in the Milky Way which makes it attract scientists. There are so many valuable reasons why the exploration of this planet is a good idea. On the contrary, the most difficult part of the mission is Venus' atmosphere. Carbon dioxide takes up 97 percent of the atmoshere; also the clouds have highly corrosive sulfuric acid clouds. If that does not damage a spacecraft, the pressure that is 90 times greater than Earth will. The temperatures there way over exceed the temperatures on Earth; the temperature there averages over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. NASA has been working on spacecraft to make it there and they are making progress. Humans have already sent numerous spacecraft to land on Venus already; however, none of the spacecraft made it on the planet long enough for any human to survive there. The author constructed his information very well. The author explained why NASA wants to explore Venus. Facts were provided to let the reader know that this article is not just opionated but also factual. I really liked how the author explained why Venus will be a hard mission to achieve, it shows that NASA knows their weaknesses and therefore will be able to fix them. NASA has many backup plans in case one of them fail. In conclusion, this was a well written article. The author knew what he was talking about which persuaded me to think that studying Venus would benefit science. I also applied my background knowledge of the moon landing while reading this article; I knew that it once seemed impossible to land on the moon but we achieved it, now we are planning to land on Venus and hopefully will achieve that too."
792,0,"Phones & Driving In the present times, many people all over the world use their cellular devices either for activity planning, work related tasks, or some time to relax. Phones in this generation are considered an addiction to our lives and is in a way dangerous because of how easily we get distracted on to them even in times when we shouldn't be on them. When driving, all senses and attention is needed because an accident can come at you from anywhere, when you least expect it. Does texting and driving cause traffic accidents? When you lose focus doing something that requires attention give it full attention with no distractions because you or others could end up getting hurt. Driving is an action that does indeed require utmost attention when doing it, especially around other people. Distractions will get in the way when driving and ignoring it is the best course of action. Trying to drive can be difficult for some and it's understandable but those who do know how to drive still can cause car accidents do to lack of focus when driving which is why laws to prevent phone usage while driving have been put down and enforced by police to keep others and ourselves safe from car accidents. Cell phones were created for fast communication and to help us react fast if there was trouble or we were put in dangerous situations to get help as quickly as possible. Over the years, cell phones have evolved to be able to help us in our daily lives. An example would be reminders for occasions, calls from or to work/ video chat calls for face to face meetings if necessary, quick information gathering, and many more uses. The mobile era is riding strong and doesn't look like its gonna fall for awhile with many apps developed that can be downloaded and used on our phones from social media apps to learning ones. The use of phones has changed the lives of many to the best or worst occasions, meaning that phones are good for us only at certain times, not all the time. The fact of the matter is that phones are useful but can cause harm to us and others like health problems, mental problems, and tear what we call fun. Driving is needed for moving around quickly if your not feeling like taking public transportation to get to your location. Both the cell phone and motor vehicle were made to make our lives easier in the new era, but putting both together can cause issues and hurt yourself and others. Thinking of times without these tools life was a little rough and harder to keep up with, meaning that staying updated on friends and family or trying to get from place to place. Overall, the people know what's right from wrong and when to do something at the right time. Does texting and driving cause traffic accidents? The blame goes to those who don't abuse the technology of the new generation like bluetooth devices, speakerphones in the car, and smartwatches. The laws that help and try to prevent people from harm do their best, but the people need to contribute to helping each other. Driving and texting should be done separately to prevent accidents and just live life, while be safe from yourself and others."
19325,0,"The Electoral College is a process that should be around for plenty of years to come. It was established by our founding father as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualitified citizens. It's a simple process in which a running candidate would need a majority of 270 electoral votes. Our founding fathers came up with this process in order for the election of a President to run smoothly. When using the Electoral College you have an exact percentage of the outcome of the votes, no guessing or estamating. The Electoral College has a method of awarding electoral votes, inducucing the candidates to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states. This is because voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, making it easier for the candidates to study what the certain states needs are and convincing them that if they vote for them, their needs will be met. Some may say that the winner-take-all system isn't fair to some states because most of the candidates don't even bother going to the states that they know they have no chance in winning. Well this can be argued by saying that this method may help the candidates because if they know that they have no chance in winning in some states, they might specifically prepare a certain speech that may persuade the state to vote for them. Also no voter's vote swings a national election. The electoral college has many ways that can help a candidate win the election and it might make things more easier for him/her. The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have a trans-regional appeal. This means if the voter is from the south, they have no reason to campaign heavily in those sates. Instead they can spend more time in states that need a little more convincing fot the candidate to gain their vote. It also restores some of the weight in the political balance that a large states loses by virtue of the mal-appotrionment of the Senate decreed in the constitution. Some may say that the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote is something to worry about. But the Electoral College avoids the problem of there being a run-off election. If there was no Electoral College, this would put pressure for run-off elections, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, which it invariably produces a clear winner. So all in all, the Electoral College should be kept and stay the way it is. It isn't complicated and makes the election run more smoothly. It provides multiple ways for a candidate to win the vote of a certain state and avoids major problem during the election."

They've come close to building it but fails to be officaly called driverless cars, google has tryed but have only made it to where the car alerts a driver if to close to an object. Theirs been other ways on trying to make a driveless car but come out in fails or to expasive, like the smart-road that has been tested and has had positve records ""but that would mean we would have to change all the roads and make knew ones that would take for ever and the money we would spend on that would leave our economy more in dete then we are"". As the article said. If driverless cars were to be created in the future how would that impact lifes and country? Well let me tell you more safte laws would have to be made ""like how would be acounted for if some one gets hurt because of a failer in the system, would it be the owner of the car or the companys fault for the failer in their technology"". As the articl said that could cause major problams. With what I just mentioned that brings me to my second question. What if something in the car fails would that impact the intier car and cuase it to break down? As the artical mentions the people trying to creat the driveless car have been testing int with a lot of different technology as said in the artical they've been using sensors, cameras and GPS on the cars, but what if one of the cameras or the sensors would fail to do their job while it's driving on a highway or a main road that would cuase a worse accident then with someone driving it. In conclusion I would prefer driving so I have more liabilty to know where im going and know that im the one driving. So i ask you would you rather lay your life and family or friends on a a computer or know that you can drive. That is my opion on driveless cars."
16249,0,I think the principal should not change the policy for school sport because most kids try hard and get below a c and they might want to try out for a sport it should not made on there grades. Another reason is that no every one has a B average so why should they try even harder just to play a sport. I would not like it if i had to stay at a B average to play a sport. I think the student should have a C average to play a sport so they have a better chance at staying on the team. It would be hard for the students to stay at the B average because they would have school and then they would have practice or game so they don't have very much time to do other stuff. The last reason the principal should not change the sport grade average is because it gives student something to do after school.
7772,0,"I disagree with the principals decision to make all student participate in extracurricular activity. The reasons are that some students have no time for extracurricular activity, it to stressful and it to much money. Lot of student don't have time for extracurricular activity. Lots students have lot of homework and would not be able to finish it if they have to join a club. Many students have to go home after school take care of their younger sibling while their parents are at work. Some students have a lot of chore to do after school and would not have time if they started attending after school activity. These are three reasons why some students would not have time for extracurricular activity. After school activities are very stressful for students. Students have to do homework and do work for the club. An example of doing work for a club is practicing drill for your football team. Some student get less hours of sleep because they have to do all their home work after their clubs are finish. Some students get really stress taking to people that they don't now. These are three reason why after school activities is very stressful for students. Extracurricular activity can cost a lot of money for the families of students. Parents would have to pay for their child's school uniform, gym uniform and now they have to pay supplies for their child's club. An example of this would be gear for sports. Some clubs have fee that are 25 to 50 dollars per person which is a lot of money for parents of twins. Another example of clubs that have fee are the cooking clubs. Some family live very far form the school and that would be a lot of gas money going to and from school every day. These are reason why extracurricular activity costed a lot of money for the families of students. Time, stress and money and reason why I disagree with the principal's decision to make all students participate in extracurricular activities. I request extracurricular activity should be a chose for students that have time, is not stress to them and is cheap for them."
19586,0,"Dear State Senator, While I normally don't have any complaints, and being the person I am not many things ""bug me"", but I recently found that I disagree with a certain argument. And while it is near voting times, I believed it's best for me to send you my side on this continuous debate to change your mind on the matter. The electoral college has had its share of arguments and I would like to make my side seen knowing I have quite a bit of logical arguments. Please read with an open mind. The electoral college is unfair in many ways, this one however can be seen as minor. The electoral college gives an easier way to get tie, and although a tie hasn't been a main focus, it can prove to be a problem. I read an article stating that if a tie were to happen the election would be thrown to the house of representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. This would anger a heap of people for many reasons, one stating it would almost rule out their vote. Secondly, the electoral college simply takes away from voting in general. An example of this is lets say Obama won popular vote, he should win because thats what America wants right? No, because what if another president won electoral vote? that president would win and take away the point in voting. This is unfair because we the people would like to have a better say in who becomes our president. In the article I read, it stated ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. unfair, outdated, irrational"" I agree completely. How is it irrational? Well simply because it is just an extra step added on. In all reality our country would be fine without it. Popular vote is exactly what we need, and that alone is enough. And while I do believe it's good to go an extra step, it shouldn't go when not needed. This to me is most important because I could argue all day long and in the end this would be my argument. Thank you for your time and please take this into consideration, I realize that it has its upsides but it is just unfair, outdated, and irrational. And please notice the other downsides aswell, while I did not have the time or room to include them. Your friend, PROPER_NAME"
15399,0,"Changing the school policy to where you must have a B average is a good idea, but many students only have C averages. If the principle did change it, many students would not be able to play sports. A thing to remember is that if the principle did change it, the students who really want to be in the sport would probably push themselves in their classes in order to do better and be able to participate in the sports they wish to play. Sports are a big part of school. They raise money in concession stands, other students who aren't in the sport still go out to cheer on their friends, and the people in sports learn from it. I have done Cross Country in both seventh and eighth grade, and it has been so much fun. Although I keep an A average, I have friends that get B and C averages. Does that mean that only I should get to be part of the team? No, because those who get lower grades than I are still great runners. Another thing to remember is that a C is not a failing grade. If students had lower than a C, that is when they should not be in the certain sport they wish to be in. When it comes down to it, I believe that grades are more important than sports. Sports are a thing I think everyone should be in, whether it be Football, Volleyball, Cross Country, or even Marching band (yes, that is a sport). If a student starts failing classes and are participating in sports, they should be taken out of the sport so that they can focus more on bringing up their grade. Then, once their grades are up again, they should be able to go back into that sport. My father wouldn't even let me watch television if my grade went to a low B or C. I think he's part of the reason I keep my grades up. When I get all A' s on my report card, he smiles and tells me he is very proud of me. Therefore I smile, because if my dad told me he was disappointed in me I would start crying and that would ruin the rest of my day. Even if I see that I have a low C my stomach starts to hurt, because I know I can do better than that, and to see I'm a couple points away from failing makes me wonder how I could have let m grades so low. My dad was an A average student throughout his school-life, and that's why he pushes me and my sister to do better than our best and have us push ourselves to expect better. I don't get money when I get A' s, and I don't get any new type of furniture or clothing or anything else... I get happiness, not only from my parents, but from myself. I don't have the best concentration skills, either, but I still focus my best to succeed. If I can do my best to pass my classes in order to do what I love, which is running, then so can any other person. Making excuses as to why you're failing won't get you anywhere in life. If you love a sport like I do, then you will do what ever you can to stay in that sport. It is better to get a B average, but if you can't do that, then at least try to have a C average. It'll be worth your time, I promise.:)"

Likewise in space exploration, we must be curious about the planet Venus. Venus is a planet that is very similar to Earth in many forms. The reason for studying space exploration is explained in the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"". Although the Venus' conditions are very absurd, but the doors that it can open are well worth the hardwork needed to explore the planet. That is why the author explains that Venus is a planet that is worth exploring due to exploring Venus is able to open more pathways to other types of space exploration and the planet has very close relations with Earth. The author explains that it is true that in order to take step into the future, we must start space exploration. And the only way to do this is to start with a planet close to us. The author tells us that sometimes ""we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus"". If we are so close to Venus what is stopping us from exploring it? There are an abundance of things that stop us form exploring Venus. But the author must first talk about the similarities and differences between Earth and Venus. Earth and Venus are suprisingly very similar in many ways. Due to this fact, Venus can help show us what may happen to Earth in the future. Earth and Venus have very similar ""density and size"". But they are different in that the atmosphere is ""thick"" with ""97 percent carbon dioxide"" and the temperatures of the planet ""average 800 degrees farenheit"". The planet also contains ""highly corrosive sulfuric acid"" and an atmospheric pressure ""90 times greater"" that Earth. This is highly alarming that a planet so close to Earth can also be so different. This sparks a curiosity in the brains of many space passionate people. In culmination, the start of advanced space exploration starts with Venus. It is impossible to be unable to travel to Venus and expect to travel to other places in space. The author wants people to understand that exploring Venus is not pointless, but instead it can answer the many questions we have about our planet. Exploring venus is a challenge that people need to overcome. That is why the exploration of Venus starts a great leap in space exploration."
1102,0,"Why we should use our phones while driving Many may say that using cellphones while driving is dangerous and that the shouldn't be used while driving, but actually there are more pros than cons. You have apps now that let you use your phone while driving without actually touching your phone. Its pure fact that if not many but all teens that are in school and driving stress about school, life, etc. With students and people in general stressing, They may lead to hit and runs and cameras on phones can clearly help identify or capture the drivers or their licenses plate. While many may complain about how driving while using your phone is dangerous and this and that, they probably have been living under a rock for the past couple of years because there has been this new feature that has been around for a couple years now it called,hands-free feature. It lets you do about everything you would be capable of doing if you were actually touching and your phone. On the website ""drivingschool. net"", they stated that ""a hands free mobile phone can minimize such issue, allowing driver to make calls without taking their eyes off the road or their hands off the wheel."" Hit and Run drivers do exist. On the website ""newsroom. aaa. com"" they claimed that,"" Hit-and-Runs deaths in the US have increased an average of 7.2 percent each year since 2009."" The cameras on phones allow for drivers to take pictures of license plate numbers. In the past year its been reported that the percentage from 8% to 12% and those where from how many Hit-and-Runs where caught in only 2019. Yes, although many people have stated that teenagers get distracted while driving due to their phones its also proven that using phones while driving driving may be beneficial. People love to complaining and talk about how teenagers get distracted while driving due to their phones but they always bring up the irresponsible one or the more reckless ones as an example. There are people that drive perfectly fine and are capable of using their phones that exist. Many people don't like bringing those type of people up because they want to make a point. As i've been stating now this entire time, yes using your phone while driving may be beneficial but its also dangerous. So im not stating that you need to starting doing it always just when neccessary. Using your phone while driving may be useful but remember your safety comes first. 1"

7399,0,"Imagine that you are at our old middle school. There's a club that you are just dying to join, but you are too nervous to, One day, the principal comes onto the intercom and says: ""as of today, all students must be part of an extracurricular activity."" Finally, an excuse to join that club! This scenario is one that many students dream of, but a reality for few. Therefore, I believe that students should be required to participate in an extracurricular activity, as they can help to boost social skills, cope with depression, and develop new hobbies. First off, mandatory participation for extracurricular activities can help boost social skills for students. Many students suffer from social anxiety, and ""having any sort of extracurricular activity in a child's life can majorly boost the development of social skills due to working with others, especially in the 10-16 year old range,"" according to an article by psychologist Kathryn Wilson. This means that if children participate in extracurricular activities with peers, then they will most likely develop friendships with said peers. Another reason for enforcing mandatory participation for extracurricular activities is that they can help students cope with depression. Everybody has something they like to do, and there is almost always other people who enjoy the same thing. According to a study performed by Stanford University students in 2018, 93% of students who had been diagnosed with depression reported feeling ""happier and more energetic"" after spending time with people who had similar interests as them. This means that spending time with like-minded people can help students combat depression. Finally, participation in extracurricular activities should be mandatory because they can help students find new hobbies. For example, pretend that you are a student who has always wanted to fly a drone, but never has had the chance to. By joining a flight club, you could experience flying a drone, and possibly develop a new hobby! In fact, according to a survey done by Scholastic in 2017, 96 out of 100 students who joined a new club found out that they enjoyed the club! This means that 96% of students who joined a new club were able to find a new hobby. However, some people believe that extracurricular activities should not be mandatory. They say that some students prefer not to participate in an extracurricular activity. To test that, a group of William and Mary University students went to 3 different middle schools and asked every 8th grade student whether or not they would like participation in extracurricular activities to be mandatory. Afterwards, they took the 152 students who said no due to not wanting to have to participate in an extracurricular activity and asked them to join an extracurricular program of their choosing for one week. After the week, every single student who said that they did not want to participate in an extracurricular activity changed their minds. Ultimately, students should be required to participate in an extracurricular activity, as they can help to boost social skills, cope with depression, and develop new hobbies. After reading this, I strongly encourage you to go out and find a group of people with similar interests as you, be it online or in person. You might be surprised at how much you enjoy it!"

Our new high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from our Mars GLobal Survey spacecraft reveal the face on mars for what it really is. It is just a mesa. This is common on earth on the west side of the United States. Another reason it wasn't made from any alien or creature out there is because the moniters never found any monuments like that one and aliens moving around. For people who think aliens did this, say that our camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds which we couldn't see much, think the aliens were probably hiding. people who believe in aliens strongly are going to find the slightest detail and use that for their evidence. Since this was a popluar icon more and more people are going to lie and make up stuff to make sure people believe it is true. They already made up a lie that we would rather hide from the aliens. These people are called conspiracy theorists. The biggest proof we have that it wasn't made my aliens is our digital image. This was 3 times bigger than the pixel size. It would be able to see if there were objects in this picture like monuments or aliens. It could even see small shacks if there were any. Our spacecraft got to look at it a second time in 2001 and could see more better than the 1976 one. There was still nothing to be found but a natural landform. Even if we did catch aliens in our picture we showed the same picture to the public for all to see. Nobody said they found an alien structure. If we didn't detect neither would anybody else. This is why conspiracy theorists will always remain conspiraces. Because they have no soild evidence against us. We have acutul research to back us up. We kept looking at and studying it until we finaly came up with an answer to tell the world what it is."
22587,0,"Now technology is an essential part in everyday tasks, and is used to better the users life. Online classes are taken on the computer and students aren't required to come to physical school everyday. Online school is an excellent option and should be offered because it allows students to have more time to support their family, helps kids with medical issues get credits, and is more tailored to individual students needs. Teenagers have may tasks they need to accomplish outside of school but don't have enough time to dedicate themselves to it because school takes at least six hours of productive time out of their day. With the availability of online courses students can save their school work for a more convenient time to do it such as in the evenings. Many teenagers need to work long hours to help support their family. Since they don't have a degree yet they are only qualified for low paying jobs, which leads to the necessity of working more hours to make ends meet. Work soon takes priority over school and the teenagers drop out. This is seen more often in less affluent communities and with the help of online classes more students can continue to get work while still earning their GED. Many high schoolers have parents that work and younger siblings so the job to take care of them fall on their shoulders. Online classes opens up more time for high schoolers to be an active role model and caretaker for their family when they need them. High school students are struck with illnesses that hinder their ability to withstand attending school for long periods of time. Imagine having to go to six hours a day five days a week for nine months of the year while in pain. Online classes give ill students the opportunity to keep up with their school work in a manner more suitable for their needs. People with some diseases need to take medicine every hour and have side effects that could include nausea or fatigue which makes attending school very long and exhausting. Online school allows them to take classes from their own home or even the hospital. By being able to take classes in a comfortable setting they students will absorb more of the content because they won't have the setting of school to provide more obstacles for them. Another medical problem is brain development, many kids now pass average and above on school tests and other assignments, although there are a large number of teenagers who don't reach those levels because of learning challenges. They can't have a harder time keeping up with the pace and demand that a class can put on them because they are diagnosed with conditions such as dyslexia. Taking an online class will provide them the chance to put more time into a subject they are struggling in. The hour and 30 minutes of a class period every other day might not be enough time for them to fully grasp a concept. The students being able to choose the amount of time needed for them to understand the course lets them go at their own pace and is beneficial in the overall absorption of knowledge from the class. Now there are a wider variety of classes to take than there were 20 years ago. These classes are there to help give students a better understanding of future career falls and take more advanced classes to challenge themselves. However, there are required classes students have to be enrolled in and pass to earn a diploma. Many of these classes high school students take online to open up a slot on their schedule to participate in a class they are more interested in. Two common classes that kids take online are personal finance and P.E., they are classes kids take online so they can use the opening for more AP's or a stress reliever class such as art or yoga. Having the online option is helpful for kids so they can have more opportunities to participate in classes that will benefit them in their own ways. Online classes have many benefits but also some drawbacks. To be enrolled in the class costs money which deters many people away from taking those classes because they can't afford it. Online classes help people who need to use school time to go to work but if they have to pay to be enrolled in the class then it defeats the purpose of why they needed to take the class in the first place. Another issue that is seen with online classes is that it is easy for students to procrastinate their work and fall behind in a class and there is no physical teacher to tell them in person that changes need to occur. These are major problems with online classes but they don't outweigh the benefits because many people are successful when enrolled and continue to take them. Online school provides people the relief they need in their lives. Many high schoolers have complex needs and going to physical school doesn't fulfill them in the ways they require such as with their constraint on time, medical issues, and freedom of desired classes. Many more high schoolers have graduated coming out feeling more fulfilled and had been positively impacted by choosing to take an online class."
9085,0,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author suggest that studying Venus is worth it because we still dont have enough information to explain others about it. The people that go to it can gain more information, tell us how things are, how things move, and how they see things that are different from earth. One reason people should go to explore Venus it to discover how the weather is there. In the passage it said that ""Venus is one of the brightest point of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot."" This is not abnormal for a planet that is second from the sun. I imagine that it would be really hot because if earth is hot Venus is nine times more, which would be around 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Another reason is that you can go to venus to see how to surface is transformed. The scientist said ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supposted various forms of life, just like Earth."" This means you have the danger of stepping into something that you dont even know if its going to be ground or water with grass that makes it look like land. You can also be an danger because you dont know if the surface is really hot or cold. My final reason on how the author supports the idea stuying is worhty but danger is because People can check how techonology is there, or maybe if they have more advance technology then there is in Earth. For example it said "" Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers"" That gives them an idea of how smart technology was in Venus. Another example was "" Modern computers are enormouslwy powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical condition."" This means that the technology is good it just depends on the nature things like weather. Those are reason on why the author suggest why people should go visit Venus although it might be dangerous, People also want to learn more about it but we dont have enough information because people dont go explore Venus."
24406,0,"Would you learn better by taking online classes at home? Many children are home schooled for different reasons and take online classes to complete their education. Yet, most students perfer to attend school to accomplish and to better understand their education coming from a real teacher. Students would benefit better from attending school in a building enviroment because students are able to communicate with each other, better access to educational resources, and a understanding of subjects by attending classes. When going to school, you are able to socialize with friends and fellow classmates to better your education. Many students benefit from communicating with other students because they can help each other out with assignments. For example, I was in history class and when we were given an group assignment to complete by the following week. I decided to partner up with one of my classmates and we used our knowledge to get the work done. By working hard, plus rationalizing our work we were able to finish the assignment a day early. By working together, we were able to use our heads to pass the assignments with flying colors. Having the chance to socialize with other students help create a better educational enviroment for the students. This results in better grades and student involvement during school hours. Some assignments can be hard to complete by yourself without any help. When taking online classes, you have no access to teacher references or input. For instance, I was having trouble with a math assignment and I couldn't figure out what to do. I tried using the internet, notes from my class, and textbooks from school; yet, they still didn't help me how to figure out the assignment. I asked my teacher one morning, before the assignment was due, to help me understand the work properly. She guided me through every problem and answered my question of uncertainty. By math class, I turned in the assignment complete and my grade came back with a perfect score. When attending school, teachers are there to help you at any time. They are resources that you can't get from anywhere else. By using them as resources, you are highly to get a good grade and understand the information more efficiently. By attending school, you enter class with a teacher in the room explaining the lesson. While the teacher is teaching; she gives you tools on how to understand the material properly. Thus, the teacher is giving you tips and tricks to have the information and on how to use that information wisely. For example, I was in math class and we were about to learn a new lesson. During the lesson, the teacher gave many short cuts and tricks on how to understand the material more effectively. After the lesson, she gave us worksheets to practice some problems to understand the information. I used the tricks she showed us and was able to do the exercises without a problem. When going to school, you are exposed to new material in a classroom. By being exposed to this new material, you are able to understand the information being given better with the tips and tricks the teacher is showing you. Does attending school help you better benefit you in your education? Many students attend school because they want a good education. They want a good foundation to help them prepare themselves for the future. Having the exposure to an educational enviroment helps them get the tools they need to support themselves in real life. Thus, giving students a benefit to secure a good profession and be ready for independent life."
4523,0,"Students are stuck doing summer assignments during their vacation. Various teachers give students assignments to do on their break and these kids have no time to enjoy it. If summer assignments are student-designed rather than teacher-designed, students are able to enjoy their summer vacations and be able to show what they know and what creativity they hold. Although some may believe otherwise, creativity, diversity of projects, and comprehensibility of the concept proves that summer projects should be student-designed. One reason why summer projects should be student-designed is the creativity of the project. Instead of one strict guideline for the projects, students can get creative and go above and beyond and be able to put more effort into them. A science teacher gave all of his students a project on the idea of photosynthesis. The kids had to color in a picture of a cell that he provided and label the parts of the cell. When the school year began, the teacher failed all of his kids as they showed ""no creativity"". If his students were able to design their own projects, then creativity would have been present. On another case, my friend and I were given a summer assignment where we had to respond to a prompt that the teacher had given. The prompt was boring and every student wrote similar essays and lacked major creativity according to the head of the English department. We were barely given enough time to write our essays as the prompt had come out late. If the groups were able to chose their own prompts, the kids would be able to put more effort to make a creative, persuasive essay and be given ample time to write them. Another reason as to why summer project should be student-designed is behind the comprehensibility of the concept. Students will be able to show what they know and understand instead of letting the teacher decide what they should know or understand. Teachers like to know what their upcoming students understand about the subject via their projects. It was difficult for my teacher to grasp what the students knew as he had put out one parallel structure and everyone followed one same principle. If the students were able to design their own projects, they would be able to show more of what they know. Another example is where my friends math teacher had let them design their own projects and make up problems and solve them. Each student had turned in something unique and were able to show the teacher what they knew while having enough time to finish as they were able to work around their vacations. One may say that if these projects are teacher-designed, there will be one organized structure. As this may seem true, teachers aren't able to get proper data on what the student knows and how creative a student can get. Teachers need to know what their students are capable of doing and if they can't gather the proper data, then they won't know. One may even say that if the projects are teacher-designed it would be easier for the teacher to grade. If that's true, then if projects are student-designed it would be easier for the students to do them. The quality would be better and students would be able to create a project around the free time they have as they have pre-planned vacations and events. Thus, summer projects should be student-designed to show the creativity of the student, diversity of the projects, and comprehensibility of the concept the students can grasp. Families have planned vacations for the summer over a year in advance, and teachers shouldn't throw the obstacle of following a strict guideline for a summer project and ruin their vacation. If the student is able to design their project, then they can get creative, show their knowledge, and have the time to make a project while enjoying their vacation."
22768,0,"With the rise of technology attending classes from home, by video conferencing and/ or online, would benefit students tremendously. Although face to face teaching would allow student to obtain more hands on learning, schools should offer students the option of distance learning because it would accommodate to student's needs and personal lives, result in better class attendance, and allow students to learn at their own pace. To begin, allowing students the opportunity to attend class from home would lead to better class attendance. This option does not only benefit the students but the school as well. Schools are commonly ranked by their attendance levels of students, with this program it would boost the school's entire reputation. Students would benefit because in instances where a student has to miss school due to difficult situations, such as an illness or family issues, and are unable to come everyday would give the opportunity to attend school without being in the facility. Students may also have difficulty making the commute to the school building everyday, with the option of distance learning students who may live greater distances from the school building will still be able to get their education without traveling becoming an obstacle. Due to these reasons, schools should offer the option of distance learning to all students. Additionally, with the option of distance learning would accommodate to student needs. Many students find distractions like loud noises and talking very disruptive, making it unable for these students to properly learn and pay complete attention to what is being taught. Therefore, for these students to have the option to learn from home would let these students get the most out of the education. As well as, this program would work with the hectic schedules of students and their families. Letting students, even through activities and extracurriculars be able to access school work without having to deal with pounds of make up work and tutoring sessions afterwards. Making it much easier for students to maintain their personal priorities while receiving an education. In conclusion, with the accommodation to students needs will make adolescent education more accessible. Furthermore, distance learning would help students learn at their own pace. Nobody has the same learning patterns as their fellow classmates, so distance learning will make it eligible for students to work at separate tempos to accommodate their preferences. Like previously stated, with students working at different speeds, at home working will decrease the distractions students face while trying to study and take notes. Overall, learning, via video conferencing or online, would help students more likely understand learning materials and work to their needs. In conclusion, distance learning would be a great addition to any school system because of the accommodation to student needs, allowing students learn at their own pace, and maintaining higher class attendance. These benefits would improve students academic scores and how much students grow in their education. Distance learning could make it much easier for a student to excel in life and aim higher in their academic goals."
10087,0,i dont relly see a use for that i mean what whoul you use it for if kids are mad its not thats hard to see if there mad or not why would we need an computer to do it for us when we can do it ourselfs and i dont know how much money it would cost but i imagan it would be a lot and for what telling us if a kid is mad i understand for reserch pouposis but not for really anything diffrent. now that i read the passage even further now i see some more use of the computer for kids that do not want to ask for help and they just sit there all confused and dont do anything about it the teacher can go up to them and ask if they need help maby in like a big collage becuse i dont think school computors could handle it like they say in the passage our computors at home could not handle the complex agrithomes and i dont think a lot of schools have the money to do that
4771,0,"When students hear the sound of the bell on the last day of school, all they can think about is their excitement for the summer. Most students instantly forget all of the information they had just recently learned and are mainly looking forward to the time they're going to get in the sun. Although, recently teachers have been searching for an effective way to to eliminate the forgetfulness students portray during the summer. They are striving for their students to continue to learn, rather than taking a three month break. Teacher-designed assignments are the most efficient way to enforce summer learning because it assures equal project difficulty, and sets students up for their future correctly. Equality in project difficulty is critical when asking students to learn during their summer break. Teachers understand that there are different types of students. There are kids who work hard, and then kids who take short cuts. By allowing students to design their own summer projects, many would take the easy way out. They would create a project that requires minimum work and effort. I once had a math teacher who made an assignment optional for my class, although the other math teacher in the department made her students' assignment required. As predicted, many people in my class didn't even attempt the assignment. These students took the short cut and did not reach their full potential. However, every single student who had the other teacher learned a lot from that project. This is a perfect example of why teachers should be creating summer assignments, and not the students. By giving students a choice, many will look for the easiest way. In order to keep a class united it is important that they are all given the same task. This takes away the chance of students cutting corners and creating an easy project that they don't gain any knowledge from. Teachers have the ability to keep their students learning, and in sync, by assigning the same project difficulty to everyone. Another reason summer projects should be teacher-designed is because it assures students will be learning the correct material to prepare them for the future. Teachers have a great understanding of the educational pathway students experience, and can successfully prepare them for what's to come. For example, a student isn't aware of everything he or she will learn throughout the year in science, although, the teacher does. Therefore, the teacher will then set up the year's units to build off of each other, in order to simplify the learning process. This also applies to summer assignments because the teacher knows what students will be learning in your next year of school, even though the student doesn't. When a teacher designs a project, he or she will make it so that the information prepares kids for the future. It would be useless to spend three months learning about something that might never be encountered again. A student could easily create an assignment that won't prepare them for years to come because they lack specific knowledge a teacher has. Ultimately, teachers have the ability to keep their students on a pathway to success that students might not understand yet. Even though there are many reasons why teacher-designed projects would be successful, some many say that there are advantages to student-designed projects. Some people believe that allowing a student to create their own summer assignment will create a sense of independence. They might think that kids will be better prepared for the future when they have to do things on their own. Although, not all students are quite ready for complete independence yet. A student's schooling years is a time for learning and growing. When faced with the large challenge of creating a project, many will get flustered and ultimately not perform well. Many students will also get confused and not fully understand the topic that the project should be on. There have been many times where a rubric or set of directions have helped guide me through specific projects. Helping students is what teachers do best, therefore we should allow them to do their job. When the ultimate job in to learn, it is vital that we choose the best learning technique. Student-designed assignments may seem to have a few decent advantages, although in the end teacher-designed assignments advantages greatly overpower. In conclusion, there are a lot of factors to consider when deciding the best way for a student to learn. When looking at a summer assignment, it is important to understand the best way to get students engaged. They need to be learning relevant information, and keeping up with their work during the fun months of summer. Considering the maturity level and knowledge of a student, it would not be the best decision to allow them to create a summer assignment. A teacher-designed assignment would assure learning during the break because it assures equal project difficulty, and sets students up for their future correctly."
16342,0,"Dear TEACHER_NAME, I feel that it is inappropriate to have a average grade of a B in all classes to participate in all school athletics. Most students have an average grade of a C. The reason that this is probably happening is because the schools overall grade is low but their must be something that can be done so that you can have an average of a C to be in sports because many kids would have to quit sports that they love just because they are having to go above an average student. Many kids do sports at our school and that is why we win so many tournaments but if many of those students have a test average of a C then Farnell will loose their reputation and the students will blame you. If students are required to have a grade average that high many students may transfer to different schools or find different teams to join. So just by raising the grade average it wont do anything their will just be less kids participating in student athletics at our school. Most students have an equal balance between homework and practicing for games and going outside but if the grade average is higher then they` re will be less kids playing outside because they will struggle to get good grades then they will be kicked off their teams because they haven't been practicing enough. So in my opinion the average grade for sports should be a C or up. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME"
120,0,"Drivers shouldn't be able to text and drive. If you look at recent studies, you'll see that vehicular accidents have gone down in the last couple of years due to no strict ""no texting while driving"" laws. The reason for this is because once you get rid of the distracting handheld screen, your proficiency increases. Drivers that's always distracted by a mobile device could cause a road rage or even a big accident to the public. It isn't caring is could be highly dangerous for you and for the people around you, including the environment. This could also increase every chance of you getting pulled over by the cops if you're unlucky. A driver's attention should solely be on the road. Their focus is already easily split by passengers, and even so with the recreational use of cellular devices. To drive, is to invite danger and risk into your life tenfold. Apparatuses like phone stands on bluetooth functionality are both proper substitutes that reduce the risk and danger of using your cell phone while driving. All in all, unless the proper measures are taken, cellular devices shouldnt be used while driving. To say that there is a time devices should be used, maybe should be only for gps for navigation. Other than that Devices in a hand of a driver should be prohibited and forced to drive safely to their desired destination harm free. Getting caught being on a device while driving can be very treacherous, being pulled over can result in multiple tickets and will lower your credit score and that isn't so good. That goes to say driving comes with many responsibilities. That one second where you think it is safe to pull out your phone, can be that one second later you're in the hospital. Driving can lead to serious injuries driver of any should not take focus off the road to take part in activity that doesn't have to do with what's in front of them. Studies shows 1,2 million people die every year in car crashes between the ages 15-44. So while driving take your mind of the device and start driving right, always remember that a phone will go nowhere but a life will. Reasoning on no devices while driving is part of the law, and should be obeyed by any means. Obviously taking a call while driving or answering a text could be severe for you and either for others that's on the road. The awareness of you not focusing on the road can lead to jail time as well, texting and driving is illegal and if your record is bad you may go to jail for such a little thing that can cause a big problem. People may cherish their phones like their life may depend on it but not focusing can put someone else's life in grave danger/"
1572,0,"A world without cars is kind of hard to imagine right? Well not for most countreis anymore. Cars are becoming less and less desirable as the years go on. The peak was in 2005 and then has been slowly decreasing. Younger people like the ideas of cars but don't really need one. New York has subways, taxi's, and others are carpooling to destinations. France has alreayd issued a ban on cars and has even had certain cars banned on certain days. For instance, even number car plates could not be used for driving on Monday's, odd number plates were banned for Tuesday's. This was to help reduce the amount of smog in the French air as they rely mostly on diesel rather than gas. In Vauban, Germany street parking, driveways and home garages have been banned from neighborhoods. You could now only buy a house with a garage for $40,000. This cause more people to stop using cars, and others to sell them to live in the upscale neighborhoods. Many of the Ford and Mercedes car dealerships are considering changing their train of car producing to the newer ideal of intertiwning public transportation with the up and coming ideas of bikers on the rodes, and people using buses and subways instead of their own cars. In Paris the smog in the air was soon thicker than it was in Beijing, China the citied known for its polluted air. Soon Parisian officials enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the smog. Monday's, motorists with even-numbered plates had been ordered to leave their cars at home or get a 22-euro fine, which is also $31. The same requirements were set in place for odd-numbered plates the following day. The first time this new ban was enforced nearly 4,000 dirvers were fined. Some even had their cars impounded for thier reaction to the new fine. The amount of traffic was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after the five days of an intensifying smog. The smog was caused by cold nights and warm days that caused the warmer layer of air to trap the car emissions. Diesel fuel was, of course, blammed as France has a tax policy for diesel fuel over gassoline. 67 percent of vehicles in Frane, compared to the 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe. Paris would typically have more smog than the other European countries with the percentage of diesel fule they use daily. Paris had 147 micrograms of diesel per cubic meter last week compared to 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London. Delivery companies lost revenue, but this starte an exception for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Soon the smog had cleared anouth on Monday for the ruling French party to take away the ban for odd-numbers plates on Tuesday. The United States has long since been one of the world's prime car cultures. President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse has emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitious assist from a incipient shift in American behavior."
17071,0,"My approach on drivless cars is, everything works perfectly, the car coudln't get better than that. It has sensors to notify you that there is an accident ahead, or a road blocik ahead. I got the following details from the passage. I would honestly buy one, it seems much, safer than the average car. When you drive the average car now people tend to get drunk and reckless drive. But the Driverless car prevents that because there are alot sensors. I would rather drive the Driverless Car because it is much safer for younger drivers. The whole entire car is like a human steering the wheel, I read this part in the passage. "" The combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel."" So the car is like a professional driver. Drunk drivers would be safer driving the driverless car, instead of a 2012 Impala. The driverless car is a much safer car for the community. I have came to my conclusion that the driverless car is safer than an average car. The driverless car can steer itself, the driverless car has driven more than half a million miles without crashing, and the driverless car mimics the skill of a human at the wheel. So the driverless car couldn't be more safer. The driverless car should honestly have alot of buyers because it's a good idea, I would rather have my son safe then sorry between driving an average car and an perfectly tested Driverless Car. It just seems alot more safer, I honestly think with all the upragdes it needs it is definitley worth it."

Seagoing Cowboys program is a program where you go out on a big boat and you go on the seas and travel to different crountries. I am first going to tell you why you should go. You should go to the program because you get to see all different kind of countries like Greece, China, and Europe. Why would you not want to go to different countries. Other people might say it's way to dangerous because you might run out of food or the boat might sink and you might get lost while you are out in the seas. You will not run out of food because the person who is encharge packs 6 months of food. If the boat does sink, there will be another boat behind us. You will not get lost because there will be other people there with you and there will be maps. When you get to a country like Venice,Italy there will be a city with streets of water so we can stay in the boat. What you can see at the different countries is where people live, what kind of houses does the people live in, and you will be aloud to take pictures so you will never forget your time at the countries and the boat. So that is why you should go to the Seagoing Cowboys program. You will have alot fun while you will be on the trip. So make sure you pack alot of clothes and pack your bag for a avdevture."
13685,0,"Principal, Hello, I have notice you are thinking about requiring all students to perform community service. Some might agree with you because our community needs to be taking care of. On the other hand, others might degree because they believe community service takes too much time away from what they need or want to do. I would like to tell you why i believe that you should be required to perform community service. Some agree that the community service is needed because we need to take care of our community. It is very important to take care of the community. If we don't then our community would have litter all over the ground, elementary children need help and if we are not willing to help them then not good grades would be on their report cards. We don't have a lot of people helping in our community services so we need more helpers but the people we do have doesn't regret helping out and serving their job. Other students however, believes that community service takes too much time away from things they want and need to do. Now a lot of students play sports and homework and etc. but maybe on days that they don't have anything to do or they have extra time they can service the community. Only if it is only an hour at the soup kitchen, I'm sure they wouldn't mind helping out even if it isn't a lot of time. I believe that students should be required to perform community service because we need to clean up on community and help out. It doesn't matter if it is just an hour or if it is five hours, students need to learn to help out with the surroundings around us. I strongly believe that students need to be required because they will see the fun and great feeling of taking care of the community. Thank you for taking your time and reading this letter. I hope you understand my thoughts about your decision. Take care, fellow students."
21541,0,"Dear Principal, I would very greatly consider policy #1. Students should be allowed to use their cell phones in school. If there is an emergency at home and no one can come to the school to get the student, someone could call their cell phone. It would also be better because students could talk to their friends from different classrooms if they didn't have a hall pass. If students could use their phones they could go home with friends if they didn't have a ride home. The student could text their parents and tell them to call the school for permission to ride home with a friend. The student could also text or call their friend to ask if they could go home with them. The only bad part in policy #1 is that phones should be turned of during class time. Phones should be on during class so the student could use it during an emergency. Even some of the teachers have their phones turned on during class. If the teachers can have their phones on then the students should have their phones on too. There are many reasons for phones being allowed in school and these are some of those reasons."
3815,0,"Summer is here! Students and teachers are out of school; they are on vacations, visting family, or being with friends! But what about retaining information from the past year, or learning new information, all while you are doing all of your favorite summer activities? Some schools require summer projects during the summer break so that students have an oppurtunity to continue learning over the summer. The summer projects that are completed by students should be student-designed because, it lallows for the student to be more creative and have fun! When given the oppurtunity to do a project, students are more likely to complete a project that is based on their creativity. For example, if the student is on an international vacation and left with very little supplies, that student will be forced to be resourceful with his/her resources. With that being said, instead of making the projects teacher-designed, and risking a less creative and boring project, the projects should be student-designed. This will allow the students to come up with their own way of presenting their newly found information through their own creativity with his/her resources. Student-designed projects give the oppurtunity to make learning fun! A student who is researching information should have a good time while learning the neccessary information to complete to school-required project. For example, if the student is on vacation at a beach, researching information about the ocean, they might go to the beach and explore the natures (all while enjoying their vacation)! The student will not have to stress about finishing their summer project when they get back from their vacation. Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? Some might believe that teachers should design the projects so they are more structured and relevent to what they are trying to teach. But, making these projects student-designed, it would make the project more enjoyable for the student, allowing them to be more creative, and have fun!"
6687,0,"I think it is a good idea to have students participate in extracurricular activity's. It would be a great chance for them to learn new stuff or they might have had it for a hobby so that is why they would like to pick it. If they like to try new things then that's a good reason to let them pick it randomly. Not all of them will go to the one they wanted, so when they go to a different one they might like it more than the one they wanted to go to first. I agree that students should go to a extracurricular activity because it could tech them about responsibility, they could teach their other sibling(s), could help them get a career. When you go to Art class it is fun but your responsibly is to cleaning your area, brushes, pallet, and your hands after you are done panting. If you want to go to Ag. you get to learn ancient buildings, animals, and plants, your responsibility is to get there on time and do all the work the teacher hands you. When you go to Family and Consumer Science you cook, clean, and learn how to sew, you have a few responsibilities they are keeping your work space clean and making sure that everything is where it is suppose to be. In Technology class you can make your own book marks and make funny memes, your responsibility is to stay be on the sit(s) you are suppose to be on and to follow instructions. secondly If you don't really like your extracurricular class that much and your younger sibling does then you could show your younger sibling how and what to do. Say that you and your sibling whether they are younger or older then you, tell them what you are doing in class and then you could both do it together and have fun. If you are an only child you can tell your friends what you have been doing in your class and they might tell you what they've been doing in their class, you can teach each other what you've been doing in class. If your parents and siblings like the extracurricular class that you are in then you could tell your family all about it and show them what you have been learning too. They could use the skills they learned from their favorite extracurricular class and use it to get a job. You can take Art if you want to become an artist or a photographer. You go to Technology class to learn about computers that could be your job in the future. You can take Music if you want to become a musician or a violinist in an orchestra. When you go to architecture (Ag.) you could build houses and towers or you could do landscaping and fix peoples gardens when you're old enough to do it."
23955,0,"Many people believe that students benefit from working at home rather than at school. Opinions may vary as there are many pros and cons for students when it comes to online school. Some schools may not have a choice due to the overcrowding of students. But, students should not consider taking classes online because it will not give students an opportunity to socialize among peers, it will not give students structure compared to what they would get in school, and students won't be able to get hands on help on struggling assignments. Socializing among peers is very important, especially among teens. Friends are a big part of a students life as they provide a sort of happiness and gratification. An example of this is when a student decided that he wanted to take all of his classes online, thinking that it would make life a lot easier. What he didn't realize is the fact that he wouldn't have anyone to talk to during the day. While all his friends are at school, having conversations, he was at home by himself. Due to this problem, he then decided that it was a mistake and went back to school the following year. Many studies have shown that socializing among peers is very beneficial for ones mental health. Having someone to talk to and be there for you is very beneficial. If a student is taking online school the only thing they are talking to or looking at is a screen. Hopefully, students take this into consideration when deciding either to stay in school or stay at home and take online school. Structure is a key part of the amount of success a student will have in their academics. Schools provide this with teachers and how they make sure that a student is working up to his/her potential. About a year ago, there was a student at Generic_School that was a certified delinquent. This student barely showed up to class and his grades clearly represented it. Consequently, a teacher took her time and effort to try and get him on the right path. In time, it worked and the student is a lot more successful because this teacher gave him the structure that he needed and something he wouldn't have gotten online. Let's face it, if a student takes classes online, he/she won't give the same amount of effort they would normally due to no one keeping them in check. Staying home the entire day would give a student the thought of ""hey, just do this later"". That's the type of mindset a student will have if they take online school. Success isn't just the amount of effort a student puts in, but also the structure built around them. Lastly, the amount of help a student can receive in school rather than online school is enormous. Having a teacher be there to help at anytime is something a student won't be able to receive online. Online school does provide students with help but it isn't the same as having someone hands on. An example of this is online Econ and Finance compared to in class Econ and Finance. A student must take this class in order to graduate and some may consider it easy, others may not. It isn't a very easy class and many students need help understanding it. Comparing finals scores between a online student and a in class student showed that the in class student understood more due to the amount of help she received from the teacher. Another argument is that students are given an opportunity to stay after school to get help on struggling assignments, something a student can't get online. After school help has helped many students finally understand the work given and given them a chance to be successful. If a student is having trouble online, they would most likely Google it and that isn't as reliable as a teacher. The help a student can get in school is incomparable to anything else. In conclusion, online school will not benefit a student. Maybe there are pros, such as getting more sleep or having a quiet environment, but the amount of pros that come from regular school is insurmountable. Students should not consider taking classes online because it will not give students an opportunity to socialize among peers, it will not give students structure compared to what they would get in school, and students won't be able to get hands on help on struggling assignments. Hopefully students think this decision through and make sure that he/she makes the right one."
10581,0,"How amazing would it be if you were able to detect exactly how other people are feeling? It would be great, would it not? Well, with new software called the Facial Action Coding System, you are able to do just that. The use of this technology could be extremely valuable to students in a classroom. This software has classified six basic emotions-happiness,surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Having stated this, this software can inform teachers on how their students are feeling. In paragraph 6 of the article, it states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" If teachers know exactly how their students are feeling, they can provide better aid. This is only possible if the Facial Action Coding System is implemented in schools. Although, we can probably tell how a student is feeling simply by the look on their face, it is not as effective as using this software. Teachers do no have the time to be guessing how their students are feeling. It would waste too much time. If this technology would be implemented in schools, teachers would be able to help more students in a more efficient mannner. The implementation of this technology in schools would be amazing, hands down. Not adopting this technology would be an ignorant choice. Knowing what students are struggling in would be made easy. Also, teachers would be able to provide aid to more students than before. Its benefits outweigh any negatives that might be present."

6994,0,"Hey, Today I am going to convince readers that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I agree that students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because, they are fun and helpful. It can be fun by, playing games with your friends and other fun stuff you can think about. It can also be helpful by being a leader, if you want to do sports you can become stronger and more healthier, and the activities you do can also benefit your life in the future, for an example my dad said when he was little he really didnt play sports but when he start liking sports he started to get stronger and so now he gets paid for playing football in the NFL. And to be honest it not all about sports in this reading because other activities like serving in the student council and working on the yearbook can get you to good places academic wise like a good college and a good job. One time me and my friends was doing art for an activity and a famous painter came and gave the three of us free passes to take drawing lessons with him, all of us was so excited! See look if we would have never did the activity we would have never got those free lessons and now we might become famous painters/drawers. There are a lot of other activities but my favorite activity is cooking because cooking can take you a lot of places in the world and I love to eat. There are about 93% of people that cook in the World and thats a lot of people. You can even use cooking for yourself and others. You can use cooking for yourself by cooking for yourself like how are you going to survive without eating and if you cook for yourself than you can save money by not paying for other food. Did you know that you can even get paid for cooking for other people? You can work at a restaurant or you can even own a restaurant. Either way you can make money or save money and money is good. I hope that you have made a destion on doing an extracurricular activity. I already gave you the options its just now based on your opinion. TRUST ME YOU WILL NOT REGREAT IT."
22920,0,"Do you get tired of consistently waking up early every morning just to attend school? The school system has a way of impacting individual's lives simply due to the fact of a set schedule. Physically coming to school should not be the focus of presenting your educational learning skills, because anyone can be present in class and not do their work. This generation is dependent more so on others rather themselves, therefore, kids don't understand or really know what they are capable of doing on their own. Students not only have responsibilities during school, but outside of school as well. Being able to take online classes allows students to demonstrate responsibility, accomplishments, and a chance to give back to their community. You ever sit back and realize how much work you have to get done within the day at that moment in time? Being able to work independent shows a lot of responsibility and maturity. Education is not something kids take lightly, because it depends on our future outcome. Taking into consideration the responsibilities outside of school and inside school comes with a lot of independence and organization. Likewise, the amount of stress upon students impact their ability to get all of their work done. Therefore, with the chance to take your classes at home presents a different outcome. With this outcome: Students can now manage their day with all of the other responsibility's they have to take care of. Some may say, simply by going to school in a classroom setting shows enough courage and ownership by just being there. However, demonstrating that you can manage a life without being present in a school environment, and get your work done show tremendous responsibility. Due to reasoning, students who work from home allows minors to work comfortably and plan ahead of time of what needs to be done. We all feel a burst of happiness and excitement when we accomplish something that has been a heavy burden for us; In this case, school. Students have tons of work to get done with a short time span, so once that work consistently piles up from class to class you become backed up. On the other hand, you are the only one who knows what works for you in your learning environments, so as you try to absorb new information from your subject you can do so manually on your time. Now it has been said that if students work from home they won't actually do their work. However, majority of the time kids experience difficult comprehension in certain subjects, so they feel as if there is no point in learning it themselves. Furthermore, students feel as if they can feed off of their peers to help them get through the unit which always isn't the case. Now that you have a convent time block for work you can get it done feeling accomplished and happy that you don't have to procrastinate. The last reason students should part take in learning from home is because it presents a opportunity for teens to get out there and give back to the greater good. Majority of the older populations doubt the younger generation in what we are capable of accomplishing. They feel as if it is too much for us to handle. However, truth be told we are the common grounds for our lives. For example, you are the type of person who loves to help other's out, and there is a volunteering experience to go feed and clothe the homeless families. On top of that this volunteering experience rewards with a 1,000 scholarship. However, you have to go to school for a upcoming test, and now you miss the chance to be apart of a great experience and benefit from a scholarship. Likewise, what some fail to realize: is that if students are constantly backed up and stressed out from school work it leaves no time to obtain new information, or simply be apart of a big impact that's exciting and important to you. People believe that minors will have the rest of their time here on earth to experience new things. However, we all have to start somewhere and for us it is throughout our life time in growing up. Not being able to participate in meaningful activities may in fact leave you empty handed with a void that is not filled. As a result, you miss out on a opportunity that may later set you back from your dreams and goals. With all being said: Schools should present the opportunity for students to take online classes, because it promotes responsibility, accomplishments, and a chance to give back. With this greater change, students can now prove to themselves what they are capable of achieving just with the matter of time. In fact, students have to make it their mission to stay on task at home which also increases the chances of exceeding well on quizzes, tests, and other assignments. Retaining the information teachers give out, but expanding on it the way you want to learn is a great technique on remembering the concepts of that unit. This opportunity will have a positive impact for those who do not do well in a school environment or simply need things to be done within their time."

Though Venus itself is denser and hotter than Earth, both planets are one in the same. The author of the passage utilizes this in explaining as to why investing into the research of this particular planet in the Milky Way is worth it. The author does this by comparing Venus to Earth within Venus's geometric structures as well as its weather patterns. Venus can be said to be Earth's twin. Known as the second planet from the sun, Venus was once like how our planet is today based on scientists' knowledge. According to the passage the planet,""...(W)as probably covered largely with oceans..."". Earth contains 70% of water and has life on it and with this quote describing that Venus had water at one point in time, it too might have supported life forms which is what the author is attempting to explain in his writings. Like Earth, Venus obtains the same landformations. Another detail provided from the article states,""...surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters"" indicating not only that this planet once held water but, also sustains land structures identicle to Earth's. In the final section of paragraph 3 it enscribes,""...(G)eology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerfull earthquakes, and...lighting strikes..."". Along with the planets identicle features to Earth's, It also features weather patterns and conditions that are compatible too. Combining all of this information, Venus can be idealized as Earth. The author gets to the point by comparing the various landforms, weather, and natural disasters of the two space rocks. Researching Venus could not only mean furthering the understanding of this particular planet but, also Earth too. Lastly, continuing the study on Venus is so vital that by doing so, man could possibly land another planet."

If there is a way to reconstruct the society of our country, then why not do it? Well is would be an outstanding achievement, but it would require a lot of time and work. Therefore, it would cut time from sports, education, music, and spending time with friends and family. In this case I believe that students should not be forced into community service to help make our nation a better place. To start this idea off, many students are already lugging themselves to help form a better civilization. The United States is not a catastrophe, and many other countries have corrupt governments and humans living on streets and in their cars. I believe that the nation's idea of setting up homes for our citizens is already an enhancement for our magnificent nation. Many adults rather are looking for jobs in our nation. Perhaps, if adults were payed for their labor, it would increase employment rate and make our kingdom a better place to live. Students who are willing to perform in community services should definitely have the privileges to do as they wish. For example, I play tennis three to four times a week, play golf, play the piano, the drums, and know French. I perform these activities, not only for my pleasure, but also to make a nice beginning for my near future. I also am a member of the California Junior Scholarship Federation. I help our society in dealing with people in need, cleaning up our environment, and much more. If I were to take some time off from my activities and put time into helping our community, it would make this world a better place, but it would also clip the ends off of my goals. All in all, they are definitely many conflicts that people in America face daily, but once again, other areas in our world face conflicts that are mush major. To my opinion, students should not be forced to do community service."
14619,0,"Dear Principal, I do not believe that you should make all kids do community service, and there are many reasons I believe this. First of all, most kids would object to doing this because it is too much work. All kids think school is to much work to begin with. Speaking of school, it would cut away at our school time too much. if we were all to do an hour of community service within school hours, it would be to much time taken away, near 20 hours each month, almost 3 entire school days wasted. My third and final point is that there is little to do. after a week of community service, almost all the litter everywhere would be picked up. Not to mention there's no town of just old ladies trying to cross the street. This is why I believe that it is a bad idea to require all students to perform community service. Please consider my letter when you decide whether or not to make this final."

The Seagoing Cowboys program is amazing you get to go to all of these beautiful places. The whole point of it is too help take care of animals, people, and even help built their houses (In Europe for know). The reason for that is, because the World War II just got done in Europe and everything is ruined there and we can help them. That's why we have the Seagoing Cowboys program to help what has been ruined in countrys. This is a good experience to help and see knew things. We're traveling on sea (I hope know one is sea sick) and the cattle boats are unbelievble. While we are going to help people you get to go past China, Italy and more places. This is a very amazing opportunity and I hope you do the right thing and sign up. In this program you can save peoples lives and make them happy. Also you can see some pretty amazing things, and you can learn new things. I really hope you join. Thanks for reading! Bye!"
6573,0,"Most people you know probably participate in some form of an extracurricular activity. Whether it be sports, a school club, theatre, or something else, almost all of us have participated in an extracurricular at some point in our lives. Extracurricular activities have many benefits, such as an opportunity to do something you enjoy, which will make you happier and help you relieve stress, and an opportunity to meet new people who share your interests. However, some people may argue that extracurricular activities take away time that they don't have, but there's a solution for that. I agree with the principle's decision to have everyone participate in an extracurricular activity because there are many benefits that come from participating in them. Extracurricular activities are a great way to do something you enjoy. There are many different things to do which means that there is something for everyone. Having the opportunity to be participating in something you enjoy will make you happier. It has been proven that when you're happier, you have lower stress levels. When asked, 9 out of 10 students said that they felt stressed by school often. An extracurricular activity is a great way to relieve some of that stress. By participating in something you enjoy and something you chose to do, you'll be able to improve your skills, which can give you a sense of accomplishment and happiness. These are just some of the benefits of an extracurricular activity. Extracurricular activities are also a great way to meet new people. There are people that come from all different backgrounds, that you may not have classes with at school, that may be in different grades, or that you may have never known without participating in an extracurricular activity. These new people will share the same interests as you which is a great way to be able to do things together and it gives you an opportunity to be able to learn from each other. By being in an extracurricular activity where you get to meet these new people, you'll have an opportunity to hang out with them on a regular basis when you may not have been able to do that any other time. These are just some of the other many benefits that an extracurricular activity can bring. There are some people who may argue against everyone having to participate in an extracurricular activity. They may say that they don't have the time to participate and if they do then they won't get their school work done. However, other people who participate in extracurricular activities get their work done on time which means that there are ways to do so. You also won't have that activity every single day which means that it won't inflict on your everyday life. If you're worried about not having time to get work done, you can focus really hard during your study hall period to get more work done, you can get up earlier in the mornings to get extra work done, and you can even do work on your way to or from the activity, or to and from school in the mornings and afternoons. You may also argue that there are no extracurricular activities that are offered that you want to participate in. However, there is such a wide variety of things to do at most schools that there is something everyone can enjoy. However if there isn't something you would want to participate in, most schools will help you create a new club that you can recruit people for and run with a teachers help. Even if people want to argue against this new rule, there are solutions to their complaints. Overall, there are many benefits to participating in extracurricular activities. You get to do something you enjoy, you get to meet new people, you'll be happier, and although people may find ways to argue against the new requirements, the good outweighs the bad. There are plenty of options at most schools so that everyone can find something that they enjoy. There are plenty of different sports, there are debate clubs, the student council, yearbook committee, the school newspaper, theatre, and clubs for almost any interest someone may have. In conclusion, I agree fully with the principal's new decision and I believe that everyone should participate in some type of extracurricular as well."

Right when they started to leave to europe world war 2 ended. They had arrived August 14 the day the pacific war ended. Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece that means he could of maybe joined military. Luke said it took about 2 weeks to travel across the Atlantic Ocean. It took a month to travel to china from united states. There lucky because they had 335 horses on the cargo ship with enough food and hay. Luke had to take care of all the horses it was his job. It was no big deal though when he was a little kid his aunt made him work on her farm to be prepared. Just in case he did work in a farm in future and look he is taking care of animals. On Luke's second trip he was a night watchman. All he had to do was check on the animals every single hour. Luke loved being a Seagoing cowboy it was more than he ever wanted. He had some scary moments but you have to face some fear. He was very scared when he almost fell off a cargo ship but a metal peice saved his life. Luke would find some time to have his own time and talked to the animals.

Others think it should be used for disapline. I agree that we should use it for kids that act up or have detention because they would have to clean for what they did and it wont waste's the teachers time. The reason they should do this is because they wasted their time fooling around in class so now they have to make up that time by doing the service. Another reason why they should do this is because the world is filthy enough that we cant have that no more so what they can do is clean the public park of all its trash.There is a lot of different needs to be done all around the schools and maybe they can do some of that. Their might also be stuff in school to do so they can do that to. If this works maybe the kids in the schools might not act up and pay attention in class. sincerely, my name...."

These cities experience less smog and pollution. People in the places that have limited car uses do not seem to mind. A quote from In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal explans how giving up their car has improved their live, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"". Cars do cause alot of tension and stress from being in trafic and having to deal it bad drivers on the road. Many people are already too stressed and anything that can limit stress is good for you. In Bogota, Colombia the city has ond day that is car-free. This day people hike, skate, or used public transportation to get where they needed to be. Violaters are fined $25. The over all goal of this day is to promote diffrent forms of transportation. Even though weather can be a factor it didnt seem to affect people. Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky states how this is true ""The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota."" This quote also shows that people are fine surviving with out cars. Paris baned driving for diffrent cars on diffrent days because of the near-record pollution. Moday cars with even-numbered license would be fined 22-euros if they drove and the next day the rule would apply to odd-numbered licences. There were exceptions for cars that are plug-in, car pools with three or more people, and hybids. Robert duffer, the author of Paris bans driving due to smog showes how well the ban worked in this quote 'The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to riscind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday"". This is a great example of how much polution would be cut out if we stopped or limmited useing cars. Just one day with out everyone using cars and there was a diffrence in the smog amount. Limiting car usage also will cut carbon emitions and help the enviroment. In The End of Car Culture the author, Elisabeth Rosenthal states ""...transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions..."" With a limit on cars, trucks, and other moter veicals greenhouse gas emissions will lower. America is already lowering it's car usage by it's self. People are buying fewer cars, getting fewer licenses, and driving less all together. Over all the affect with giving up moter veicals and finding other forms of transpertation are very positive. People would have less stress, reduce in greenhouse gasses, and lower pollution."
24870,0,"Is getting advice from people worth your time and energy? Why is getting advice helpful? Almost everyone, once in their life will need some advice. It can be advice for anything like school, relationships and sports etc. The advice can come from anyone like your dad, mom sister, brother and friends. In some cases getting advice can or may not be beneficial. Some people might give you good advice or bad advice depending the reason why you need advice. Getting help from multiple different people will help solve your problem faster. If you get advice from multiple different perspectives, it will give you a broader point of view on how to solve your problem. Seeking multiple opinions will help you make a better choice. In addition talking to other people for advice it will help you make better decisions in the future. For example If someone needed homework advice, they might go ask their teacher for help or their parents for help. By doing that they can get two different opinions on how to do their homework, so now it is easier to complete the homework. Another reason why asking multiple people for advice is good because, some people might have gone threw the thing you are needing to go threw. Therefore to ask multiple people you might find someone who is perfect to help you with your problem. The more you ask people they more experience you will get to make your final decision. So if you don't find the perfect person for the advice you can adjust some things and make it yours. People who ask advice are people who are most likely going to succeed with there problem. I believe this became when people ask for advice they really wan't to fix their problem. Therefore If they want to fix there problem they will ask more people for advice. When you talk to more people for advice you will gain more knowloge on your problem, so maybe you can come up with your own advice to fix your problem. Some people might ask advice for many different things but some people will ask for clarification. For example when someone has a question about the advice they have gotten they can ask for clarification. Clarification is a good way to separate good advice from bad advice. You might need ask multiple people for the clarification you need, which is better for you. To wrap everything up, asking multiple people for advice will help you solve your problem and will help you in the long run. So asking will help you succeed in the future with other problems you might have. In addition people who have the desire to fix their problem will promblem get it done. So maybe next time when you have a problem you just might be able to fix it yourself."
8292,0,"The author supports this idea well because they give alot infromation, and deatils about Venus, and how venus is the second planet from our sun. The author suggest to study Venus because is important to know about it and how it's bad or good. Humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. The mission was unmanned, and for a good reason because no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hour. This why venus could be dangerous because not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. I choose this evidence because expalins alot about venus, and how spacescraft don't want to go down their because no one survived the landing, and how Venus could be dangerous. First, it talks about how Venus,and Mars our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. Then it talks about 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus even more challenging are the clous of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere and the planet surface, temparatures avarage over 800 degrees Fahrenheit."

I thought that community service is supposed to be about caring for others. It shouldn't be about forcing kids to do it but it should be about it coming from the heart. When something comes from the heart it tends to mean more to others than forcing them to do it. Ask anybody, there is more to wanting than forcing. Trust me I've learned the hard way. If you force them to do it they won't like it. But if you suggest it, they might like it! One time I was at a girl scout meeting and we were deciding what to do for St. Patrick's Day. Our troop leader FORCED us to do a charity party and to tell you the truth I hated it! But you know what, over time it got better! We ended up in doing 6 charity drives raising $7,872!!! Then This year I proposed a St. Patrick's Day party at a local nursing home. Oddly EVERYONE liked the idea. So lately, all we have been doing is getting ready for it. I mean how often do the elderly get visitors!?!?!? I hope this party turns out to be fantastic!!! and with everyone in such a happy mood what can go wrong? You see TEACHER_NAME, by force people hate. But by choosing, people tend to like! That is all for now, STUDENT_NAME 8th Grader p. s. if you would like to come and help give me a call TODAY!!!;)"
14683,0,"Community service is helpful and shows caring. Some people think community service is a waste of time, but it helps others and in ways helps you to. Community service shows caring, helps you in a college application, and sometimes make others happy. Community service shows caring by helping the environment. Some community service requires picking up trash on high ways, or really any where. Helping the environment is very important, our factories are already polluting the air. So by sighing up for community service and picking up trash, it can make a difference, and is one less thing that is polluting our air. Community service, doesn't only help the environment but also helps you in a better education. Many colleges look to see if you have done any community service, so by having that on your application you are more likely to be picked. By starting young, on doing community service, you have more years to do more and more community service. It would be a shame if you weren't able to get into a college just because u didn't do any community service. By pursing to do community service, it doesn't just help you but also helps others. Many elderly people in homes are alone, and need someone to be there with them. By sighing up to help in a elderly home you make others feel happy and not alone. Elders sometimes have families that live far away and miss there children, but by going over there and keeping them company it makes you happy as well as the elders. Community service helps our society and environment. Just by sighing up it shows carrying, helps you in college applications, and makes others happy. I strongly agree that community service should be required, in all generations."
24227,0,"Online courses and receiving your education at home can be beneficial in many ways due to the fact that you're technically not in ""school"" for seven hours a day learning. For this very reason, being home schooled and having online courses gives you the chance to have more time to do your work, reevaluate, and overall to take as long as you may need, and whats important is feeling comfortable and moving at your own pace. Although, some may take this as an advantage or opportunity to try and fit in extracurricular activities and or to try and learn new things because maybe they want to pursue something different that needs more time of something and less time of a seven hour education course that restricts them of doing so because school takes up almost of half of the time in their every day life. Online classes can often help people but make it harder for other people to learn, sometimes you'll need a buddy to help out or you'll need a teacher to ask questions to learn but people may take online courses because they feel that they can work better alone rather than to be working with others and thats where they could be in the wrong. You're not always going to know everything, you have to give yourself the chance to open up and have the opportunity so that you could expand your knowledge of education, there's a point in time where you've got to say ask a classmate or teacher for help, and Im not speaking on the behalf of everyone but thats how people are, they think they can learn everything there is to know about something but you've got to take a step back and know when to say hey and say these five simple words and that is, ""may I get help please"". Therefore I do Indeed agree that taking online classes is a great way to benefit off of beacause people may feel that they can work on their own and move at their own pace and overall just have an amazing experience at the end of the day."
775,0,"Phones and Driving Danger has fascinated humans for centuries. So has technological advancements or just technology in general. Cell phones are a wonderful thing just like driving is a wonderful thing but like an open flame and gasoline, who said they should go together? Texting while driving has led to way too many deaths. While common sense should tell you not to deviate attention form the road where you're not just driving for yourself but for everyone else, people still do it even though they shouldn't. People shouldn't text and drive because deviating your attention from something serious can only end up bad. If you were hiding from Jason Voorhees, scared for your life, would you watch a YouTube video? Of course not, because you are focused on staying safe. Driving should be treated the same way because one bad decision could result in a multicar collision and someone dead. In the state of Georgia, there is a law against a driver being on their phone because of the reasons stated in the previous paragraph. There is also a fine of $150.00 as a punishment. That's better that being a number in the 1.6 million people who die every year due to texting a driving. Or the better case would be just not being on your phone and texting in the first place. Wouldn't you agree? The final way to stop these fatalities is to put your cell phone in driving mode. Newer model cars with the Bluetooth feature allow this feature to be enabled. That feature blocks all notifications until you are out of the vehicle. That makes it safe for the driver by taking their mind of their phone and helps others by keeping the drivers mind focused on the road. That's a true definition of safety first. Driving is a privilege has always been true but it matters more and more every year as more people get distracted by the newest feature on their phone. Whatever is on Instagram can't be more important than your life. As more people replace their cars for the newest car that Bluetooth feature will be widely available to more people. As technology advances, people's urgency of safety while driving should too. What's more important, what Kim Kardashian just did on Snapchat, or your life and everyone else's?"
15438,0,"Dear Principal, I am writing this letter to you to discuss to you about your new plan about not allowing students to participate in any sports unless they have a B average. Honestly I have to say that I like but at the same time dislike the idea. I like the idea because if a student in the school knows they are failing school and they play basketball but they cant play because they are failing they would try to bump up they're grades so that they can play basketball and also that would be good for the school if everyone had a B average. I dislike the idea because some students aren't as smart as others and getting a B would be very hard for them to achieve. What I am trying to tell you is to reconsider the idea before putting it into effect. Take some time to think about what ideas. You have to look at this from both ways/sides. In conclusion all I have to say is that I am glad that you are our new principal. You are doing an excellent job and keep up the good work. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME"

We are equal in rights. If the students will only be aloud to use them during free periods then so should the teachers. We wouldn't have to break the rules if there was no rules to break. So if they were aloud then nobody would try to sneak it all the time during classes. If you made it so that cell phone were banned from the school then a lot of people would need to use the school phones so that they could get rides home and things like that. phones are useful to the student body and if they were taken away then it would be very inconvenient. And since we are all equal then you would have to leave yours at home too and all the teachers would not be aloud either. So the better option is definitely to let the students use them during there free classes. We would be really grateful of you if you could be so nice as to let us keep them. plus if they were banned how would you check every student to make sure that they didn't have a phone with them? sincerely, the student body"
20993,0,"Dear Principal, I am aware that you are reconsidering the school's cell phone policy. The policy that I believe to be better is the second policy you have chosen. The first policy would allow students to have their phones during free-time and time in the cafeteria, but students would have the phones in their pockets, tempting them to use the phone during class. The second policy you chose would improve our school because students wouldn't have their phones at all, so it wouldn't tempt them to use it during class. Plus, it reduces the risk of students using their phones to cheat. Before class, students could be checked for a phone, to make sure they don't have their phones with them. Students shouldn't have their phones in school at all because they don't need them. Their friends are at school with them, they can talk at lunch time, and their friends outside of school can wait to talk until they're out of school. Letting students have phones in school would give them a greater chance of cheating because they would be tempted to use the phone they have in their pocket. I hope you consider my opinion on the cell phone policy change. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME"
13012,0,"In 1976 a NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was going around Mars looking and taking pictures of places where Viking 2 could land. It spotted a shadow that looked like a human face. It was a huge head about 2 miles from one end to the other end. The face looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Some scientists figured out it was just a mesa but people started thinking it could be proof that aliens were real. They then started making movies of the face and magazines and stuff like that because they believed aliens had created the face. NASA already knew it was just a common mesa. NASA and the scientists already knew it was a mesa but it looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh. As soon as they showed the public the picture people started believing that it could be evidence that aliens created that and are living. Hollywood started making movies, books, and a lot of other stuff. Scientists wanted to be sure that it was just a mesa, so NASA then sent another spacecraft. They took another picture and saw that it looked nothing like the first picture. They had to send another spacecraft in 2001 just to make sure it wasn't a mistake and to see which one was correct. The picture looked different too but looked so much better so NASA and scientists told the public it was a mesa. The face in Mars was just a natural landform. The same thing basically happens around Western America. A guy, Garvin, said that the face reminds him of Middle Butte in Idaho. He said, ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height at the face on Mars."" The first picture they took in 1976 of the face really looks like not a natural landform. As the cameras got more better, in 1998, the face kind of still had the face shape but it looked more flat. The picture in 2001 just made the face look just like a natural landform. The 2001 picture, which is the latest one, shows no proof of living things in mars. The face looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh in the first picture they took. The latest picture, in 2001, the face looked like a butte or mesa. The face was just a natural landform like the landforms that happen in Western America. If it was proof that there is living things in Mars, it would be beneficial for both tax payers and NASA. Hopefully they'll go again soon and take pictures to confirm if it was a natural landform or it's really proof that there is living things in mars, but I don't think they're going to go again because a lot of people now believe it was just a natural landform. At last, the face was just a natural landform and was not made by aliens. The face did really look like it was created because that's what the people in ancient times bascically did but it was just a landform. The picture first picture was really cool not going to lie and I thought it was created by a living thing but when I saw the recent pictures it just started to look like a natural landform. Maybe they'll find more evidence and confirm if it was just a natural landform or if it was created by aliens, who knows."

Google and other major corporations have been working around the clock for years trying to make that dream become a reality and are getting closer than anyone could've imagined, but do you really trust a computer with the lives of your friends and family. Yes technology has come a long way the past few years and for the most part it has made positive impacts on our day-to-day lives but we cant just forget the downsides of all these new tech gadgets. Think about how easy it is for someone to hack into your laptop or phone and get all of your person information. How long do you think it would take skilled hackers to find a way to get control of your self driving car once they are released, 6 months maybe a year and you could have thousands of peole trying to gain full power over your vehicle and they just might be able to. Lets also not forget that computers and other devices malfunction quite often, more frequently then we'd like to admit. Have you ever been on your laptop while constructing an important document and your system just completely shut down without saving? That has happened to me and many people I know and we all thought it was one of the worst things that could happen. Can you imagine what would happen if you're on the middle of the expressway taking a nice road trip with your family and your car just shuts off in the middle of the highway surrounded by 10 ton trucks that could crush your small self driven car like it was an empty soda can. I can risk losing papers on my hard drive due to a malfunction, but im not willing to risk my life to one. Sure everyone has dreamed of a self driving machine but now that you know all the things that could inevedably go wrong, does it really seem like that cool of an idea? Lets say you can afford a car that drives it self, can you afford the damage you could be held responsible for if something goes wrong with the vehicle. Can you afford to maintain and repair a 2 ton computer that has enough technology to drive you around? I hope that the facts i have told you today will help clear up and questions you've had about if its worth it or not because when you really think about it, it's truely not."
3601,0,"Every year from 6th grade to 12th grade year students have to do a summer project and turn it in to their teachers in their next upcoming school year. Due to al the mixed feelings about the project there's been a debate about whether it should be student-designed or teacher-designed. Summer projects should be designed by teachers because the teachers will ensure the student will learn and grow and they'll set the proper criterias for it. Teachers know what students need to learn and usually what they will be learning in their next school year. With this knowledge teachers can determine how the projects should be structured to help benifit the students and make them grow. For example a summer reading project, a project made by a teacher where the students have to choose a book that's on the reading level that they should be at and do a report on it. The way this project is structured helps students learn and grow by keeping them reading making them grow stronger in it which can help them in the future with work,writing,etc. If somebody wants to learn something they need certain criterias to help them actually learn. A person can't learn something from something they already learned and know. The same thing can be applied to summer projects a student can't learn something new from something easy and that they already know. They need certain criterias, restrictions, rules on stuff to ensure they will learn. Teachers can ensure that the students will grow and continue on learning by putting the correct criterias. For example the summer reading project again where students have to choose a book in their reading level and do a report. If the teacher didn't put the rule of choosing a book in their reading level a student could have chose a very easy book and not really learn anything from it because it's not challenging for the student and something too easy to learn from. Therefor having teachers designing the projects ensures they will put the right rules down to make sure the students is learning. Not all students will do something like that but having a teacher makes it easier and more trusting to know they will keep learning over the summer. Some people think students should design it because it would be a lot more funner for them, get them more engaged, and make them a lot more enthusiastic about it when given the chance to design it. It's good to have the students enthusiastic and engaged but it's not ensured whether they will learn something or not. The chance of a student designing a project that won't help them learn much is not beneficial and defeats the purpose of the summer projects. It's a teachers's job to make sure that students are learning so they will do their job and make sure they are. It's better to know for sure the students will learn with the teachers designing it rather than to not be sure with the students designing it. Teachers are way more educated that students are. So they can make the best projects that can benefit the students the most compared to the students designing it. They know what to do, what to look for, and what's best for school. They are more trained,equiped, and have more knowledge to do it. So teachers should be designing summer projects not students."
1355,0,"There is many different advantages to limiting car use. The most important advantage to with this experiment is less gas emissions exit the exhaust pipes and cause greenhouse gases. This is a major advantage because our economy is filled with so much pollution and can and has caused serious damage to our health. The Environmental Protection Agency is promoting many car reduced communities. Paris, France enforced a driving pan to clear its air of smog and toxic gases. Any motorist who got caught driving was forced to pay a fine of $31. If refusal to pay the fine came to, The drivers car was impounded. The main cause of this smog in Paris was caused by diesel fuel. Diesel vehicles make up 67 percent of vehicles in Europe. Another main benefit from car and driving reduction is exercise. Instead of driving people can ride a bike, walk, jog or even run to get to their destination. In Bogota, Columbia there is a program that is possible to spread to other countries. Millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car free day. In America studies show people are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses each year. This can help stop the obesity rating not only in the U.S. but also in many other countries. Finally, Another advantage is people can save a whole lot more of money each week, month, and year. People of every country spends hundreds of thousands of dollars if not millions on their car. Whether it is for gas or buying a completly new car, People are consistently spending hard earned money on something that can be avoided with a nice relaxing walk. With citizens not spending money on these so called ""necessities"", they will be able to buy more important things. For example, Many people will be able to purchase a newer home instead of living in a weekly rent pay of an apartment. This can give many people the feeling of accomplishment and the feeling of control over their life. They will also be able to purchase food and drink so they don't starve or dehydrate. Many people go hungry everyday and suffer from dehydration. With vehucles gone people can save the necessary money needed for more life saving things."
6618,0,"In schools today, the average amount of students participating in extracurricular activities is only about half of the school's population. This number continues to go down as more students lose interest in participation because of the technological advances. Additionally, they do not make an attempt to participate in the provided activities with the assumption that there is no need for them to go. Although students may believe that it is pointless, there are many benefits to participating in them. By requiring all students to take at least one activity, it gives them the push they need to start their exploration with the variety of options given. This requirement for students is necessary for schools because it would increase their school spirit, give them place to socialize, and help them with time management. If all students were to participate in an extracurricular activity for school, the increase of involvement would bring more school spirit. For example, students look forward to big football games because it generates energy and excitement from everyone. They come to watch the games in big crowds, always representing their school with coordinating colors and often wearing face paint. It creates a lot of school spirit not only from the stands, but also the players that are participating in the games. Players absorb the support given off by the spirit of the crowd and use it to boost up their own energy, which increases their playing performance. Another example of an activity that increases school spirit is academic teams. For example, Science Olympiad is an after school club that often competes with other teams across the county. The members always have a lot of spirit, representing their school through their outfits. When they win these competitions, students and staff members are energetic about the accomplishment that the team has made for the school. These sports and academic teams are both examples of extracurricular activities that generate more energy for schools and are just a proportion of activities that students can participate in. Along with the school spirit that these activities bring, they would also create a place for students to talk to each other. The large variety of different students doing extracurricular activities would give them opportunities to socialize and meet new people. During school there is not much time for students to talk because of classes and lessons that are being taught. With extracurricular activities, they are able to join together with friends and socialize with each other for a longer amount of time. Students can join clubs such as the newspaper and yearbook committee, or sports teams like football and basketball. For example, last year I joined the yearbook club because one of my friends went with me. We were able to talk to each other for longer than we used to, and even grew closer because of it. Additionally, extracurricular activities allow students to meet new people. For example, I joined an after school club as a consultant to guide students with their writing. Through that club I have met a range of different people that I have connected with, whether it be the other consultants or the students I have helped. It has allowed me to make new friends with people I had never met before. All extracurricular activities not only give students chances to socialize with old or new friends, but also allows students to manage their time. Requiring students to partake in extracurricular activities helps them practice their time management of school work and extra activities. Along with the activities that students would have to do, they would continue to get loads of school work. This is good for students because it makes them think about how they manage their time. For example, I play on a volleyball team as one of my extracurricular activities. With the two hour practices during the weekdays and eight hour tournaments on the weekends, it was hard to manage everything at first. I started to organize my schedules and prioritize the most important things first, such as assessments for school. The experiences that I have had with handling volleyball and school has helped me learn to manage the once overwhelming workload. This time management that students like me will learn is important because it prepares them for life after graduating high school. For example, colleges have higher amounts of school work from the classes for credits and majors for different occupations. To be able to handle the workload and out of school activities, students need to be able to manage their time efficiently. Additionally, many jobs such as doctors and lawyers also have big amounts of work to do. Through being organized with their schedules and managing their time, they can work efficiently without stress. College students and workers that already know how to manage their time because of high school will do a better job than those who did not. That is why by making students take extracurricular activities now, it prepares their time management for college and future occupations. The school should require all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it creates energy from them, allows them to talk with old or new friends, and prepares their time management skills. Activities such as team sports generate school spirit from the supporters and players because of the large amount of energy that is given off. In addition, all extracurricular activities create a space for students to socialize with people and even make new friends. With these activities there is also the school workload, which teaches students to manage their more time efficiently. These prove that by requiring students to participate in an activity it benefits the students more so than the school. Therefore, our school, and even all schools across the country, should make this a requirement for their students."
12352,0,"""Unmasking the face on Mars"" ""Big News"" NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft has found something while circling Mars. But what is it, they have seem to have found a face formed into the rocks. Is this new discovery actually a face or is it just another rock formation. The believers and the non-believers of the face on Mars are waiting anxiously to find out what it is. Is it a rock formation or is it an actual human face, no one knows. The (MOC) has finally released the newest picture which is 10 times sharper than any picture the Viking spacecraft could have taken, and the JPL web seach has revealed tht the face on Mars is actually just another rock formation. Even though NASA has put the picture out there that proves that the face on Mars is not acually a face but just another land formation, there are still some skeptics out there that think taht the theory is true. Skeptics have said that perhaps since on the day the picture was taken was a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet that the alien marking were hidden by the haze. NASA had come to Mars to take a picture of the face at the wrong time and if they were to come another day they might have been able to see that it was an actual face and not just some rock formation. Around the American West there are common landforms know as butte or mesa and they are actually equivalent to the Martian. Could the butte or mesa landforms be know on other planets besides ours? We are able to get the right size because "" as a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size"" so be comparing the actual size of the butte or mesa to right about the size of the Martian when we do the math. The land formation on earth reminds people most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho "" thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars"". In conclusion the Face on Mars is just another regular plain old natural landform. "" So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even a shack."""
25970,0,"When needing advice due to a problem in life, people often go to someone to ask for advice and they generally go to multiple people to ask advice. For many people this can seem peculiar, going to multiple people for advice might seem point less to some, but when thought about, this method is a helpful way to make a better choice. By using the method of asking multiple people for advice, this could help someone make a better choice by doing this the person could see the problem from different perspectives, the person could get information that the other person asked didnt know, and there is the off chance that the person could be getting biased advice from the person without knowing. In all asking for advice from multiple people is helpful and is recommended to many people when dealing with a problem where they can use some advice with a problem they are struggling with. If a person has a problem, a challenge most have is seeing it from other's perspective, sometimes a problem can only be solved when you take a step back and try to look at in a new way, and talking to multiple people concerning the topic can help someone do this. For example, say someone got into an argument with a friend after being offended by something the friend said, after they talked to multiple people about this they then could see that the friend didnt mean to offend him/her. If the person had not gone to someone else for advice then they wouldn't have realized that the friend was sorry and didnt mean to offended him/her, by talking to multiple people it helped them make a better choice. Besides helping people look at their problem from a different perspective, talking to multiple people can still help people make better choices in other ways, they could get information from someone that the previous people that they talked to didnt know, and the information could help influence their decision. When people have a problem they seek advice from those around them, a major reason to asking multiple people for advice is that one of the people that is asked could be someone who has information that the others didnt know, or withheld. For example, in a 6rd grade class there was a boy who had trouble in history class, there was a history test on the following Friday, the boy was worried so he asked his best friend, Generic_Name what he should do, Generic_Name told him not to stress and that to study and he'll be fine. He trusted his friend's advice but asked his other friend, Generic_Name, just to be sure, his other friend told him that the test was 20 questions mostly surrounding the declaration of independence, after getting this information he studied his notes surrounding the declaration of independence and ended up getting a 98% on his history test, due to knowing what to expect. The boy at first only asked his best friend but after getting advice from another person, he understood what the test was about and what he should do. This method of asking multiple people for advice helped him and if he had not asked his other friend for advice, he would have been unprepared for the test. Besides the reasons to ask multiple people for advice, getting a different perspective and getting additional information,there is still another major reason to ask multiple people for advice, which is on the off chance that the first person(s) they asked were biased, and didnt give them direct information based on facts and not opinions. Everyone is life will eventually have a problem that they struggle with, and the best course of action is to ask for advice from others around them, but to make sure that they are making a good choice they should get advice from multiple people, not just because of the needed perspective or the need for additional information, but because there is always a chance that the first person asked is giving biased advice. For example, at lunch there was an argument between 4 friends about DC vs Marvel movies and a mutual friend of the 4 was forced to chose a side in the argument, the mutual friend had never seen a DC or Marvel movie and didnt know anything about them, she went to ask advice about which side to choose from one of her friends that was on side DC, they told her that DC was better in special effects, plot and actors. She trusted her friend's advice but to make sure she had all the information she asked her older brother, someone who had seen all DC and Marvel movies and wasnt someone who had picked a side and genuinely supported both sided, her brother told her that DC and Marvel were both amazing franchises, but generally Marvel had a bigger budget and that they had more plot detail. After talking to her brother and her friend, she came to the conclusion that she believed Marvel was better franchise wise. The girl at first did not know what to do and after consulting her DC friend she was convinced DC was better, but after talking to her brother, who didnt chose a side, realized that she, personally, supported Marvel. If she did not go to another source for advice then she wouldn't have known that her DC friend was biased and embellished on a lot of details. With all of this it clear that asking for advice from multiple people helped her chose a better choice. In conclusion, whether someone has a small problem like which franchise they support or if its a more intricate problem like a miss communication that could destroy a life long friendship, no matter how big or small the problem is asking advice is always something that helps and asking multiple people for advice could help make a better choice when dealing with a problem. Asking multiple people helps when someone needs a new perspective, additional information of the topic or if they just arent sure if the person they are getting advice from is biased. In all asking for advice from multiple people is helpful solution and is highly recommended to many people when dealing with a problem where they can use some advice with a problem they are struggling with."
15156,0,"Dear Principal, My name is STUDENT_NAME and i do not agree with you about having at least a B average to play a sport. I believe that students should at least have a C average because the sports they have keep them healthy and fit. If you made it the way you want it, the students could end up obese or their grades might drop. If they are to have at least a C average, they are still getting good grades and doing their homework. Students rely on their sports to stay healthy and even though their grade are not a B average, but they are still trying and getting the work done. I am going to be in three different types of sports in one year, cheering, color guard and volley ball. So as you see i also rely on sports but not only because they keep me fit and healthy but because i enjoy doing them. Students all around the world are in different sports and even thought they might not have the best grades, you know that they are having fun and they enjoy doing what they do; But if you take their sports away, what are they suppose to do on their free time? There might even be a lot more fighting and arguments because of all the free time on their hands. If they already do their studying in a regular basis, are they suppose to just sit on the couch, eat food and watch television? Here that's what we call being lazy. Students should have fun and its good for them to socialize. If they are in sports, that could be a possible scholarship, even if they have a C average. You can see there progress in their school work if you let do their sports. A healthy body equals a healthy mind. You shouldn't pressure students into doing their work and getting good grade because those students' grades can begin to decline and they might even transfer school to do what they love, I would. Students need that endurance and a lot of strength to go through the rest of their life. So please listen to me, keep it at a C average and let students work up to a B average. They would really appreciate that. Like I said, students need and love their sports. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME"
14823,0,"Dear Principle, Some kids don't do anything around the house. There are also kids who don't help out the community; they would rather stay at home and just hang out with friends. That is why I believe that you should require all of the students at our school to do community service. There are so many kids that just sit inside all day and play video games and watch television. They can be a big help to the community if they help out in any way. After you perform community service, you always feel like you have done something good for the community. That feeling is incredible, and makes you want to keep doing good things. There are many ways that kids can do community service. Kids of our age don't do community service on their own because they think it's boring and a waste of time. Those kids think that community service is just picking up trash on the highway, or having to donate money to a charity. There are many ways that kids can do community service, ranging from going to work with a parent or helping out at the school. I even know some friends that go to work at the soup kitchen so homeless people can have food. They say that it's very fun because they are all together. They also like to see the look on homeless peoples faces. They are always grateful and happy when they get their food. Certain kids do not want to do community service because it conflicts with their schedules. It also a waste of time to them. People don't know that community service can be done, but enjoyed at the same time. I was in a Leadership class where I had to do ten hours of community service. At first I was frustrated and kind of dubious of what I should do. I later found out that I can work at places that I love to be. I went to help out my cousin over the weekend at the basketball court because he asked me to help his team. I went and I enjoyed it because I love basketball and have a great knowledge of it. Because kids think it is boring and a waste of time, they don't do community service. The kids that never do community service will regret it for the rest of their lives. My dad's work is the top donating business in San Bruno. They are also donate the most time doing community service. Because of that, they have built trust with many people around the United States, and his business is very successful. Community service comes from the heart. It takes a real human being to skip an hour of time being with his friends to do some community service."
10504,0,"It is 2018, everything is changing from our clothes, media, social norms, etc. Scientists are moving closer to become independent of labor and moving more towards technology. First it was the car, then phones, now facial action coding system. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" written by Nick D'Alto, the idea of having technology to do decode what emotion you are feeling is central to popular belief. The idea that a camera with a few buttons would be able to tell how you are feeling is absolutely impeccable. The everyday use of technology should not become normal. This society needs to know that soon enough everything will be controlled by technology. The article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" has many ideas that I do not agree with. Starting with the fact that putting a facial action coding system in a classroom will be the same as if an effective teacher were to be there. The demonstration of this system itself seems very interesting, but only in the right place and the right time. In paragraph six Doctor Huang explains ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"" this mean that the computer will be there physically but will rarely give any verbal or emotional communication. Putting this in a classroom full of students and having it code their emotions is not only a crime to teachers everywhere but also to the students. Not only do the students need someone physically to be there, they also need someone to model for them. All students have different ways of learning. If the students who learn by the teacher modeling, they won't be doing very good with the computer. Not only do the students need a teacher there as a figure to respect and trust, but they also need their own privacy. Doctor Huang states ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" this is not necessarily a good thing. If the computer is watching their every move and facial or emitonal expression they would feel like they are constantly being watched. This is a feeling the children should not be exposed to at an age where you are just being a kid. If the students are being watched, they are then mainly apart of a science experiment that they did not agree to and that is not right. The final reason why this computer would not be effective with the kids is that there is a liability factor when it comes to putting one of these in your classroom. You have to think about what the parents' will have to say. Doctor Huang also includes ""If you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" this means that the computer is watching every single move you do while you are searching the web. The camera is turned on and who knows if a person might be watching you through the other end. Many parents or even potential buyers may not want this from new technology. In conclusion, technology will be apart of our everyday lives whether we like it or not. The different types of technology that we use is what we can control. The Facial Action Coding System is the type of technology that students and teachers should steer clear of. Technology may be able to do cool things, but that doesn't mean it doesn't come at a price."

I think and i think i speak for the whole school we at least should have a D average because if you really want to play in a sport or do an activity you should keep your grades up above an F that way you passing you class or classes but you also know that its not all fun and games you have to do your studies first in order to be in any type of activity and if you do good in school you can accomplish anything in life. I know parents say that its good to be in any type of sport but you have to like its because it keeps you out of trouble well its true i mean if you change this policy you might see this straight student go from a good student to always calling his/her patrol officer to see if he/her doesn't have any type of weapon's please TEACHER_NAME think about how this is going to affect the students and our community."
18091,0,"Technology is a big part of today's society. I feel that technology is over used. People today are finding ways to have technology do simple tasks for us. For example, instead of using a book, a student looks at a screen all day. Now the idea of autnomous cars has been around for a few years. I am not for autonmous cars because texting while driving will increase, jobs at gas stations will decrease, and it will cause people of the future to become less active than they already are. In today's society, texting and driving is another issue we have. If a person is in an autonomous car and are only needed when the car cannot navigate through certain driving conditions, the driver could text much more leading to wrecks caused by drivers texting. Therefore, the autonomous care being unsafe for the roads. If autonomous cars begin to get popular, jobs at gas stations will begin to decrease. In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"", it states ""The cars he, Sergey Brin, foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis..."" This statement indicates that there will be less gas needed to put into this autonomous car which will lead to gas stations around cities will lessen. Some may say that is a plus because they don't have do pay twenty dollars to put in gas every week; however, I believe that if these autonomous cars come about, the need for gas will be less and jobs will be lost. Without people needing a whole lot of gas, what's the point in multiple gas stations around town? People in today's society are already inactive as it is with all the technology that is available. For example, there is shopping online so they don't have to leave home and cellular phones and computers to connect with people without leaving home. The companies trying to manufature the autonomous car will be another advanced technology that will make today's people even more inactive. It seems today with all of these technology, the world will soon be over ran by all of these techonologies. Therefore, the manufacturers should not continue making devices such as the autonomous car. In conclusion, I am not for autonomous cars because texting while driving will increase, jobs at gas stations will decrease, and people in the future will become less active than they already are."
14369,0,"Dear Principal, I think that all students should be required to do some community service. We all have to live in this town together so why don't we all take part in keeping it clean and a nice place to live. Community service is not just to keep things clean, but it is also to help people live a better and healthier life. Some people don't think community service is worth the time, but those people have never taken the time to try it. They don't know the satisfaction you get when you see the smile on a person's face for doing the right thing. People always thank you and most of all you know inside that you did the right thing and that fills an emptiness inside. Sometimes community service can be fun. If you happen to do something that you are interested in. Like maybe if you're into sports you could clean up your local sports complex. And create a better more fun facility for everyone. Everyone that i know that has done any community service say they like it. They don't mind taking the time to do something good for someone else. Doing community service is also for your benefit, by keeping you up and active. It gives you something to do, rather than sitting at home on the coach being lazy eating potato chips and playing video games. So I think that it would be a good idea for you to have everyone do some kind of service to help the community. So please take this letter into consideration. Thank you for your time and i hope this letter helps your decision. Sincerely, Your Student"
8284,0,"Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger to pinpoint the difference between this and Earth, making heat and physical-resistant machines, and to find possible environment activity. Earth and Venus may be twins, but that doesn't mean it share the same geographics. In paragraph 3, it says "" The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" Therefore, Venus is way hotter than Earth. While talking about Venus' geographic background, it also says ""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. This shows Venus carries more extreme pressure; Consequently, lots of powerful weather. In this time, most companies make technology that can hold a certain measure of heat and physical conditions. This may also be a challenge to see how much the projects were built to reach its peak or observe downfalls to if it plays a significant role in human activites.. Back in the day technology was powerful to run very quickly, but doesn't have the ability to hold much temperature. In paragraph 2 its says, ""Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" Also paragraph 7, ""Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditons."" This could a starting point of why the making of better phones, computers, and powerful machines exist as generations go by. To find human activites around Venus is not easy. Due to strong heat it covers, a human or certain machines can't survive not even under a minute. For example, paragraph 3 says "" On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit"" and ""Such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" Venus is almost impossible to squeeze through; Consequently, there could be no chance. Venus is a powerful planet that it can require new inventions to be made while it need better and viewing research."

Luke also wanted to go seasgoing to show his friend how manly he is. Because his friend thought that hhe was scared to do something that is not normal in his life. So Luke wen't over sea to show his friend he is not afraid. But when Luke is over seas something bad happens. Luke is feeding the animals, and he trips over something and just about fell over board to his death. Luckly a peace of medal was sticking out the side of the ship and caught Luke before he almost died. Aways be carful when you on a ship traviling. Something bad aways happens. But anways Luke had a friend come along so they could hang out like most friends do. Luke and his friend was on the ship, and they stopped at a place where the horses and the animals had to get off. Then the boys had to find something to do so where the horses and the animals stayed is where the two kids started to play games like Baseball, Volleyball, Table-Tennis, Fencing, Boxing, Reading, and Whittling. So when the two boys were done doing their stuff like playing games they wen't back to their homes, to see their families. But when their time was up off seeing their families they both wen't back to the ship, and said bye to their families for a long time then it was time to go. The two boys did the same things they had done the last time they were on the sea. Then finally the day the two adults have been waiting for has now arrived to them. Now it is time to go back to their homes for good, and stay with their siblings and parents, and friends. One thing that all the people noticed when the two got back fromw sea. Is that the two boys they use to be are now gentlemen, not lids anymore. Then the never let those two lovible boys go on sea again. They couldn'y loose the boys again. Not now, not ever, never again. But of course they left again they could not stay with their families for ever. They just had to go back on seas again they had to. It was like their life when they wen't on the ship. The audults were now old enough to go to the military. Lukes friend wen't on. Lukes friend entered the military as soon as possible. He really wanted to support his countries. When the two kids got back to each other and started hanging out again. THey both wen't back to the sea job again cause they really liked it. They wen't there together nine times so they could see each other alot, and they hung out alot of course. When they got bak the two boys wen't straight to dee their mothers to see them right away. But when they got there they did not see there mamas at the house. Then the siblings and the other family memebers came out and told the two boys that their momas were gone. The two boys thought gone that the momas just wen't out get food, or to go out and eat together. But then the siblings told the two men that their moms was dead."

Student should be required to join after school activites because it will help them become more succesful, it is an oppertunity for students for students to make new friends, and joining extracurricular activites will help students learn to manage there time. Participating in after school activites will help students become more succesful. Studys have found that students who participate in after school activites are 58 percent more likley to make A-B honor roll. If all students joined activites and clubs then the majority of students would preform better. A local University found that students who joined clubs were less stressed. Joining clubs and acivites would help reduce the students stress levels. There are some clubs that students can join where teachers can help students with any work they do not understand. Most teachers stay after school at least once a week. I think that if all students joined clubs then students would be more likely to get better grades, have reduced stress, and get extra help. Joining clubs and other activites is a great way for students make new friends and do activites with there friends. Being a member of a club would allow students to meet new people in our school. Joining a club would give students a chance for them to talk to kids that are not in there classes. Students can sign up for clubs and acivites with there friends. Many students don't have classes with there friends, extracurricular activites would allow them to spend time with eachother. In some after school activites students students can work together to complete work that they dont undestand. In after school clubs students could help eachother. Joining clubs would give students a chance to make new friends, spend time with there friends, and give students a chance to work together. Some students may be busy doing other things out of school. Some students may visit familly or take care of a younger sibling after school. However I belive that students should be required to participate in an extracurricular activity. If all students joined extracurricular activites then it would help them learn to manage there time better and at a young age. Joining an extracuricular would help students manage there time bettwen school, extracurriculars, and there personal lives. If all students participate in extracurricular activites then students would be more sucessful, give them the oppertunity to be with there friends and make new friends, and help students manage there time. There are also many clubs and activites students can participate in. I strongly belive that it is in all of the students best intrests, to require students to participate in extracurricular activites."
998,0,"Cellphones & Driving You're driving down the street and your phone is blowing up. It's your son Ron he's got that bad thing again with his stomach. You text Ron back and let him know you're driving...or have a whole conversation with him trying to be a good parent and direct him to the medicine bag, again. Next thing you know flashing lights are behind you looking to give you ticket that ranges from 250$ to 2,750$ and if he doesn't he can be fined 11,000 dollars. Is it right to have cellular devices out while driving? Was this situation an acceptance? In this essay I will inform you on whether I believe having your devices out is wrong or right and have supporting facts and details. What are possible reasons when driving with a cellphone? There are at least 3 if you're a service driver and you need (directions). Two is in case of last minute call (urgent phone-call). Three, if your receiving an important phone call. These still aren't acceptable to the law tho. In the state of Georgia having a phone in your hands leads you straight to a ticket. I say these three things because I agree but because it's known that everybody does this out of Bad habit, it's going to happen. An average of 62.9 percent of the world owned a cellphone in the year 2016. Cellphones and he internet is a fast growing thing these days, some people can't keep away from them, but that doesn't mean it's okay to use them while driving there's a time and a place for that. I don't agree with those that use their cellphones incorrectly while driving. Technology is growing and the world has to learn how to adapt to it in safer matters, not texting and driving or taking selfies behind the wheel. There really aren't any real good excuses for being on it all the time while driving, there's built in GPS, and Bluetooth so for those reasons I said are acceptable aren't. Maybe the if it's in your hand ticket things a little too far but safety first. Cellphones and driving is risky and has a bad effect to the world. 1 out of 4 car accidents are caused by texting and driving in the united states. An estimated amount of 1.6million car crashes happen a year from it. Almost 390,000 injuries a year happen leaving people paralyzed when people text and drive with a high death rate. The fines and jail time aren't nice especially in bad cases. Those aren't acceptable numbers or is it worth the risk, don't expect your insurance to save you either. Please don't text and drive, be safe, and beware because your putting yourself and those around you at risk. Work cited? Georgia Law | Georgia. gov?

Well I have something to say. Aliens do not exist. If they were real, they would have took over the world. They would have been making us do work every single day. f they came here they would probaly have killed us by now. Have they killed us, have they started making us do work? No, they haven't. Grayson? Yes, Sir? I heard you and Kevin talking about how aliens made that face on mars. Both of you are wrong. You were right about the no aliens part, but everything else was wrong. We just now figured out that it was just another Martian mesa. It is common enough in Cydonia. When we took the picture, I have got a lot of e-mails saying ""what is that thing?"" I even got a e-mail from Michael Bay saying that he is going to use that image for a movie. This stuff is crazy! Thats awesome sir! Wait, Grayson there is more.

21788,0,"I agree with policy 1, but not without certain rules. Cell phones are used in almost everyone's daily life. It makes people feel safer when they can pull a phone from their pocket and call for help. Unfortunately, in today's society they are used for more then needed. I think it would be all right to allow children to use cell phones during breaks and lunch, but in classrooms the rules would have higher punishment. For example, making the cost higher to get it back or longer detention. That would be more suitable. When people are stopped from doing something completely they will most likely do it more. In my personal experience, about six months ago I went to a school that had such tight policies about cell phones, if phones were even seen in your pocket they would be taken up. Therefore the children used them all the time, in class, lunch, anywhere and anyway they could. Now, when I go this school, children are allowed to carry cell phones around and I see them being used so much less, the teachers aren't always talking about how the phones are never allowed, they make it easier on everyone. Seen and not heard. Of course, in extreme cases, policy 2 would be better, it depends solely on what kind of environment your in. Although in my school I see no good reason why not to allow cell phone usage on breaks, I think it would create a less stressful place. Teachers could even send notifications to the students, if that could be allowed, about homework updates or due dates. Besides cell phone are probably one of the most used, most owned devices in America, why not use them to help us with school and not get us in trouble."

Having a self-driving car is a bad idea because it still needs to be operated by humans, the car can malfunction, and the manufacturers can be blamed for the car crashes and other accidents that can happen instead of the blame being put on the driver. A self-driving car still needs to be somewhat operated by humans. There are certain times when the cars won't be smart enough to drive themselves such as when they need to navigate around accidents or work zones. Having a self-driving car gives humans a reason to not pay attention to the road while in their vehicles, which may cause many accidents. A self-driving car can malfuction. A self-driving car is a very difficult car to create. Odds are there will be more cars manufactured that have technology problems than there will be cars that are manufactured perfectly. If a self-driving car did malfunction, it may be hard for the driver to take back control of the car and there could be many accidents. A self-driving car can have many problems to it. These types of cars give drivers a reason to be careless and not pay attention to the roads.

All in all, while having a self-driving car would be easier and quite the dream, itr is not a good idea to have one.

12277,0,"Is the Face on Mars real? In my opinion the Face on Mars is real. Here are my reasons why. The Face on Mars is real because it can be a natural landform on Mars just like we have natural landforms on Earth. Now may I ask a question? How can ailens make a face on Mars? In the picture provided, it seems the face pops out and there is no evidence that a creature could have made a face with no flaws. In the article, a webiste states "" thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform."" I understand that people may have a theory about the face, but hence the word theory. Theory is just a guess with evidence supporting the claim, but is there enough evidence to support the Face? People from NASA have studied the Face since it first appeared in 1976. Since then, people have found claims and have had facts about the face proving it is just a natural landscape. How did the face appear? There can be many reasons on how the face appeared on Mars. There could have been a storm on Mars that caused the ground to move upright and form the Face. The face could have been on Mars since Mars was created and NASA just never payed enough attention until 1976. I do not believe an ailen created the Face on mars. Is the face on Mars real? Keep that question in your head. I believe this essay has provided enough evidence proving the Fac on Mars is just a natural landform. That's just my opinion. What's your opinion?"
19853,0,"Although numerous amounts of people want to banish the Electoral College, there are more rights than wrongs about it. The Electoral College is in the Constitution for an enormous reason; it is a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and popular vote of qualified citizens. This process allows for the people of the nation to have a say and for the elected people of each state to speak even louder for their state. The Electoral College is despised, yet it is the smartest way on how to elect the President. The Electoral College requires for a president to have trans-regional appeal. For example, Romney was a solid favorite in the South, but he cannot win with only the votes from the South because no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. While Romney did not have to campaign much for the South, he had to campaign very heavily in the North to increase his chances of election in those states. This is an amazing result because the people want a president that is liked throughout the nation, so while he is president he can be a hugely successful one. Canidates mainly focus on swing states, and dont have a lot of time for states they know they are going to win or lose; however, voters in swing states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign knowing they are the ones to decide the election. These voters in swing states are averagely the most thoughtful voters, and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election. Furthermore, the Electoral College should be kept because it almost always goes in favor of the people. Even though in the 2000 election Al Gore got the popular vote but George W. Busch won the electoral votes, that has not happened since 1888! The party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed. Many people want to change the election for the President to popular vote, but it would be more likely to have a dispute over the popular vote than in the elctoral college. Also, there could be a tie in the nationwide electoral vote because the total number of votes is an even number, but it is tremendously unlikely given that there has never been a tie. Also, the Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate receives a majority of the voter's cast. The Electoral College can be argued to repel potential voters for a canidate who has no hope of carrying their state, for example, republicans in California; on the other hand, every voter's vote plays a big part to their state's electoral vote. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. The Electoral College has worked for more than a century and will keep on working if the people of the nation agree to work with it."

The use of this program can be almost limitless when used corectly. Now that this program is real how should it be used. Should it be used to help the police find potental victums or used to see how people are feeling at work or school. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto he talked about its potential use at schools and how it could benefit schools by determinig if a studient is not learning or not happy. The use of this program has pros and cons, but in todays world it might be best to use it. Anyone who keeps up with the news should be able to say that the world is getting more messed up every day. In the last few weeks there has been another school shooting. To think about what would make a kid go and shoot people at a school or anywhere is hard to imagine. This is where this program should be implented at schools. The program could be used to anylise the daily emmotion level of students. If a studient is always unhappy, scared, or anything that shows a bad emmotion for a period of time the school can then act an see what the studients problem is. Nick D'Alto said that it could be used to help students be more ingaged and enjoy school more. This should not be used, unless the kid is being home schooled or using some form of an online class. This is because there is no way for a teacher to consantly moniter their students wheil teaching and there is not a good way for them to adapt when nessasary in the time that they have. Also kids are already unhappy to be at school and not too mention how teired they are. For this program to be used at school it should only be used to monater their happyness levels to prevent studients from doing bad things like commiting suiside or doing a school shooting. Any other use would be hard to anylize and or use in the way that Nick D'Alto mentioned."
1149,0,"Phones & Driving Isn't driving a vehicle without cellular devices distracting and stressful enough?? I can go ahead and explain why driving with a cell phone is not the right thing to do. It is also not the safest idea. Most of the world's population are using these devices while driving but don't realize, that to operate a vehicle it always takes two hands, at all times. So many things could go wrong at any time while driving even without these dangerous devices. No matter how far or how short of a distance you are traveling it does not make a difference. The generation we are barely living through in todays society, these people don't think about anyone but their selves. During this process, you don't only place yourself in life or death situation, you are also harming others and even the people around others. Driving while operating an electronic device is more than illegal in my point of view. Once, a family member of mine suffered and literally died during a car crash and this entire situation never involved a cellular device. That shows there is no need to add another hazard behind the wheel. Especially around others. Personally, the first step I take after entering a vehicle, is slapping that seatbelt on and placing my phone in my pocket after choosing music. Always do your personal process before you take the vehicle out of park. Cellular devices never became an issue until all of these smart phones were produced. The whole reason the government are making all of these newer, electronic, and way smarter is to prevent humans from using their cell phones while driving. One more thing to think about, is the larger the population grows, the more of this problem will grow and go on and on and on for generations. In my opinion, I think all these people that are driving, and operating cell phones, are just not experienced enough to drive at all. If you have ever been in any kind of accident behind the wheel, you should know that the littlest mistake can make the biggest difference. The feeling after that, just the adrenaline shoots through the roof. Once these people have made those mistakes, they would learn the lesson that is waiting for them in the future. If your one of the people that drive while on your cell phone, then you need to rethink if you really want to risk your life. It will happen, sooner or later, driving while using a cell phone is not okay, so it will happen. Even to the best of us. Do not drive while operating a cellular device. It is against the law, and it may cause serious injury and possibly death.!"
8976,0,"The author supports this idea that studying venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers because venus is the second planet from our sun. While venus is simple to see from the distant away but still safe. Earth, Venus, and mars are the planetary neighbor, that will go aroud the other planets. Venus is very close to the sun. Venus is just like a evening star that they call it in different places. Each previous mission was unmanned, and for more than a few hours. They always tried to watch venus the planet to see if there was anything new or they need to know something about it. Venus is kinda hot just like the sun becuase they are both close together. Even the clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere. The conditions can get far more extreme then humans which can get very bad. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study venus. Venus will be able to allow scienctists to see more thing and allow them to float above the fray. Peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can only provide a little amount of stuff that will go on. Venus is can be very dangous because it is so hot and u will not be able to vist it because it is so hot u will die from it. The sun and venus are the hottest out there. The comparison system that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces. Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size. Occasionally the closest in distance too. Numerous factors contributw to venus's repuatation as a challenging planet for humans to study, desprite its proximity to us. The thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Venus has a lot to get things from just like if you look up venus you probably can get alot from it. For scientists to get alot of things from venus they problaby have to get like a machian to see venus since its hot.They have to make sure the mechians are good to go on there so they make sure nothing happens to the mechiane. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system even through mercury is closer to our sun. That is what you learn about venus and how it is."

Why is it important to the teachers to know how their students feel about the class?

19719,0,"Dear State Senator, I truly have no opinion on the electoral college and whether or not to keep it, but as this topic insists I must write my own opinion to you and here is what I think. Even with this article sort of informing me on this topic I still seem to have a misunderstanding (or no understanding) of what the Electoral College really is or what it does. Perhaps this is because of the lack of information I'm given about our government, or perhaps its because what the electoral college does is quite irrelevant to me and my fellow peers. From what I have gathered though, the electoral college is a group of people that citizens vote for and these people are then allowed to elect a president? I am sure there is a lot more to it but from that statement which is proven true by the article, I think the electoral college is dumb. Instead of electing biased people to choose a biased president, why can't we just let the citizens elect a president; someone who appeals to us and not a large group of people that get hated on all the time. By having the electoral college it's like the government is lying to us.""Oh hey, we believe our citizens are the REAL people in charge of this country, but we aren't going to ever take off their training wheels."" Our government hasn't actually said that. but it's the kind of vibe majority of Americans get. However, there are probably plus sides to the Electoral college as well. Most people when they don't end up with the results that they weren't hoping for, will question and occuse the oppoing side. As a result of this, elections run by popular vote would always turn into a huge drama infused battle, with the losing side accusing the winning side. This could result in uneccessary recounts; delaying us of a president for even longer than it should. As I said in the beginning though, I really have no opinion on this matter nor do I truly care. What I think is we should keep things fair for our citizens but also plan ahead and think of the possible negative outcomes that could come from whatever we end up doing. So, should we keep the Electoral College? Well that's a matter that I feel should be discussed by other people. Sincerely, PROPER_NAME"
19644,0,"To who it may concern, With all the problems affiliated with the Electoral College, I believe that the United States should do away with the process. This process by which the president is elected is unfair to those of us who are old enough to vote and understand politics. Another disadvantage is that the system of Electoral College is very confusing to many people. The worst thing about the Electoral College is that it is just outright puzzling. Men who are running for a spot as a presidental candidate are not voted for by the citizens of that state. They have to gain supporters who then become the electors. Then the people of that state have to vote for the electors, not the person to become a presidental candidate. Voters can't even directly vote for who they want. What if you vote for a slate of electors, who are supposed to be in favor of the presidnetal candidate you want, but don't vote for him? What happens then? Presidental candidates who should actually get a chance at running for president because they didn't get enough electoral votes. This all leads to the next disadavntage of the Electoral College, unfairness. As stated in an article by Bradford Plumer, ""... Al Gore ---thanks to the quirks of the electoral college---won the popular vote but lost the presidency."" The person running for president should be voted for directly by the voters. Someone, such as Al Gore, can get enough of the popular votes, but not enough of the electoral votes becuase they can't swing the votes in some states. This basically means that the majority of the United States would like to have Al Gore as a president, but couldn't because the majority of people in a state didn't want him as president. To sum it up, the Electoral College should be eliminated from the presidental voting process. People should just directly vote for who they want as president and see where it goes from there."

Maybe if I have more B 's and less C 's I can participate in school activities and sports. I think that students with a C average should not participate in school activities because if the B students have to work hard for there grade so does the C students.. For the ones that do work hard should be rewarded. I will give three specific reasons why I think that students with a B grade average should participate in activities. One reason I think that students with a B grade average should participate in school activities are because they should get some kind of fun at school for doing all that hard work they had to do just to past. Students with averages like that could go far. Most schools offer a lot of scholarships to go different places. I believe that having a B grade average is good but having an A grade average is better. Another reason why students with a B grade average should participate in school activities are because they should not have to suffer with the C students that cause the B students not to do anything. I personally think that what the principal is doing is good because if he/she comes out with a policy like that then that will get the C students motivated to do better. My last reason I think that students with a B grade average should participate in school activities are because sometimes you should be rewarded for the good work that have been done. I feel that its not any reason why a students should. I say this because if the teacher is giving you the notes and all you have to do is study them to do good on your test and other activities, these C students shouldn't do not a thing. My parents don't allow C even though I have made them a couple of times. I don't like C' s because if i got all B's on my report card then i know i could have did better with that C I had. To conclude my letter those are my three specific reasons why students should not participate in school activities if they have a C average. Now that comes from my point of view of what I think about the situation but its not my decision because I don't run anything but my myself and my brain. I hope you have enjoyed my letter so far. Thanks for taking the time out to read this. Sincerely STUDENT_NAME"
12590,0,"The Face on Mars is not made by aliens. There is no proof whatsoever of any signs of life on Mars, which means no aliens. The face on Mars is just a natural landform that coincidently looks like a human face. Given the shadows and shape, the Face very much looks like it has a human nose mouth, and eyes. Although up close, there is no resemblence of a human face. Therefore, do not let this anyone fool you. Pictures have been taken by NASA of the Face to prove it is just a natural landform. Pictures taken from 1976 appear blurry, and not clear, so it is easy to believe that aliens created the Face. Although, in 1998, the pictures taken aren't as blurry, and you can see the structure of the landfrom clearly. Lastly, the picture taken in 2001 is clear and visible. You can perfectly see that close up, the Face is just another natural landform on Mars. From far away, it looks like a human face because of the shadows, but up close, it is nothing more than a simple landform. Furthermore, on 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor went back to looks for the Face again. When they snapped a photo of it, it was indeed ""ten times sharper than the photo taken in 1976."" This revealed that it was just a natural landform when the photo appeared online. ""There was no alien monument after all."" Some people who still believe that the Face was created by aliens say that ""alien markings were hidden by haze"", but the Face was only hidden because it was winter when the photo was taken. Since it was winter in April 1998, it was also the ""cloudy time of year on the Red Planet."" Therefore, the camera used had to ""peer through wispy clouds to see the Face."" This proves that aliens markings are not hidden by haze; it's the time of year where it is cloudy on Mars, making it harder to see the Face. Plus, when NASA took another picture in 2001, it was taken using the ""camera's absolute maximum solution."" Based on what I read, ""each pixel in the image spans 1.56 meters, compared to the 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" There simply can't be anything you can miss using the camera's absolute maximum solution. Jim Garvin, cheif scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, even said, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground of Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could what they where!"" Finally, NASA's explanation about the Face on Mars is based on credible information and research. People who believe aliens created the Face often get the information inside their head, making up crazy theories that aren't actually true. Furthermore, NASA went on missions to prove that the Face isn't made by aliens. They took high-quality photos that show that it is just a natural landscape. Besides making things up on their own, skeptics probably take information from the internet on websites that other skeptics have made about aliens creating the Face. You can never trust the internet, and the skeptics who made these websites probably put down their own made up facts and theories to get people to join their side. In conclusion, the Face on Mars is not created by aliens. It is just extraordinarily shaped to look like a human head, with shadows to create the illusion that it has eyes, a nose, and a mouth from far away. Up close, there is not resemblence of a human face at all. Pictures, missions, and years of research have proved it. Plus, there were no signs of aliens, or any life on Mars when they conducted this research. The Face on Mars is just a natural landform."
7043,0,"A tiresome day of school just ended, but instead of being exhausted, you are exited because your extracurricular activity is about to start. Many students go to school everyday, then leave on the bus, or walk home, until returning the next day. Because a lot of students do that, the majority of them never experience any clubs that the schools works hard to put together. By making students try out a club, they would appreciate what the school has to offer. Principals should require students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it would help students be active in the school, help kids interact with each other, and help students explore some of their interests for the future. One reason that a school's principal should require students to have to participate in at least one activity after school is so that students become active in the school once the hours of school are done. Students who stay after school for an extracurricular activity participate in some of the schools programs. This leaves a stronger connection from the students to the school. Students can choose out of many clubs offered, and therefore feel as if they found a bigger reason to stay in school. A reason that students should be required to participate in an after school activity is so they are more active in the school. Another reason that school principal should make kids participate in an after school club is so that kids can interact better with others. When students join a club in school, they meet new kids, ones with similar interests as them. Because of their shared interests, students can form a bond, all because of this club. Kids would also talk with the teachers running each club activity because they have more in common, like a passion for the club. A second reason that kids should have to participate in a extracurricular activity at school is so they learn to interact better with both students and teachers. Lastly, if a school principal made students join an after school club, students would find and explore some of their interests. Students all have their own interests and hobbies, but to find them, one would have to look. Middle and high school students are at the perfect age to explore passions because they are getting ready to pick a major in college, so they are looking high and low for an idea of what their major will be. By joining a club at your school, students will find some club that pulls at them, inviting them to join. Also, students would have time after school to try new clubs or sports. For example, an interested student could choose to participate in the yearbook committee, or even the SCA. One last reason that students should participate in an after school club is because they can figure out some of their hobbies and passions before college. In Conclusion, if a school principal required that all students must participate in some after school club, students would become more active around the school, help kids interact with each other, and help students expand their hobbies. A student would have a bigger purpose to stay at school if they had to join a club, giving them a stronger connection to the school. The interactions between students and teachers would be higher because they would have more in common. Finally, students would explore many different career paths for college and have a varied set of interests when participating in after school clubs. Principals, by making your students participate in an extracurricular activity, you help students in a lot of ways, so consider trying out this idea for a better future for your students."
19806,0,"First off i would like to tell you what a electoral college is. It is a process when a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The founding fathers established it in the constitution. The process consist of the selection of the electors where they vote for president and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. The elctoral college consist of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. Each canidate running for president in tour state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are chosen by the canidatespolitical party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. The presidential electon is held every four years on a tuesday after the first monday in november. We help choose our states electors when we vote for the president because wahen we vote for our canidates we are voting for our canidates electors. We have to save the electoral college because we have to have 270 electoral votes to have a president. If we got ride of it there would be no president or we would have to come up with an idea related to the electoral college. Thats why we should keep the elctoral college."
849,0,"Should people be allowed on their phone while driving? I think they shouldn't because that causes a lot of wrecks and other bad things. 26% of car wrecks are caused by the driver being on their phone and not paying attention. When you're driving and on your phone at the same time you're risking other people lives and yours too. There should be a new law that says there should not be any electronics placed in a moving vehicle. Plenty of people been killed in an accident because some careless human being decides to drive and text and take their eyes off the road. Another thing if you're going to have your phone in your car turn it on do not disturb or silent so when you receive a phone call or text you will not be distracted. If you get caught by the police texting while driving there should be a huge fine to make people learn their lessons. Texting while driving is basically like drunk driving either way there's an accident that's about to happen, but it can never lead up to that point if you just put the phone down. All it takes is just one little glance at your phone then BOOM!! An accident you just created. Just do everyone a favor and put the phone on hold. There's been a lot of innocent people dying because someone wants to be irresponsible and text while driving."
22172,0,Dear principal You should allow students to brings cell phones to school because you never know what could happened to them. Because something could happened to them or to someone else after school and there's no way to contact for help. And so like if there ride ain't coming after school they could call them to let them know. Another reason why they should bring their phones to school is so they could have there own time like during lunch. Because during lunch is when they get to talk so why just not let them use their phone. And so they could know about everything and no be in class looking through their phones trying to know what's going on. and like if the teacher gives them free time that will be a good time to let them check their phones. And let them use them before school like in breakfast. And if they get caught using it during class they should get a warning next time.
20043,0,"Imagine that the president the majority of the people voted for did not win because the electoral college got confused and voted for the wrong candidate. That would not happen if we didnt have a electoral college. I believe that we should change the electoral college to election by popular vote because the electoral college can cause a catastophe and is unfair. The electoral college can cause a catastophe. The electoral college is basically a disaster waiting to happen. We the people of the United States would be able to do nothing if the people of the electoral college made a mistake or even was pulling a scam. Source 2 states ""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would opose John F. Kennedy. (So that popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.)"" Many political disasters such as this would not happen if we had the election by popular vote system. The electoral college is unfair. The system is outdated and irrational as well. Source 2 states ""Because the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" Many people that are in a electoral college state don't care aould the peoples vote and sometimes might even want to vote for the people who they want to vote for! Source 3 states ""The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidates recieve a majority of the votes cast."" In my opinion, this is exactly the problem. The american people have the right to do a tie breaker not the electoral college. To conclude, the electoral college should be changed to the election by popular vote. There is not reason that the electoral college should still be the way we vote because it is not a stable way of casting votes (disaster prone) and it is unfair."
9943,0,"Is the Facial Action Coding System Useful in Classrooms? What if there was a machine capable of not only reconizing, but also understanding feelings via facial expressions? There actually is a machine that could do that. It is called the Facial Action Coding System, or FACS. This technology could be very useful in classrooms, it could reconize the emotions of the students, it could help identify or even prevent certain situations before they even happen by identifying a problem, and it could help give teachers much needed feedback on the class that they wouldn't verbally recieve. FACS constructs a 3-D model of the face. It takes into account all 44 maajor facial muscles to determine the feelings or emotions of a person. For example, if you raise your forntalis pars lateralis, or the mucles above your eyes, you are displaying surprise. Using this technology in classrooms could help learn the emotions of students and show how they are feeling. Identifying emotions in the classroom could be very useful. Students on average sit in classrooms for 6-8 hours a day. Their emotions are still developing and they themselves are still maturing. Sometimes, students may have breakdown or outburst because of various reasons. A student might be stressed out about their grades and begin to preform poorly. Usinng FACS this behavior could be predicted and prevented, letting the teacher know that that student needs a little extra encouragement or more academic assitment. Also, the school enviroment has many variables aside from classrooms alone and that could also cause problems. A student who becomes angry at their classmates has the possibilty of putting them in trouble, It coould either lead to a fight, confrontation, bullying, an other things. Yet, if the problem could be determined becore it could even start, it could help defuse or prevent the situation from escalating resulting in a safer learning enviroment. Considering this FACS could become a very useful additions to the schools as a community. FACS could not only help the school as a whole, but more specifically, it could help the teachers. Dr. Huang claimes that, "" Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" Using this statement we can recognize that not all information and feedback is being recieved by neither student nor teacher. A teacher's job is to help educate and prepare their students for the future. However, that becomes difficult when a single teacher has to take responsibilty of a large ammount of students. Some students express their concerns and questions but others choose to remain silent. Using FACS a teacher could now determine which students are confused and worried and which students are doing fine. By using this information a teacher could offer additional help for a student that a student wouldn't normally ask for. Knowing where to focus on and which students need help could help a teacher tremendously. It would facilitate a teacher's job and help them teach with greater efficientcy. Facs would recognize student's emotions, help identify and prevent certain situations before they occur, and it would give teachers feedback on the class that they wouldn't recieve otherwise. FACS would help education by targeting students that are well of and students that need additional help instead of having a teacher assume the whole class is confused or content. FACS is an innovative piece of technoly that could bring forth a new age of education if placed in schools."

From the ""...birth place of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized ""'Mustang Sally'""(The End of Car Culture, Rosenthal) Cars and automobils have impacted our everyday lifes from going to the store to hanging out with friends, but car usage has been stedily decreesing and for all the right reasons. A new movemnent is trending everywhere, it's called ""smart planning"". It's simple, separate subarban life from auto use. In doing so this movement is going to help out the econdomy and also the enviorment. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 perecent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" [empheses on original] That many emissions are horrible for the enviorment and even worse for our pockets, because they're just going up in smoke. New cities are rising and are acctuly trying to adopt this trend by making cities denser, which means that all the stores and your work place are in walking distance. By being able to walk to your local shopping store or favorite move theatre means that you're saving gas, and by saving gas the ecodimey is saving money which will make prices in all the stores and other bussnesses cheaper for the consumer, you! The infamous smog is not only in Bejing, or the United States, but also in The City of Love. ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals...[Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London..."" (Paragraph 17, Duffer) The city is not so lovely as you'd think it would be, but the trend has cought on in Paris! Not only that but it also has been great for the enviorment. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog...[The smog] rivaled Begjing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" (Paragraph 14, Duffer) Most people would think ""I could never do that! No one could live like that and still make a living!"" Honestly though, it's been doing the city of Bogota in Colombia, a city comprimised of 7 million citizens a favor. They held a event for only one day evey year since the mid 1990s to improve and ""...promote alternive transportation and reduce smog."" (Paragraph 21, Selsky) Doing this has sparked a revolution of change thoughout the whole city. More people are willing to walk insted of drive to help the enviorment and the place they live in, and the city is giving right back to them! ""Parks and sports centers have also bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut trafic; and new restaruants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" (Paragraph 28, Selsky) Just one day a week could cut down smog and other green house gasses a lot and help our enviroment and the edodomey. Back in the 1950's people had to use cars to do eveything. From talking to a friend face to face to going to the nearest resturant. But now you can do all of that in your own living room, due to technology that has advanced us to be able to use Facetime, Skype, or Oovoo to talk to our friends face to face using out phone, tablet, or personal computer. And to drive anywhere we need to we have apps the diliver taxies to our houses for us.""...the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends...Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps have facilitated more flexiable commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared can services fro getting to work."" ( Paragraph 35, Rosenthal) Working everyday will effect this because no one wants to miss work. Missing work means less money and creates more stress for the person missing work. By saving maybe $10 on gas that day you're missing out on the $125 you could've made by working, but there's another solution to this also. Car-pool! Even if you're driving the car yourself or you're in the car you're saving fule and money. Once a week you could to this to stop in increes of smog in our enviorment and even help with traffic jams. And without traffic jams eveyone is less stressed out and a lot more happier. By not using our cars as much, we can help ourselves and everyone aroud us by making a better world that makes it better for our children, or even our childrens' children. We can save money by just taking one day off of not driving. We should limit car use so we can stop car accedents from happening, getting stressed in traffic jams, to helping out the economical heart of the United States, and just to make our world a better place to have fun and thrive in."

It appeared on Hollywood films, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even the haunted grocery store for 25 years. The face is on the planet Mars and other people thought it was a face of an alien of some kind. They thought that because it looked like it had a nose,pair of eyes, and a mouth. The first picture of the face on mars was in 1976 which is called the Viking photo. The second was taken by Mars Global surveyor (MGS) form 1998. Finally, the third image was the latest image from MGS in 2001. A few scientists believed it was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars MGS arrived at the Red Planet inseptember 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended. April 5,1998 MGS flew over Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, revealing a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter April '98, a cloudy time of the year on the Red Planet. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze. What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common around the American West. It reminds Jim Garvin most of Middle Butte in the Snake River. The Face on Mars became very popular and showed on many events like the television, newspaper articles, books, and the checkout area in grocery stores for 25 years."
25467,0,"In life people will have problems that they will need advice on how to deal with them. If they only have one choice on dealing with something, then it would not be as fair as if they had multiple choices. The more choices a person has on one problem, the better life and the outcome will be for that person weather it is about life, a relationship, or maybe a friend. when you are in a relationship, you need to always have a group of friends that you can go to and talk about your problems with your partner. For a example, lets say your partner lies to you about something that is not really important but important at the same time. You go talk to a friend about it and they tell you to go retaliate and you end up losing your partner forever over something that was not worth losing them. If you go to a group of friends and they all give you different ways of dealing with it then you can think about which one is better for everyone. Having choices make everything easier in life. Another example would be school, think about your grades, group of friends that you hang out with, and about yourself. Lets say you have a big test coming up this week but you wanna play the game with your buddies so you ask your group of friends who do not get good grades what you should do and they say to forget about the test and go play with them. then you ask your grandma or grandpa who have already been through all of that and they tell you to go study. Now you have choices you can either go play the game and take that chance on getting a bad grade or study for the test and possibly get a great grade. Finally about this thing we call life. Lets say this is your first year in high school and you feel like everything is ripping you apart, so you talk to your older family members and they all give you different responses. You now have been given choices, you can choose to keep trying to be the coolest and most popular kid in the school or be the smartest in the school and start focusing on keeping your grades up and go somewhere in life. People will always need choices in life or more people will end up ruining their lives because they feel like they do not have a choice. When people have choices they think of the outcome of each choice and that helps them pick which one is right. this is why the more choices you have the better your life will turn out."

23397,0,"Is taking online classes more beneficial than attending a class? Attending a class helps individuals not only be social with other students on campus but also be social with their teachers as well! Therefore, because of taking online classes, students would have a decrease in social activity. Another reason why taking online classes are not the best option is because of the use of technology. Technology has a major impact on human health. Therefore, taking online classes to taking conference calls, the use of technology can be deceiving. Student can cheat off an online test of they wanted too because they would have no one around them to confirm that they had cheated. Technology is being used constantly throughout the world today however, it has a major impact on human health. For example, technology impacts eye sight by worsening ones vision to see correctly, plays a major part in cyberbullings which might lead to suicide, and distracts one while driving which leads to car crashes. Technology can be efficient at times when needed but also be inefficient too. For instance, going to bed late just because you were on your phone all night playing games or having a test the next day and being on your phone instead of studying for that one test. Staring at a computer all day taking online classes, tests, or even a conference call would be a major impact on ones body therefore, attending classes would be way more safer and efficient than taking online classes. According to many students in colleges today, they would more likely attend a class on campus rather than taking online classes. Would you like to stare at a computer all day or would you like to be in a class were you can verbally learn and talk to your peers? What if you were taking an online test and you have the resources to cheat would you? No one would be around you to confirm that you cheated or not. This would become a lot easier for a college student that is taking online classes rather than for a college student attending classes no campus because the students attending classes would not have the resources needed to cheat. If the kids attending classes cheat they are suspended for that college but what if the online kids cheat? Would they be of the hook? Today, I see students from my high school cheat when no one is around, those students that cheat will carry on old habits. Making students much more incapable of taking a test on their own. I feel that students that cheat from high school while sign up for online classes so that school would become much more efficient to them. Being social is important, while in school or out of school! It's highly important to be social when you are going to college or going to a new school. Taking online classes prevents you from being social therefore, attending a class will help you be social with friends, teachers, and other students on campus. You have to be social when make friends or introducing yourself to teachers. The only way you can be social when taking online classes is when you are having a conference call. Being social, the impact of technology on human health, and the many ways students can cheat online rather than in the classroom all are the reasons why online classes should not be recommended to anyone and should be banished for all campuses. At the end of the day its one opinion on if online classes are beneficial or not. I believe that some students just don't have the social functions to want talk to anyone and decided to do online classes instead of attending the classes in person."

He explains and shows the dangers Venus has to offer and how scientists and are fascinated in trying to overcome these obstacles without any casualties. The dangers of Venus has made it difficult for missions to succeed in previous explorations. In paragraph 2 it states,""...since no spacecraft survived the landing for more han a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why no a single spaceship has touched down on Venus.."" Venus's dangerous climate makes it difficult in this way. In paragraph 3 it states,""Venus has the hottest surface tamperature of any planet in our solar system,.."" With these obstacles Venus provides, scientists are trying to overcome these obstacles to explore the similar features that we see on Earth today. In paragraph 5 it states,""...(NASA) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans ro study Venus...a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way."" Another way they are trying to avoid casualies are by using silicon carbide. In paragraph 7 it says,""...electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface...lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" With these support claims by the author, it provides an idea to go into pursuit despite the dangers that Venus throws at us. Explaining the experiments and ideas planned to take on Venus, gives a more positive outlook on exploring our sister planet."
25793,0,"Making a choice is not always an easy thing to do. Wether it's tyring to figure out what you should order on the menu, or a bigger decision like which college you should attend. However big or small the choice is, there are always people around you that can help you find the answer and give you their input on what you should do. Asking for the advice of people you trust can be really eye opening. Seeking advice from multiple people can help you make your decision much more clear and help you make a better choice. Sometimes, all it takes is a few people's input that will impact your life. Talking to multiple people about a decision can help someone make a better choice because if everyone you're talking to is saying to do the same decision, then your choice becomes a lot more clear. If you seek advice from many people, and most or all of those people are saying the same thing, then the choice becomes much more clear. For example, if you're debating wether or not to take all honors next year, and all of your teachers are telling you you should do honors, then the choice to take all honors becomes clear. Seeking advice from only one person might not make your mind up as quickly as talking to many people. Having one of your teachers telling you to do all honors might not be as impactful as having most of your teachers telling you to do all honors. Another reason why talking to more than one person about a choice is helpful is because you can recieve new options that you haven't even thought of before. Talking to multiple people can make you think of new ideas on what to do. If you are really not sure about a decision, people can show you many paths of which you can go down. Having another option can make your decision even more clear. For example, if you're deciding over going to Greece or Italy for your vacation, and other people you talk to are mentioning Paris, you might consider going to Paris instead which you haven't even thought of in the first place. Another reason why talking to multiple people about a decision can help someone make a better choice is because you can learn from people's past experiences. Learning about people's past experiences can really change your perspective. If you're talking to multiple people about wether to do something or not, and those people say not to because it didn't go well for them in the past, then the choice to not do that certain something becomes much more clear. For example, if you're not sure if you want to go cliff-diving, and the people you talk to are all saying you shouldn't because they got hurt while doing it, then the choice becomes pretty clear to not go cliff-diving. Talking to multiple different people about a decision can be very helpful because you can get different point of views. Getting different point of views and opinions can be helpful sometimes because it can make you think totally different from what you were thinking before. It can lead to new paths you want to go down. Though getting different point of views can also be tricky sometimes because it can make you even more conflicted then you already were. But a lot of the time, different opinions can lead to more options and oppurtunities. Getting other people's input on a choice is important because if you're really split on a decision, the people you seek advice from might make the choice a lot more clear. If you really trust the people you seek advice from, then your choice should be made easily. There's nothing wrong with seeking advice from others sometimes. Sometimes making choices on your own can be very difficult and all it takes is other peoples' different opinions and point of views. You might just need to hear that advice that pushes you into the right direction."
11529,0,"The Facial Action Coding System created by Dr. Paul Eckman, it is a man-made computer, in which it constructs a 3-D computer model of the face. Many would say that this new break in technology is useless, but there is more that meets the eye when it comes to the Facial Action Coding System. This coding system can read the emotional expressions of any student in a classroom! This is extreamly useful as it can recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, it will then modify the lesson to fit the needs of that student, and human communication is nonverbal so therfore the computers are trained to react like a human in any situation. When a child is sitting in a classroom with many other students while the teacher is explaining a lesson plan, they might fall to boredom or simply be confused. Many students could say, that they have at one point or another felt overwhelmed by a certain lesson in their classroom. The Action Coding System can, as said by Dr. Huang, ""..recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" Imagine having a computer that would allow you to read into the emotion of a student. This device could be the greatest asset to any teacher. Many students will subside their emotion for the thought of being cast out by their peers for not understanding a lesson, now with the Action Coding System created a student will not feel the pressure of being discriminated against, and teachers have a reliable source of technology to make sure their classrooms are being used to the best of their ability. As well, the Action Coding System not only can scan a student's emotions, but when it finds a student confused or bored, it will modify the lesson for the child. As said by Dr, Huang, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This piece of technology can even modify a lesson plan for a child struggeling to understand the curriculum or a student who struggles with ADHD. A teacher with this device could always know what is happeing in her class and how his/her students are feeling. In a sense, the teacher can have a weight lifted off their soldiers as he/she knows all students are taken care of. Finally, the Action Coding System is wired to run like an actual human being. Therefore, since humans are mostly nonverbal, the system will produce in the same way. Dr. Huang said, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, So computers need to understand that, too.""The computers will work in the same sense as an actual human. In a classroom, the students and teacher will feel as if they are being cared for by an actual human other than a piece of metal and plastic. This is a key attribute in the foundation of the product, as it is better to have a new technology that acts like a human, rather then a robot that tries to contol. In conclusion, the Action Coding System is a must have in any classroom. It can recogzine when a student is becoming confused or bored, it can then modify the lesson, and it runs functionally like a human being. This piece of technology is universal and has a vivid array of uses."
23057,0,"Does the study environment really affect students to study knowledge? There is a lot of people be success from the slum. When they are in the school period, They don't have much modern equipment for them to use, and also do not have a experience teacher to teach them, but they are success finally. I think the environment are not important for students study, as long as you are a hard working student and always pay attention when teacher is talking, you will be the next success person in this world. So for students attend classes in home or in school, it means same things, it's all depend on which students. It doesn't matter in which place or environment, a good student are never make himself fall. So I think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. First of all, if students are attend classes from home, I think the students can be more focus on their class, because no one can distracting you, It is impossible. You can only sit on your chair in your room, and then put all of your attention on your online class. For this scene I can make a example, you are just wake up in your bed, and your parent are already go to work. Then, watch the clock, you remind that today is still a school day, and it's the timing for you to open your computer and go to the online class to study. Next, let's image, the house is almost empty except you, no one can talk to you, only the quiet air fill the house. In this moment, you hear the sounds from the computer, yep, it's Generic_Name! Generic_Name is a good math teacher, he is always coming on time, you really love him. After the several hours, he is teach all of the students who is on the online class to solve some math questions. That's the scene will happen I believe if the students are attend online classes from home. No one can distract you and you can focus the class. Second, if students are attend classes from home, it can reduce a lot of time from the move, like some students may walk to school or some may get bus go to the school, it both takes much time. So reduce time is very important for students. For a example, as a student, I feel so tired when I was wake up on 7:00 am in every morning. And then, get the bus go to school. When bus arrive to school, I still have to waiting until the first period start, yup, 8:10 am. It cost 1 hour from when I wake up to the first period start. So on the other hand, let's try the way on online class, I can wake up around the 7:55 am, 15 minute is enough for me to do something like wash tooth and face etc, It reduce 55 minute. Recently, I saw a data report from the internet, it shows young teens at least need to have 8 hour for sleep everyday. For me, I think 9 hour is better, so I care about that 55 minute, it can make me feel more energy in morning. So if you are the students like me, and your school have the online classes option open, don't worry and stop wasting your time, just apply for it, trust me you will not feel regret for this decision in the future. Third, if students are attend classes from home, then you will not have to worry about the food. For my personal experience, many students will feel hungry when they are in school, because the lunch time is too late, study knowledge are steal too much energy from our body. So if we are attend class in our home, we can eat anything we want in anytime, even is science class. Also, I think the lunch in school is not that health as we think, especially for some fat people although I not. I always believe if the food is cooking by myself or my parent is more delicious and health, because we know which food is good for us, we know some small detail that they don't know, like what source should add to this food, or what kind of meat is my favorite etc. That's home, the other place can't beyond it. So if you are the students really love the food that making by yourself or you are the students often feel hungry in the class, just apply for the online classes, you will know the feeling when you are eating the food while focus to teacher, its like you're stand in heaven. In conclusion, above is the reason why I think the students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Many people know that study knowledge is the most important things for everyone, it doesn't matter in where. But if we have the free to choose the places, we can choose the place that we are more comfortable with. So if you are the students love to sleep more longer, love the food is cook by yourself, or you are the students hate other to distract you. Then, you can consider to apply online classes, there is still have the unlimited benefit that I didn't show you. When you are really attend online classes, those benefit will become the surprise to you. Last, As long as you are work hard, be serious to every work, kind to others, the gold are always shiny, no matter it is stand under floor or on top of a building."

Dr. huang saw that artists studie human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles to also so emotions as it states in paragh 5. This could help out teachers and students alot. Students would not have to be scared when they are confused, teachers would know that you do not get it so they can help you out till you do get it. When u are just having a bad day teachers would know that and so they dont get on you for being angry when they call on you or try to talk to you. This is why i am for using technology to read students emostions expressions."
11146,0,In emtions there are different ways you can tell if a person is happy or sad but you have you ever thought you could be everyone of them at once. I feel like you cant know for certian what people are feeling becasue people only know what they truly feel. There are ways you cant tell for examples by there facial muscles. You can tell the differenece from a real smile or a fake smile. For a guniene smile you will seee that the cheeck bones lift up the corner of your mouth. If its a fake smile your face streaches sideways. You can also tell by taking a test of a computer. You can immaute other peoples emotions. For example if your showing empthly for someone. I feel like a person can feel a lot of different emotions and that may not be the true one but you can try to figure it out by doing these things. It has helped me learn how to figure of people emotions better and especially when you take a pic with them.
12455,0,When you say that the face on mars is an alien artifact how do you know. Prove to me that it is. So you can't well quess what. I can prove to you that it is not an alien artifact. All I have to do is use knowledge that I have from the evidence. In the story it says that people made a movie about the face on mars. It has also been put in many magazines. It has also been put in haunted grocerey store check out lines. All of that is just to draw attention. All though it did they just want you to think that because they wanted money. Sence people thought that the face was an alien artifact N.A.S.A made photographing it a main priority. On a JPL website they revieled that the face was a landmark and nothing more. The face on mars was located at 41 degrees north martian latitude were it was winter. This was a cloudy time on the planet mars. It may have messed with the picture a little bit anyway. Some mission controles prepared to look again. It's very hard to locate the face sence the camera scans the planet like a fax machine. They dont just come across it very often. They evan used a special camera that zooms in very close to the planet. They still saw that the planets face was nothing more than a landform. In conclusion the face is nothing. There were no alien artifacts. So that should prove to you. That there were not aliens. It's nothing more than a simple landform.

174,0,"Phones and Driving Today in society people all have a cell phone to call, text or explore things that may interest them. They also have access to a vehicle (Car, Truck, RV, Etc.) to which they can drive from place to place. Phones and vehicles are the same since both are a privilege to have and are not a basic human right. The use of allowing one to drive a vehicle while he or she uses a phone is an interesting topic to discuss. Both are also what teenagers are expected to get when they reach the age of 16. In my opinion I believe that phones should not be used while a driver is driving. Driving is important to reduce time to get from one place to another. It can be dangerous to drive if one does not focus on the road. If someone is driving and they waste a second on their phone they could harm or possibly kill someone for not looking who is in front of them. Driving with a phone or in your lap could even distract you long enough to not get the steering wheel and may worsen one's driving skills. Also if one decides to drive with their phone they are not just putting everyone else at risk, they're putting themselves at risk as well. According to a statistic 58% of teen crashers are because of distracted driving. Meaning that without the use of their phone more than half of teen crashes would be reduced and less harm would be done. Another study states ""Text messaging increases the risk of crash or near-crash by 23 times."" Meaning that just receiving or glancing at the phone for a second could cause a crash. However, phones can or should be used only in an emergency. An example is when one needs directions to get to a location that is fine to use the phone. If there is Bluetooth, then connect it to the cell phone if it is compatible to focus more on the road. Or if you need to use your phone just find somewhere to park or stop somewhere and use your phone there. Unless it is for an emergency or something of great importance this is the only time a phone should be allowed. In conclusion, phones should not be allowed to be used while in a car. Text messages and phone calls themselves cause unnecessary to both civilians and to oneself. WORK CITED Learn the Facts About Distracted Driving. (n. d.).

15858,0,"Dear Principle, I think that your idea for people who have at least a B average to be in activities is really not the greatest idea you could do for us. I will give three reasons for being against this idea. I don't have a B average and am in band and I love it but if you take it away from me and my other band friends we will really be upset. I think that people should be in activities even if they don't have at least a B average. Everyone loves doing activities even if their grades are down, it makes school even more fun then it already is. If you take it away from us kids, we wont like school anymore. People would go to school and look forward to the fun activities that are in place for them. I even know some people who are failing classes and do sports. I think you should do at least a C average or even a D average for some students but don't ruin our school lives. When parents hear about this their children will be depressed and beg them to tell you to put activities back at school. Parents will help their child put their grade up but what happens if the student is struggling? Depression will hit them if that child does sports and doesn't get to play if they fail one single class. Everyone doesn't like going to a boring school with no after school activities just because of their C average and all their other friends get all the fun. If you passed this I would get kicked out of band because of this. Don't so this to us students. Some of us are the best acting students and could be your best yet. You wouldn't be here without us. We don't deserve this at all. I hope you change your mind if you do pass this. Your student, STUDENT_NAME"
106,0,"A large majority of the population has a smart phone or some other devise like it. A lot of these people think they cannot live without their phone being on their person. This causes people to be distracted while driving, and causing crashes. They do have other things they can use like the hands free in their cars. They also have the very high possibility of being pulled over and given a ticket by police. All these are more than enough reason to stop driving with a phone. In America 28% of the crashes happen because of a phone using distracted driver. This is freighting to me because all it takes is one person on their phone to crash into someone else and possibly take their life. This is a danger to anyone and their vehicle on the roadways making people unconfident while driving. Motorcyclist also have an even greater danger as they are harder to see even for non-distracted drivers so the danger is multiplied. In 2019 most cars on the road have a hands-free devise built in to the car. This helps many people not use their phone and keep his or her eyes on the road. A lot of people that text and drive may not even know such a thing exists, but if they use this then they will greatly reduce the chance of a fatal crash. A lot of states now have laws against having your phone in your hand while driving at all now. You will run the risk of getting pulled over and receiving a ticket with a large fine from them. I am glade that they do this as it makes people think twice before picking up their phone for an unnecessary text and causing an accident. People need to realize that other people's lives are not less important than their phones. In conclusion I believe that people should not be able to use their phones in the car. Using the phone can cause you to be distracted and lose control of your car. There are safer ways of going about this like use the cars hands-free systems. And finally the fact that you could be given a ticket should make you think twice before using your phone. There is just too much at risk to be driving distracted."

I think this is true because the more you know about something the e better and Easier for you to pick choice. Imagine this, you find out your mail was robbed. You know that the mail always comes at 2:30 and you saw when the mail man came and dropped it in front of your house. Then you saw two teens walking in front of your house. You might quickly regconise them and quickly call the cops but they wont get arrested on the spot. The police will have to have witnesses,and the teens Point of View of the story I always ask my friends what they think about something before making my final answer. If people give you more opinions about something you will know like the pros and cons of what ever your asking about. Thats why i always ask my friends to give me there point of view in things, its easier for me to pick a choice between just by knowing whats better for me. Point of views will always help you doesnt matter what problem you have because you can literally figure an answer quickly. I conclude my statement by saying point of views can really help you out no matter what and i just explained to you why."
16838,0,"In our current day and age we are making monumental discoveries and breakthroughs in technology and medicine. Mankind has risen above any previous prowess it has ever seen. In addition to the dumbfounding advances in technology already made, we have many more waiting just aruond the corner. Among these new discoveries is the autonomous car. However their seem to be many problems that could arrise with these driverless cars such as potential malfunctions in technology, legal liability difficulties in case of a crash, and the fact that they might turn on us. While the idea of driverless cars may seem far off it is actually much closer than most would pressume, with Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan all planning to relearse autonomous cars by 2020 as seen in paragraph ten of the source document. However, one of the obsticles of the driverless car is the potential for the technology to malfunction. ""Some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over"", if the technology formerly mentioned were to malfunction the potential injury and death would be imminent. With the incident of a crash involving an autonomous car invlolved many legal issues would arise. Foremost among these potential legal disputes would be that of liabilty. While paragraph nine reveals that the majority of states do not allow autonomous cars, ""Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers. Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars."", the problem of liability, weather it be the driver or the manufacturer at fualt, still arises. At the very forefront of all of the issues and potential problems with the idea of the autonomous car is the imminent, unavoidable threat that they would undoubtedly turn on us. As seen in Terminator 3 Judgement Day, the technology would gain a mind of its own and begin to destroy all of the humans. The cars would begin to crash themselves and run down helpless pedestrians with cute little puppies and ice cream. Most likely the cars would soon adapt after the military got involved and begin to mount machine guns, artillery and any other gun the could think of or pruduce. they would being to be made with faces and would look like a cross between Arnold and Lightning McQueen. dropping out of autonomous helicopters to destroy us all with their evilishy cute murderous faces. While there are many other reasons and evidences for not prudicing the machine which will kill us the three most important have been touched upon today. Therefore because of the potential malfuntcion in technology, legal obscurities and impening armageddon and war between man and machine the autonomous car should not be produced or pursued any further. In conclusion, aim for the head, do not get bitten and beware the machines."
25960,0,"Have you ever been in a sticky situation, and needed some strong advice? I assume you went and talked to more than one trusted person. If you didn't I'll tell you why you should have. When seeking for advice you should talk to more than one person because, there will be a variety of opinions, you can learn from many individuals' mistakes, and the people giving advice can share many experiences, not just one. When many people are asked to give advice, there will be a variety of opinions. That means everyone will have a different point of view on the issue or situation. The multiple opinions makes it better for you to receive advice. One individual's standpoint is bias, because they only believe in one thing. On the other hand, many individuals' standpoint isn't bias, the reason being: everyone thinks different. People are human, they make mistakes and errors, but we wouldn't be able to learn and grow without them. Just learning from your own mistakes is helpful, but imagine learning from multiple people and their mistakes. You might not even realize how learning from the mistakes of people is such a habit. For example if you're walking on the street and see someone trip on a pothole, you obviously are going to know not to trip on the pothole. Another example for instance is if you know someone that made friends with an unkind person, most likely you would stay away from that person. Just think about how you could avoid making a ton of mistakes by listening to others and their accidents. If you seek advice from a person, they are probably wiser and more experienced. It's common sense why you get advice from someone older, wiser, more experienced, or smarter than you. A five year old most likely couldn't give outstanding advice to a twenty year old. One wise statement of advice could get someone far, but multiple wise statements from many people is much better. The final verdict is that it is much better to seek advice from many people, compared to only one or just yourself. You will have a variety of options and opinions, you can learn from many individuals' mistakes, and you can get advice from people with different experiences. So next time you're stuck in a sticky situation and you don't know what to do, think about getting advice from multiple people."
8977,0,"Venus, Future planet earth? Should we take more risks and stop being limited by danger and doubts? I think that the author give such good information to support his idea that studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers. My first reason about i think the author give good information is because he actually uses real information about spacecrafts that did not survive the landing in Venus for more than a few hours. But then he restate this facts and he says: ""If Venus is so inhospitable, why are scientist even discussing further visits to its surface? And he answers this question saying that it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system so then it's a good idea to try landing its surface. The author also recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, but then he ask himself, What are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive? He start explaining that the NASA's possible solution for that issue is a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way, and that idea makes me agree with the author because it is real information about the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. To conclude my essay that the author supported very well his idea, he gave a lot of important information about Venus and also about why it's a good idea to start studying this planet. We have to start meeting the very edges of imagination and innovation."
22351,0,"Offering distance learning with online classes is a terrible idea and is not beneficial to students in anyway. Not only does it take away the chance for a student to physically communicate properly; it also is completely unfair to less fortunate students who dont have technological resources and it irradiates the opportunity for students to physically ask questions and comprehend the material. Overall, online teaching will have a negative impact on students and should not be implemented into our school system. Students learn how to communicate with others through their years in the school system. That opportunity can easily be taken away with the help of online teaching. For example, if one were to compare two completely different lifestyles, one where the person interacts with people physically and one where the person only interacts virtually, one could notice that their social interactions will differentiate drastically. The person who is not use to interacting with other people will be more awkward and shy; they will most likely be classified as socially awkward. Meanwhile, the person who physically interacts with people will blossom in an environment where they have to constantly talk to others and will be seen as a social butterfly. This example shows that human interaction is a nessisity and without it humans would not be able to properly communicate meaning that physical school is also a nessisity. Making school virtual is a horrible plan, especially regarding less fortunate students. For instance, one could imagine that a child and their parents were apart of the lower class. The child lives in section 8 housing and can not afford new clothes. He is malnurished and always hungry. The only chance that this child has in being successful and helping out his family is school. If this child does well in school and gets a scholarship, then he will be given the opportunity to get the proper training to get a great job that pays well and he will be able to help his family out. If the school system required all students to use technology in order to get access to classes, then that child would have lost all hope in being successful because his parents would not be able to afford any technology that could access the online courses. Therefore, making school virtual provides an inequitable environment for students who can not afford technology. Online school can be a frustrating thing for some students because some words and phrases can be interpreted differently if the tone of voice is unavailable. It will also be difficult for students to clarify their confusion to their instructor without physical communication. In theory, one student could have a question about one of the assignments and decides to email the teacher about it. Then the teacher responds with, ""I'm not going to help you; figure it out yourself,"" in a sarcastic tone. Depending on the student's mood and the student's familiarity with the teacher, the student could read the phrase in a disrespectful manner and could potentially be highly offended. Then one could imagine that the student, who just wanted to clear up a misconception with her assignment, is now discouraged and will never truly understand that the teacher was joking. The whole situation could have been avoided if the student and the instructor were both physically interacting with each other. Thus making online school a negative system for students. Some could argue that being out of school gives student more time to do other activities like chores and family socials, but this statement is completely false. The reasoning behind why the statement is false is that whether or not one were to be in school or out of school does not effect the length of each class, nor does it shorten the amount of material that must be learned in a certain subject. So if it normally takes an hour and a half to learn history in a physical school building, then it would still take an hour and a half to learn history whilst taking the course online. So overall, turning our school system into a virtual school is a horrid idea because of the lack of communication, unequal resources, and because of how easy it is for things to be misconstrued."
15644,0,"Dear Principle, changing the policy is a good idea, because many people have c average, and if they play any sports, they might get a lower average than a c. Also they have to focus on their school work first than the sports, and like I said before playing sports might get them failing. Also, if nobody is making a change, on their grades than maybe she could change it but, meanwhile she should keep it to a b average to play any sports or to be in any activity, the students are going to try their best at making good grades to play sports. It is good in many reasons to keep a good average, because then they get their report card or their progress reports and they see that they have a low average, it is going to be because they are focusing to much in their sports or activities. The principle should first see how the students react to the changing, and if it works than, yea keep it, but she can always change it. It doesn't matter if they have a high C, but then need to have a B. Most students would argue about having to study, but i think its for their own good, also the school will change, for example, the school recognized for having a C average ad letting them play sports or do any activities, that could change if the students try hard enough and change the C to a B, then the school will recognized by having a B average on, most of the students. The reason that its best for students to have good grades, its because also at the end of the year if they don't have a good average, they will not be able to pass the year. Back to the point it will be challenging, but I'm sure the students that love playing sports or being part of school activities, those people will actually try and make those grades, but if for some reason, those people who tried their best, like they went to tutoring, did all their home and school work, and turned it in, then you might want to check in with his/her teachers and see if they want to let them participate, but everyone can make at least a B, not an A but a B, because we all are very smart, some smart as others, but yes I'm sure, it will all work out, but if they keep on complaining, and they don't actually try to do their best, and they slack off, go to sleep in class they you won't see a difference n their grades, then that's their lost, because we want our school to be recognized, with all of out players with a B. one of the reasons why i want the students to have a good average, its because, those who want to succeed will try until they get it right, but if you are the person who doesn't care, then whose fault is that? So i would like to have that policy. As i told you before, everyone is smart enough to pass their grades, even if, they don't think so. It wont be so bad, either, to try your best at school, even if you just do it for sports, but i you were the type of person that was failing, then now you can say that you are passing all of your classes, don't think of what other people have to say, just do it for yourself."

This makes it easier for teenagers to communicate with friends and not lose friendships. They can be used to talk to other students and keep up with their homework. They can be used in emergency situations. An example could be if a student forgot his or her lunch they could call their guardian and tell them to bring lunch to school. Or if a student is seriously hurt they could call an ambulance to help them. Cell phones can help students stay out of trouble and become a better students. Students could help each other by texting notes during lunch or in the morning if a notebook is forgotten. Cell phone can cut down on weight students have to carry because of books by texting assignments. Cell phones can also help students remember things like tests or homework. Teens could also call a friends parents for a ride home or to stay at their friends home to study. Cell phone can be a very useful tool if used properly. Your's Truly, STUDENT_NAME"

9755,0,"Is studying Venus worth the dangers it presents to people? This topic is often debated, many want to but cannot seem to overcome the atmoshperic conditions. The author of this article thinks it is worth exploring. The modern electronics wouldn't survive,it's tempurature is 800 degrees and NASA's sulotion has even greater diffficulties. The third paragraph in this article the author discusses the planets atmopshere and temperature. The atmosohere surronding Venus is 97 percent carbone dioxide,a gas deadly to humans. The clouds around Venus are very corrosive sulfuric acid, and the pressure is 90 times greater then on earth. The temperature at the surface is 800 degrees. These climates are far more extreme than any climate on eath. The author does not give a very good reason the danger are worth it in this peregraph. These dangers could very easily end a life of any person willing ot explor Venus. In paragraph four the author discusses how NASA wants to send people to study venus. They do not currently have any invintions that would allow humans to be on the sufrace of Venus. They are purposing a vehicle similar to a blimp that would travel 30 miles above the surface of Venus. The heat would still be a 170 degrees, but the pressure would be survivable. However in paragraph six the author continues to shut down ideas, that would prove their point. They talk about how the atmosphere is so dense that light would not be able to penetrate it. Then continues to talk about how they couldnt gather rock,gas or any other samples. They also state that standered photography and videagraphy would be useless. In paraghrap seven the author goes over the aproaches of tecnology. They say NASA is working on some electronics made of siclicon carbide,though they are simplified they lasted three weeks in a simulatution of Venuses atmosphere. They are also working on old technology. The devices were first thougt of in the 1800s and played a big part during world war two. The devices used levers and gears to make calculations. They do not work as quickly as modern computers but are less sensetive to extreme conditions. Over all the author of this article did a poor job supporting this idea. They made many claims, but the counter claims seemed to take more importance. In the last paragraph the author seems to support the idea better then in the rest of the article."
10155,0,"The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because being able to detect the students emotions can be very beneficial to many instructors and teachers in different ways. It will be efficient because it will let the teachers to know what the students are interested in or what they like, instead of trying to figure it out on their own. Also, the students will be able to get a better understanding of what they like to do during school and what helps them learn. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" according to Dr. Huang. This could help the teachers and instructors to know if they need to change anything about the way they are making the students learn. For example, if it shows the student being bored, they could do an activity that is more interactive and involved, rather than just sitting there and doing a worksheet. Also, if they seem confused, it gives you an opportunity to help that individual one on one. You are able to go at their pace and be patient with them so they can learn it in their own way. Overall, this technology could be very beneficial and efficient in the school environment. It is going to help teachers gather knowledge about their teaching styles and if they need to change any thing about the way they are making students learn. Also, this is helping students to realize the certain ways that they learn and giving them knowledge as to their likes and dislikes of school. The new technology allows the teachers to have options as to what they do throughout the school day that interests the stufent and helps them learn better."
23846,0,"There's studies that show 20% more people gain more knowledge when physically being in school. There's a ongoing debate over which is more beneficial, going to school or doing school courses online. To me, going to school is more beneficial because you get to ask questions if you are stuck and you get to socialize wit all your friends. There are those who say that attending class online is better, but this is not true. Those who tend to believe that is because they may prefer working alone or just like to cheat. Although some may disagree, Physically going to school is better because you get to ask to teacher for help on anything you need(in or out of school), It's a way to get out the house for a good 6 hours, if students don't eat at home then the school will provide them with food to increase brain flow, and you won't have to be socially isolated. There are a variety of reasons why physically going to school is better. Teachers will assist you with anything you need help or advice with. If you're confused on school work then they will help you the best way they can. Or even at home if something is going on at home you're scared to talk to your parents about, then they may be a substitution for your parents. Also, it's a time consumer being in school for 6 hours. It helps students be doing something constructive instead of sitting in the house all day. It gives your parents time to do their daily duties. Furthermore, If students don't eat at home, the school will provide them with the food and nutrients they need. When students eat food it increase brain flow and help student think better. A reason for students not eating at home is their family may be poor. Another reason attending school physically is better are the friends/associates unlike being trapped in the house being socially isolated. You are able to work with friends during a class assignment if teacher allows it. If so working with friends could get the job done quicker. In addition, you're having fun while doing it. During group activities, it's a possibility that at least 2 people will become new friends. This can happen by knowing about each other common interest. Learning about each other could make yall just the best of friends. Altogether, if you have good friends,they can help you better yourself. They help you better yourself by keeping you on the right path. They also help during emotional stress when you're at the lowest point in life. Although some may disagree, Actually going in the school building is better due to the fact of your teacher helping you with all your needs, It lets your parents get the free time they need to do what they have to do, and the school is gonna feed you while you socialize with friends. Teachers,friends, and school food can make a person be more beneficial to themselves in life, not just in school. There are those who believe that attending school electronically is better because of them making their own schedule, being able to stay home and it's easy to cheat but this is not true due to the fact of you're not really learning anything if you can't ask a question when you have a problem, and you may just wanna give up or be distracted by something better than work. Moral of the story, Don't be lazy trying to stay home, go to school, socialize with people, and have fun, your life is still young. Don't waste it being socially isolated."

The formation does not completely resemble a face; there are many flaws. NASA would tell the public if they had any solid evidence that suggests it was built by aliens. Rock formations like the face are common in that area of mars and it is very possible that they could look like a face. There are a lot of rock formations on Mars. Out of all those formations, one of them is probably going to resemble a face. The rock formation doesn't resemble a face perfectly. There are flaws that suggests it is just a natural formation. If it was an alien built formation, there would be a lot less flaws. They wouldn't waste all that time making it and leave so many flaws. NASA would definetely tell the public if there was any sign that an alien civilazation built it. NASA would have to tell us that they discovered a civilazation. They get their money from us. NASA would get a lot of funding to explore the face if there was any sign of any civilazation and that is what NASA is all about, exploring. The face is just a natural formation. No aliens built the face. There are many of these types of rock formations in that area. The formation has a lot of flaws that don't resemble a face. NASA would tell the public if it was built by aliens."
