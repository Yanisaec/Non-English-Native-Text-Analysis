4607,0,"Technology is evolving and its evolving fast, for the fact that now we have a computer that may read students faces to determine if they lost interest and than alter the thing they are looking at. We will be talking about what this technology could leade to, what it may mean for schools, and how positive it may be. Now this technology is quite advanced but, could it be a little far? Personally i feel this technology could be something positive in our lives but it could leade to many bad things. People will start relying on their computer to make them happy, people who have loved ones may just use a computer to read their emotions rather than actually trying to figure it out. Schools are always trying to keep students happy, or willing to learn. But they seem to always lose their interest, so maybe it will help classes and maybe help advance students to a better grade or maybe even get them somewhere were they feel intrigued in. It could also help for the fact of students who are angry, helping them relax or putting them in a different situation. This technology is very positive but still has its down sides. In my eyes, I see this as something negative for the fact being that humans need to try and reach someones heart and know them. We cant have technology just tell you if someone is happy or if they upset. You wouldnt really get any experience in social skills. So to end this off, i do not agree of having this. This technology will end social skills and hurt schools for the fact of no one would be used to one another. Social skills is one skill everyone needs to have, learn, and use on a day to day bases."
17626,0,"NASA. The United States form of a dominating space academy. The Viking 1, was in fact NASA's spacecraft that was launched in 2001. The spacecraft was set course for the small, red planet that is simillar to Earth. The planet is called Mars. Viking 1's ""sister"" Viking 2 was supposed to be landing on Mars, and that's why Viking 1 was sent up in space to begin with. While Viking 1 was snapping photos, its camera picked up a weird face-like structure on the surface of Mars. Some believe its a mysterious face that ""so called aliens"" built. I believe that their reasoning is just a bunch of garbage. What I think that is, is just a simple and natural landform made by the underground volcanoes, sandy surface, and rocks that landed there. One reason I believe that this is a natural landform is from looking at the photos. The ""face"" isn't any perticular shape that any man or alien would want. The landform would be shaped as a circle, square or any other simple shape, and it would not be so ridgid and cracked. If you were to look at the photo furthest to the left, you would assume that it resembled a face, but If you compair that photo to the one taken twenty-five years later, you would begin to understand that to photo was out-dated and that the camera was not as clear as the one taken later. In addition, why would an alien make a structure of a human's face. That part of the theory makes more sense if you take into consideration the angle the camera could have been taken at. Notice photo two? Its seems to be taken at an angle where there looks like there is a small mountain range looming over the rest of the area. This is key evidence explaining how this is just a natural landmark on Mars. If you still do not believe me, then this next part will. If you think about it, why would NASA keep an amazing discover like this a secret? The answer is that they would not. If NASA went worldwide with their ""face"" they would make more money than millionaires or even other space academies. It does not make sense that the academy would keep an alien encounter hidden. In conclusion, NASA is either brave or very stupid not to tell people about their ""face"", or people just want to get their word out to make other people critisized, make other people feel stupid, or they just want to feel like they are correct when they are clearly not. Therefore; This ""so called face"" is not a face, but it is just a land mark that was naturally constructed by the elements and not alien life-forms."

Venus conditions also beat submarines divinging into the deepest parts of out oceans. Ir would liquidfy metals. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar sysem even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Venusian geology and weather presents additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface. Venus was probaly covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Venus still has some features just like Earth. The planet has rocky sediment and includes familar features like valleys mountains and craters but, you have to consider given the long time frames of space travel. Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray. A cehicle hpvering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of the way. You would have to be 30 plus miles above the surface. The temperture will still be hot around 170 degrees. The air pressure would be close to sea level on Earth.

As said in this article that it can read human emotion but not for any purpose except changing a lesson to your understanding when you're confused, but other than that there aren't much use for it. In paragraph of the atricle it states, "" you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" This statement from the article basically shows that some people already know how to read human emotion ny just looking, so this technology may only be valuable to people who can't read human emotions as good as others. In the article, it even says ""most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"" and also says "" so computers need to understand that,too."" In any form of communication, a human understands nonverbal and emotional communication which makes it easier for humans to understand that on another human than technology could."
4798,0,Is the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students faces in a classroom valuable. I dont think a computer can read what you are feeling thats my oppinion because i can tell what you are feeling without a computer you dont need a computer to know what your friend or your self is feeling because if you look into a computer do you think it could really tell you what you are thinking because all you can see is your reflexion in the black computer screen. there is no evidence in the passage that tells me what i need to know because there is no way a computer can tell you how you are feeling thats why you have your self or others. is the use of this tschnology to read the emotional expressions of students in a class room valuable. No because you dont need a computer to tell you how you feel or to tell you how you look.

In Bogota in stead of banning the cars everyday they what is called a ""Car-free day"" in this car free day people either hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work or school. Violators faced $25 fines. In Paris they enforced a partial diving ban to clear air of the global city. If people dint leave their cars at home they suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). Almost 4,000 drivers were fined. When the smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party they only banned odd-numbered plates on Tuesday. In German you are not allowed to drive a car but you are allowed to own one and if you do own one you must pay $40,000 to have it parked at your home. "" Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in eroupe, the untied states and elsewhere to seperate suburban life from auto use.."" The untied states needs to do something about the auto use. We should use the new trend to try and not use cars anymore or do what Bogota does and have car-free days. This new trend wou;d help our contries and states. It was help the air not be as polluted as it is now. We dont want the air to get as bad a china or any other counties because then we really wont have a choice of a car-free day. People today should take the oppertunity and walk place that are close to home instead of driving places close to home and putting that extra pollution in the air. Obama is rethinking about this trend because accordng the text 23% of young people driving has decreased witch mean either less people are going to be driving because they dont have a licenece or the young people will start to drive without a licence and not care. Countries have open new programs where they get kids to go bike riding aound the block or country or to go hiking or just anything to save from driving everywhere. these programs are across the nation.

11883,0,"The Face showing on Mars has been proved to be a natural landform. The Face is a landform because landforms are very common in Cydonia, the only reason the landform looked like a face was because of the shadows visible from the camera, and there was no other evidence found around the face. Also all research for the Face was done by authorized NASA scientists, and the research was believed to be done very carefully. In Cydonia it is common to have natural landforms, so the Face was easy to be spotted as one. And as the cameras took pictures from different angles, the scientists could see it wasn't anything that spectacular. What made the Face so intresting and made people have false accusations was what made the Face an actual ""face"". The reason that this lanform resembled a face was because of the shadows. There was shadows on the landform that resembled a head, eyes, a nose, and a mouth. Scientists even stated that the Face ""looked like an Egyptian Pharoah"". Even if the Face was found to look like something that was a living thing does not have an effect on the research that had been completed on this landform. To make this statement that the Face is in fact a landform is the amounts of research done by NASA scientists. From snapping numerous pictures to keep resuming to study the Face, NASA has had many ways to prove their point. And after placing the first image on a JPL website, it was settled for most people- the once known as ""Face"" was a natural landform. It was no sign of Aliens or an Alien monument anywhere to be seen on Mars. And the last statement to be concluded about this discussion is that there was nothing else found near the Face to thinking there is any living activity on Mars. NASA has also concluded from the pictures that there had been no objects in the picture like ""airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks..."" So there had been no activity to prove to be nothing more from just a landform. In the picture of the Face, it was also evidenced to resemble a mesa or a butte, another kind of natural landform. These kinds of natural landforms were even almost the same height as the Face on Mars. And all of this evidence proved that what used to be thought of as a real face is now catagorized as a natural landform with some shadows that gives it unique look."
14230,0,"Viking 1 photo was taken in 1976 and had people believing all sorts of things. It apperred to be a human face, but was not yet proven to be one. Some belived that is was just a natural landform, but which one is it? This mask on Mars was soon unmasked on May 24, 2001, and is proven to be a natural landform. They have used better pictures and comparison from Earth. Using pictures to discorver the ""Face on Mars"" was difficult in 1976 because we did not have high tech cameras to prove anything, but as the years gone by we could soon tell the truth. For example, 22 years later Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) was able to take a picture of the figure ten times sharper. After this picture was taken, more people were able to believe that this mask on Mars was just natural landform. Then 3 years later in 2001 we had taken another picture that was even closer and it diffinetly showed landform. Yes, the ""Face on Mars"" was discorvered to be a mesa, or landforms common around the American West. With all these pictures from 1976 to 2001, we had compared them to these Earth landforms. For example, Garvin says that it reminds him of most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, which is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. This mysterious figure on Mars had turned out to be just natural landform called a mesa. The evidence and details have proven that through pictures and comparison. There is no longer a need to believe any alien monument or life on Mars. Sure, the viking 1 photo gave an illusion, but the MGS image from 2001 gives more evidence to what it really is. Thanks to Malin's teams, that caputured an extraodinary photo to prove the truth."
16883,0,"There are many things that the world can benefit from by having driverless and smart cars. Deaths caused by car accidents, reckless, and drunk drivers would not be as high as they are now if we had driverless and smart cars. The amount of gas usage would not be as high as it is, becuase most people would not even need it. People would not have the stress of worrying about crashing into others cars or things. A car being a smart car, knowing when things are getting dangerous, and knowing not to crash into things would be also very beneficial for beginners and drivers who are paranoid about driving. Driverless and smart cars could really change the way the world works when it comes to cars. I think driverless cars would be safer for the world. When people die by car it is usually because of the reckless and drunk drivers behind the wheel. Now sometimes you can not control the way a person drives and also acccidents happen. With smart and driverless cars you have less things to worry about when it comes to things like accidents. I feel as if driverless cars would really help contribute to the stopping of all the unnecessary deaths cause by reckless and drunk drivers. In 2013 BMW developed a car that was called a "" Traffic Jam Assistant "". That car could handle functions at speeds up to 25 mph. It could accelerate, steer, and brake for itself. Even though the car did all of those things, it still notified the person behing the wheel when they needed to pay attention to the road ahead. I feel as if a car that is able to do that is wonderful and very beneficial to drivers and pedestrians. Being that people have already started developing these types of cars, I think that they should go on with making them better and safer for the world to have. Driverless and smart cars are things that just shows how well we have advanced with technology. Driverless and smart cars should continue to be developed and made even better in differnt ways. Why not take advantage of new techonology, and use it in a good way. Driverless and smart cars are bound to be great in years to come."
11159,1,"The passage says, ""NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face."" At first scientist figured it was just another ""Martian mesa"", common around Cydonia, but they said it had unusual shodows that made it look like an ""Egyptian Pharaoh"". The ""Face on Mars"" is a natural landform because it could be a crater with shadows that makes it look like a human face or it could also be a rock with dents that causes it to have shadows and makes it look like a human face. The passage also says, ""A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" So it is a nautral landform not an artifact created by aliens. People might stil think that the ""Face on Mars"" was created by aliens but the passage says, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West."" It actually is a natural landform."
12642,0,"In this article, the author talks abut driverless car and the benfits and problems with them. The author says his veiw and the veiw others may have on the driverless car. I am going to point out some of the aadvantages and disadvantages of owning a driverless car. The benfits of a driverless car is that you dont have to drive as much only on certain things I mean thats obvious. You can text or call when driving and not have to worry about wrecking because your car by the hit of a button will drive for you, then when your done texting you hit the button and now your in contorl of the car. This is also a good advantage for people who cant see very well but still well enough to drive but it really strains their eyes. You might be thinking okay those are ther advantages so what are the disadvantages well I'll tell you. A disavantage of a driverless car is that they cant do everything there is still things the operator has to do like back out of driveways or pull out of driveways or drive in traffic. Also the car could mess up go haywire or something and cause a wreck, and that wouldnt look good on the business. While a driverless car isn't fully a bad idea and is worth a shot at trying, some dont agree and some states even banded it, they wont even test a driverless car. You see that there are alot of good advantages and some disadvantages but sometimes you just have to try take the risk and see what happens. My opinion on driverless car is that they are good idea but i think they still need alot of work to fix bugs and work out all the ckinks in them. Overall, I believe driverless cars are not a bad thing once properly fixed and everything is near perfect, and they work out the ckinks they are worth a try. Its going to take them awhile to fix everything on a driverless car before they are ever sold, if they are ever sold. it could take 10 to 20 years before they are ever on the market. But when they do start to sale people should definetly give them a try."
8467,0,"I believe that the use of the tecnology emotional expression of the students in a classroom would be valuable because the instructor would be able to connect with the student, so the student who are confused or stuck may recieve the right amount of help they'll need to understand and comprehend the lesson. The techonolgy of emotional expressions could show if a student is frustrated, happy, confused and ect. Then after the technology recieves the data the instructor can know mostly likely will need help. So, those student could recieve the right amount of help they'll need to understand the lesson or topic on hand. According to the text it states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr.Huang predicts. 'Then it could moify the lesson, like and effective human instructor."" The textual evidence I provided show that the computer tecnology emotional expression could help the instructor modify or change the lesson to make it easier for more people to learn, and fr the teacher to connect with the students. After all I believe that the technology emotional expression can be a valuable thin for the students and instructor in the classroom."
12757,0,"The face on mars isn't created by aliens. The face is not created by aliens because its shaped as an human face, which in the passage says that the face resembled a human head,eyes, nose and a mouth. Aliens dont look like humans so how would they create something that is most likely similar to a human? Then again it might not be created by humans either.Its created by land and her are some possiblitys why or is the face created by the land of mars! It can be created by land. [ example: rocks are shaped like things sometimes and so are chips]. So the land on mars could of had movement and let to the wind making a face on their land instead of humans or aliens making the human face on mars landform. On mars the face eyes could of been space rocks landed and made holes that look like rocks. Or it could be space bubble have busted on them.It could have been asteroids that have fell and made holes on the so called face on mars. On the land of mars it could have jus been rocks that where shaped like things for no reason. If there is water on mars the land could of produced the water the wrong way on the land. That let to bumps, lumps and humps that made a human face. Also the land of mars could already be bumpy or have rocks that look like a human face because of the wind pushed to hard on the ground and make dents like eyes, nose and a mouth. [example; When you spray water on dirt it makes dents and it also pushed the dirt away to somewhere eles.] Another example is when wind pushes on alot of dirt or sand it makes dents and they might look as if it was a face. On the land it could be when the electronic waves hit land of mars it could create waves. Leading the waves into make creations into the land on mars. Sometimes land are in funny shapes. The rumors in the stores might be as if they are scared that land can create things such as humans face and its face particles, such as the face on mars. Also maybe its parts of mars that have sunk in and lead the sunk in part to look as a human face and the parts that humans have on thier face such as eyes, nose and a mouth. Or space crafts could have landed and the part that helded the ship down the land might have of sunk in that in. Then the next time they came back to explore more it had the chracteristics as a human."

Having facial action coding could help to allow a teacher to see when a student may be bored or is confused and simply needs some help. Prof. Thomas huang of the beckman institute, and also prof. Nicu Sebe of the university of amesterdam have been working together to create and improve facial action coding for it would be extremely valuable for our classrooms.

In addition because of the facial actions coding capabilities to detect these emotions it could also modify a lesson to be more fit for any certain student;""Then it could modify the lesson, Like an effective human instructor"". Evidently having facial action coding software in classrooms would be an extremely valuable thing, And although the opposing side may say that children should'nt have their emotions read that it's their personal buisness, it turns out most communication happens to be nonverbal anyways:""most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" facial action coding system is an abosolute leap in technology advancements, for its ability to detect and analyze facial musclar movements. It would be extremely valuable for our modern day classrooms. Contrary to a common belief that it is wrong to read the emotions or expressions of younger kids just to make sure they are going to be paying attention in class it turns out we already do that as humans:"" in fact we humans perform this same impressive 'calculation' everyday. for instance, you can probably tell how. friend is feeling simply by the the look on her face"". Evidently if we are already doing this naturally as humans furthermore it would'nt develoup conflict. Overall having facial action coding in our modern day classrooms would be very valuable and they would be beneficial for their capabilities to detect what a student is paying attention to the teacer or lesson in class, and also be able to modify class lesson to better them for the students, and finally for their ability to analyze the facial muscular movement."
10077,0,"In my opinion, I like the driverless cars in many ways. They are easy to drive and can protect the environment. If there are all driverless cars in a state, it can have a good traffic and less traffic accidents. Nowadays, traffic accidents are very normal. More and more people died of traffic accidents and it is hard to avoid the accidents because of so many cars. Using driverless cars is a good way to avoid accidents through the computer controling the cars. In other side, we can't aviod all the accidents. When there is an accident, the computer cannot fix that very well, so it is time that drivers drive the cars. Some drives need to drive a long-distance trip. They will feel very tired. When the computers control the cars, it is good time for the drivers to have a rest. Drivers can enjoy the display boards on the cars. Last but not least, driverless cars can protect our environment. Nowadays the environment is getting worse and worse. The biggest problem is the car pollutions. If cars can use half of the fuel than normal, the enviroment will become much better. In conclusion, driverless car is a way to help our lives better. So I agree the development of these cars."
11611,0,"Driverless cars have been imagined for a while. The cars have been in the works for years but Google has claimed the tittle for the first to make the amlighty driverless car. The cofounder of Google envisons a future of public transportation where it is driverless. In the end the decision to go forward and have all cars be driverless is a great idea. Accoring to the article in 2009 a driverless car was tested out and drove more than half a million miles without a crash. Wolrdwide car accidents are a leading reason for dealth. This minumises this with the car tested in 2009. This could be a potental saver of many lives being lost in car accidents. With the creation of the car people on the street would also have a way better navagation system. In the late 1950's a General Motors track and car was made baised off a specific concept car that would run on a special test track. The track was baised off an electical cable and also another driverless car at Bekeley where they used magnets with alternating polarity. The desire to have a driverless car has been trying to be engeneered for years. Even in the 1950's these smart road system worked quite well, though there would be massive changes needing to be updated onto our current roads which is way to expensive to be practicle, it can be tweaked and made better for safer driving. One of the biggest issues with the driverless cars is the actual human drivers involvement in the driverless cars. The human driver is infact required to do some driving if there is road work or accidents; this makes a lot of people upset questioning if the cars are even infact driverless. Along with that comes of who claimes the responsibiliy if an accident accurs? Traffic laws are writtin with the assumption that a human driver is in control of the car at all times. It is even illegal in most states to even test drive computerdriven cars. Which brings in the big question of if technology fails and someone is injured, who is resposnible for the accident - the manufacturor or the driver? With the cars having someone to navigate through trafic or areas where there is an accident thats just to ensure a safer experience. The computer can ideed direct the car to steer, accelerate, and brake itsself. Alert drivers area neeeded as for the car has been designed to get the drivers attention whenever a problem accurs or it is nessasary for them to take over. They have even developed vibrating seatbelts. Driverless cars would be quite usefull and should be developed and manufactured worldwide. This car minnumises accidents and could save a lot of lifes. The driverless cars are continueng to be developed and Telsa has even projected a car in 2016 capable of driving on autioptolet 90 percent od the time. This car would change the future making it a safer place for drivers everywhere."

23121,0,"Politicts have been around for centuries; politics were made to keep the peace and give everyone a fair expresion to the people. We have all herd of people in political standpoint have been corrupt, but what if our own voting system was corrupt and our votes have never made a diffrence in selecting a president by the people. When we vote for our selected president is it really going to change or make a diffence on who gets elected... right? ""of course it will make a diffrence."" As long as your states electors dont choice by who they feel is the best fit for presidency. On another note what about the Electoral college votes. Why does one canidate always get all the electoral college votes from one state? Why cant we just revert to how many votes the canidate gets? When getting down to the nitty-gritty bits of the Electoral College voting system it is a bit unfair in the ways it works in a whole, but that doesnt mean we have to abolish it and start over. The Electoral College voting system has worked for many years. In stead of just getting rid of the Electoral voting system maybe we should tweek it in a bit that makes everyone happy and makes it completly fair. Each state picks how it gives its Electoral votes, but in most states its a ""winner takes all."" When a state desides its going to be a ""winner takes all"" state, that means when voting all the Electoral votes will go to the canidate with the most amount of elector votes. Instead of using the winner takes all system each electoral votes should be given fairly. When electors votes for its canidates by the people that single Electoral vote should go to that canidate. When doing this people are in-tern voting for there canidate. Now that they Electoral votes are being distubuted evenly there is a smaller problem we face. Electors are the people who actully vote for our presidential canidate. Very rarely do these electors not choose the canidate based on the amount of votes they have been given, but it does happen. The electors are in a way chosen randomly but most of the time are chosen by the presidential canidate. Often these canidates do the right thing and vote based on votes gifen to him by the public. When these electors vote they are not well regulated. What we should do is have a sort of security system that alows us the make sure our electors do the right thing. instead on relying on someones trust worthyness we should have a system that counts the publics votes. When the elector is done with his final vote we would then see if he voted based on public votes. We the people are faces with another way of voting. We can vote for whatever canidate we please and when done with we will see how many people voted for each canidate, and whoever has the most wins right? This system would most likely give one the canidates an unfait advantage. When Romney and Obama went head to head in 2012 obama won because the amount of Electoral votes, but if we did it by the number of votes it would have been almost completly tied in votes. since Romeny was born in the south most likely each state in the south would vote for Romney. Since Obama was born in Hawiia there is no state near Hawiia that would have the same oppinion. So when using just plain votes one canidate would most likely have an unfair advantage based on the size and populating of each state going for that presidential canidate. When suming it all up the Electoral College voting system is in a way a bit unfair, but when using the method given each Electoral vote would be given fairly instead of a winner takes all system. When going for just plain voting it would most likely turn out unfair or a lot of tied runnings. When given the facts the Electoral College is fine as it is but can be unfair and that is why we should use this method in the next following elections."
16869,0,"My position on driverless cars is i think that this is a good idea. I yhink this is a great idea, and could help a lot. It could help a lot with mothers on the go with a lot of kids, the simple fact of a major improvments on cars for the future, and people that like to text and drive or put on make up while driving. The driverless car concept could help a lot in the future. It would help those mothers that need to turn around or reach back to give there child something while she is driving. It would help because she could just put it into driverless mode and do what she needed to do. It would be a major help for those people that happen to text and drive, or put on make up while driving. The driver could then put the car into driverless mode, and send that last text or finish their make up before work, and prevent them from crashing. The overall concept of driverless cars is a big acomplishment and could bring us closer to bigger, and better things for cars in the future. The concept of driverless cars is far from being a every day thing, like it says in paragraph 10. Once driverless cars are finished, and everyone will use them it will be a whole new thing for driving on the road."
4034,0,"Venus is the second planet from our sun. The article ""the Challenge of Exploring Views"" explains how NASA has been studying how to send humans to Venus. Venus is the hottest planet and has conditions that ""humans do not encounter on Earth."" The author supports his idea, that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers, by stating facts about Venus, study from NASA, and innovation. The facts that the author included in his article is the first reason Venus is worth studying. Venus is Earth's ""twin"". A long time ago, Venus was covered with large oceans, land, and could have supported life like Earth. Venus has a surface of rocky sediment and also includes valleys, mountains, and craters. Temperate also plays a big role in studying Venus. Venus has the hottest surface out of our whole solar system. Venus' atmosphere is almost at 97 percent. On an average, temperates go over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The study from NASA is the second reason Venus is worth studying. NASA is trying to find electronics that will be able to last while being on Venus. The researchers at NASA have started to look back at the old technology. Modern technology will melt in Venus with the hot temperates. NASA is also studying the solutions to the conditions of Venus. NASA wants to, eventually, make Venus survivable for humans. They are imagining aiplanes, cars, and solar power in the future for Venus. The innovation is the final reason Venus is worth studying. Researchers believe that travel to Venus should not be limited by ""dangers and doubts"". They believe that the astronauts should want to expand their knowledge on Venus. Researchers also want astonaunts to use their imagination. They want them to strive to meet the challenge instead of running away from it. Human curiosity should lead us to many ""intimidating endeavors"", or things that we fear. After looking at facts, study, and innovation, it is clear that studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers. Venus creates much fear for astronaunts with the hot temperate and thought that they might not make it back home, but they shouldn't limit themselves to their own fear."

Really though they were able to get better pictures from better cameras, showing it was just a rock with weird shaped shaows making it look like a rock. Looking at the new highly detailed pictures they recived they classified the land formation to just be another Martian mesa that are common through that area. You now know this but now you just have to think do you believe me, or will you keep thining it's an alien artifact. Saying all this I'm not trying to tell you theres no such thing as aliens, just this formation is natural. Trust me there are a lot more things happening around us than you think."

In the text it says, ""To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together."" What a neat way to serve for others! I would really like to have the joy of doing that. The Seagoing Cowboys also supply you with the chance to see the world. It states that, "" 'Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China.' "" Luke also got to see and tour other places he had never seen before. Some where Greece, Italy and the Panama Canal. The Cowboys offer one other great thing that is the most important thing for every one to have, fun. They also have great games for exersize. When they were done with the shipping and going back home for more stuff it says in the story that, ""The cowboys played baseball and vollyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed."" Doesn't that sound like fun? They also did other activities like whittling and reading in their spare time. Now that you have seen and read all about the great things the Seagoing Cowboys do I hope that one day you will join them. They sound like a neat opportunity to serve, have fun, and to see the world around us. I know that if I had the chance that I would sign up to help. Would you?"
19391,0,"My argument is against the development of these cars. The arguement is that these cars can be dangerous in many different ways. Who would actually want a car that drives for itself? That's kind of weird and creepy at the same time. If google were to actually make this car would they be responsible for any of the crashes that involve these cars? To being my arguement, I would like to say that a driveless car would be the death of many people. For instance the author say's that there will be motion sensors that will tell the car when your hands aren't on the wheel. What happens if those sensors aren't working, that would be the cause of a huge accident. A driveless car would be a cool invention but it's also a life risking invention to. In the article the author says "" In most states it is illegal even to test computer driven cars"" that should be one reason to consider not making this car. With this car being invented it would be alot of cautions to consider while driving it. The driver of the car must keep their eyes on the road at all times even if the cart is driving it's self at the moment. The dangers of this car are very serious. What if a young mom and her children are heading home from a football game one night, an their driving a driveless car. All of a sudden the cars steering wheel locks up and mom can't take control of the car causing the car to crash into a tree. This is one reason I say this car shouln't be invented, it would cause lots of peoples deaths. I'm not saying that it's not a genius idea but it's also something you might want to reconsider buliding. This whole driveless car idea is super sweet but there are also young people out there, who go to parties and get super drunk then get behind the wheel. You have to think about all the negative things that could happen with the invention of this car not just the positive. To conclude my passage I want to say, that if this car ever does get invented it should be a certain age limit on them. By saying this I mean it should be directed to certainage group. Also the manufactures should make sure that everything in the car is working correctly before selling the car. It would be smart and it would save everyone the worries of losing a loved one to a car thats's driven by a computer."

I put this quote, beacuse i think is says a lot about human emotion, we all have different was of showing how we feel indiviually and with this technoloy it can hep with understanding each other. Understanding how teenager feels is hard even for parents,so how can teachers how students feel. A lot of us teenagers sometimes lie about how we feel or if we understand your lesson plan, but with Facial action Coding System teachers can see how we feel about all of theses new things were learning. This is an effective way teachers can see if we feel sad and bored. Even with a fake smile teacers can see if your telling the truth. Yes, every student isnt the same, but I think having this technoloy thats how can understand what each studnets need to help out every student. "" A classroom computer coukd reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored"", I put this here because this is a statement. This is something humans lack in, understand human emotions. FACS can really help people consulers, teachers, and nurses.

18479,0,"I think the idea to create driverless cars in not a good one at all. Not only is it extremely dangerous, but they are also going to be very expensive if they do eventually start being sold to people. No one is going to have enough money for them. However, they are very dangerous. If they are run by computers, then who knows when they could breakdown or malfunction on the road? Computers die and malfunction all the time. So these cars could do the exact same thing. I know I sure wouldn't want to be driven around by a ""robot"" that has my life in it's hands. Pretty scary if you think about it. Also, no one knows whether these cars could last a decent amount of time. They could give out and die at any time and be unfixable. Granted they could probably be fixed pretty easily depending on what the problem might be, but they could still potentially give out on the road and even kill someone or many people. Another thing that doesn't seem to have been thought out thoroughly, is that the sensors could mistake a child with a trash bag or think a light pole is just a shadow. If one of these cars were to mistake a child for something completely different, who knows what it would do, or if it would even stop. If this car was to ever mistake a flag pole with a shadow, or not even know there that there's a pole there, it could crash and kill the people inside. One final problem that could accure, is the facts that these cars could explode or catch on fire in certain climates or certains tempratures. It may sound unusual, but it is very possible. If the wires are set up or connected wrong, then in certain situations the car could be done for in the blink of and eye. There's also the possibility that if certain areas of the car were to get wet or dirty, then the car could also short out or catch on fire in the same way. In conclusion, although they sound pretty useful and it would be amazing if everyone had one, in my mind too many things could go wrong. They could give out on the road and kill someone. They could mistake a child for something completely different or not sense the child at all. They could catch on fire in certain climates, or they could malfunction if certain parts of the car were to get wet or dirty. There are just too many negative things that could happen."
7772,0,"The use of technology to read human emotions is incredibly valuable, Though it doesn't seem like it would be if the idea was just handed to you with no explanation or substance behind it, putting some thought behind it really does get you thinking of where exactly this techonlogy can go and be used for. Think just about exactly how many possibilities this could have. In the future, it could be used to help treat people with emotional or psychological problems, be used in test studies to find out how something (an ad, a book, a phrase) makes someone feel. Putting some more thought into it, it could even potentially be helpful in a legal case to know if someone is lying or witholding information just from their facial expression. The focus of this essay, however, puts the focus on how this could be used to help students get better focused in the classroom. Classrooms, as of recently, have been widely criticised as one thing: boring. We've essentially been learning the same way for about 300 years at this point, learning the same way as some of our great great great great grandparents did in colonial times. Though the introduction of more technology into the classroom has helped keep it fresh, the wide consensus is that we don't use the technology that's been given to us enough to make a difference. And, even at that, it doesn't help the fact that students today don't actually learn much going through the American educational system other than how to memorize and spew out information in order to pass a test. There is a potential solution to this, however. With the new emotion reading technology being developed, Prof. Thomas Whang, from the University of Illinois' Beckman Institute for Advanced Science, stated that using this technology in the classroom could be beneficial; ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Wouldn't it be helpful if there were some way to know if you aren't getting a student's interest in something so that you could teach them more effectively? Or to know beforehand that someone was getting angry, or that something was wrong with how the student was interpreting things? This is precisely why this technology should be used. Though the whole thing would seem more or less like a giant case study on the American student's emotions, it would be beneficial not only educationally to the students and teachers that way, but it could also possibly benefit students psychologically, too, which could potentially allieviate some of the emotional stress a lot of students have to deal with on a regular basis. Possibly the only downside about all of this is that the computers that most schools can afford can't run the software to make all of this possible. Maybe if Bill Gates and that foundation of his can shell out some more money to lower income schools to get the stuff running, helped by the american government if they ever get on board with this, this could potentially be one of the best things that could be done for the American educational system. Hopefully, with some time for technology to advance, this beneficial tech could be used in every classroom."
511,0,"I agree with the author, like he says studying Venus is whorthy the dangers it presents. I also agree with him, because in the paragraph says that Venus is one of the brightes points of light in the night sky that means that they are really fascinated to study Venus. The challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. So the travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of immagination and innovation. According to the article Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. Sometimes because of the changes of speed in the orbit we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus. Because of the change of speed previous missons were unmanned, this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Some of the qualities of Venus is that is really amazing Venus as a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets. The more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venu's atmosphere. The planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmosphereric pressure is 90 times greater that what we wxperience on our planet. So that means that these conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth. Also Venus has the hottest suface temperature of any planet in our solar system. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. According to the NASA, it has one particulary compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possicle solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. In conclusion, scientist should go to Venus and keep studying it. Researches are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus. Also Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions. The challenge presented by Venus has value, so that's why studying Venus is worth the dangers it presents."

That's when the problems come although they have some positive outcomes. First, Sensors and computer hardware and software show improvements to make driving safer. Also lets driveless cars handle more driving tasks on their own. In the text it states that "" the combination of all this input is necessary for the driveless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel."" For example, in Google's modified Toyota has sensors in the left rear wheel, rotating sensor on the roof, video camera mounted near the rearview miror and other things. Second, when it comes to operating driveless cars, who is really driving? They're special touch sensors that make sure that the driver keeps hold of the wheel. Driveless cars can accelerate, steer and brake themselves but its designed to notify the driver when it requires human skills in the road. For example, around accidents and work zones that means that the driver must remain alert and be ready to take over the wheel. Finally, most driving laws focus on kiping drivers, passengers and pedestrians safe.The text also states that ""lawmakers know that safety is the best achieved with alert drivers."" Although if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in case of an accident but if the technology fails. Who's fault is it the driveless car or the driver? The author illustrates positive and negative facts about driveless cars. They might be safe and an opportunity to prove technoly is improving.

5439,0,"Technology is becoming a bigger part of our lives. As time goes on, we develop new technology for different purposes. One such purpose is to read emotions. This technology will benefit our society in different ways, like in education. The technology to read students emotions is valuable to our schools. The first way in which this technology is vaulable to schools is by improving lessons. Often times, many students of different calibers are thrust into the same classroom. While some grow bored others become confused by the content of the lesson. In the article, Dr. Huang is quoted saying, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" and then ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. If we implemented this emotion recognition technology, we could help students of all levels grow and reach their potential. Another reason why technology that can recognize emotions is vaulable in schools is because of fighting and bullying. In paragraphs three and four of the article, it discusses how the technology works and what it can do. It claims that it can dectect mixed emotions and even, in paragraph 8, detect fake smiling. This technology could be used to detect when students are angry and wanting to fight or even sad from being bullied. Teachers cannot always detect these things from students, especially if they are trying to hide them. In addition to stopping fights and helping bullied students, this emotion recognition technology could assist in identifying students who have problematic home lives and need help. Although this would not always be 100% accurate, it could help faculty see those students who might be depressed or angry, and need help. This would aid in making schools a happier place. It could also negate problems that they could have later in life. Installing this technology in our schools would be highly beneficial. Schools need the technology to read students emotions. It would fit in with other technological advancements that have improved our education system. Advances in technology helped to improve not just our education, but our overall lives. Numerous people in our world cannot live without technology. Technology is important to our society."

18649,0,"Today I was having an agument with my buddy. This argument was about ""The Face on Mars"". We both had our own opinions on what we thought it was. We weere sitting in my living room on the tan couch with the television on. My friend was tall with blonde hair and skinny. I had brown hair and was average height. I worked for Nasa so I had seen pictures of what it was and had proof that it was only a mesa and it was an illusion to the human eye. Zeke thought it was an artifact on once living life on Mars. He thought Nasa was going to say it was something else so people wouldn't truly know what it was. He thought Nasa was trying to keep it in the dark so noone would try and travel there to get closer looks on it and steal there idea. Zeke thought we needed to run further studies to truely figure out what this was. I told Zeke that it was only a landform on Mars and not some alien artifact. I told him that it was a mesa which was common in this area of Mars. I also explained how shadows made it look like a face and how it was all an illusion that was visible to the human eye. They said that this landform was nothing more than a landorm on Mars that wasnt what it had appered to be. Zeke, who was a man of what he said, did not believe me and wouldn't take my word for it. Once he got an idea in his head it wasn't going to move for anything. It did not matter what proof you showed him he wouldn't believe as single word. He argued with me about if or hours until finally we decided that we wouldn't argue about it anymore. He still told me he thought his idea was right and I was completly wrong. I told Zeke i worked for Nasa so I would know way more than he does an I insured him it was not an alien artifact and it was just a mesa which looked to be something it wasn't and that he shouldn't be so stubborn about it and just believe me. Knowing Zeke I didn't thnk he would even budge. Of course i was right and Zeke didn't sway his answer at all. I offered to show him prove. I had pictures of the event and so I showed him. He finally could see what we saw. He decided that he needed to look closer into the pictures. He came back the next morining and we sat down and ate donuts and drank some coffe. He gave me back the pictures and he said ""You know I think those pictures didn't help change my mind at all"""
16453,0,"Driverless cars are going to be amazing when they are released to the public. They are very intelligent machines that can make better or faster decisions than humans can on the road. Even though they are just testing them now, they still haven't caused any accidents. Think about it, everyone who drives a driverless car will have the option to steer, so it's their choice whether their life is at risk. Driverless cars haven't caused car-on-car accidents. The text states that driverless cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash. There have been a few cases where the driverless cars were involved in accidents, but that was because other people wrecked into them. They usually don't make road errors, but other people mess them up because of their bad driving habits. Drivers still have the option to take the wheel if they feel, or if the car feels, like something is wrong. The text states that driverless cars require some human skill so they would have to take the wheel at some point, but the rest of the driving is optional. The text also states that the driverless cars are also being programmed to warn the driver when they need to take control. The only drawback to this is that drivers will still have to be alert at all times incase the car needs their help. It may take some time before they are fully safe. The text states that there are some situations where humans would have to take control of the car like pulling out of driveways or moving around construction zones. This implies that the cars can't deal with humans very well. They can still manage to get in accidents with pedestrians if those people aren't dong what they are supposed to like J-walking. It will take awhile before driverless cars are upgraded with more reliable sensors that can detect pedestrians and even animals too. Driverless cars are going to be a huge innovation that changes the way everyone travels. Driverless cars are safe, fast decision makers, and help people get from place to place without driving the whole time. I wouldn't turn down a trip in something that has all of those great qualities. Driverless cars will truely be amazing when they are released."

This technology is very valuable for the classroom. The statment is true because as said in the article the computers will be able to read ther emotions and adaped them selfs to make it seem more intertaning. This technology would play a mager roll in learning. the text states in paragraph 6 that ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"","" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"",that help for students and teatchers would be amazing. Plus what would it hurt? its not a painless unnoticable process that helps the students get a better education. With this in our cumputers it can read the emotions of students better then the teacher ever could and can get the learns more focused and smarter. This technology will help out students more then ever and is to valuable to pass up and should be in every classroom posible"

I think how we should vote is by a majority vote where whoever wins the popular vote from all states will win the election and become are president. So whoever gets the most votes per every state that is who will win. One reason why i dont think we need to keep the electoral college is because in the second sorce in paragragh 14 where it says ""It's official:The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" It tells you that the electoral college makes it to where no matter who wins the popular vote the canidate will not win if the electoral college wants something different to happen. ""The Louisiaa legislature early succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.)"" i wanted to bring this up because if the Electoral Colege did what they were trying to do then Kennedy never would have been the president and who knows what the history of that presidency would be today. The electoral college is good at some times but i think that who ever wins th popular vote should automatically be the president. In the second sorce paragraph 2 it says ""What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college!"" According to Al Gore--thanks to the quirks of the electoral college--won the popular vote but did not win the presidency because of the electoral college. Over 60 percent of the people that vote for the president would rather have a direct election than have the electoral college becuse the electoral college does what they want and they do not listen to the people. I just think we need to no longer use the electoral college and just go by what the people of America think will be best for this country."
1463,0,"In ""The Challege of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. I think that he is right because earth is a small planet and we need to more space. The people of this planet are too much for it slowly we are killing the Mother Earth. over time people used almost all of it's resorces and sooner or later we will need to find another planet to live on. Yes it is close to the sun, and yes it is very hot. But we as pleople can do it. We put an man on the moon. This is just another step that we need to do. Venus is the Earth's twin, it is closest to its densiy and size. Venus and Mars orbit the sun at diffrent speeds sometimes Mars is close to us and sometimes Venus is. We have send numerous spacecrafts to land on this cloud-draped world. We studied Mars and Venus for years and we can send a spacecraft to get some sempals to see if we can survive on those planets. The Venus atmosphere is almost 97% CO2. The temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. It is way hotter the the Earth bacause it is so close to the sun and it gets way more sunlight then we do. The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greaater then what we experience on our own plate. I think that it is to much for us right now but in the future we will find a planet and we will live there. If we have the technology to explore our soloar system then we can find other living creatures in the galaxy and we can learn from them and to keep evolving."
6070,0,"Introducing this new technology that allows us to see when students are telling the truth on how they feel about an assignment would be very beneficial. With this technology we could see how students respond to certain types of activities and what they find interesting or boring. When a teacher ask a student feels about a particular lesson or assignment they might lie and say the enjoyed it or they found it interesting because that is what he or she thinks the teacher wants to hear. If this technology were introduced into classroom envrioments students would actually recieve education in a way they would find interesting and productive. Students can often become bored or loose focus in a classroom envrioment if what is being presented to them is not fun or interesting. With this new technology teachers can truly find out what their students enjoy the most. One of the leading creators, Dr. Huang states that ""'A clasroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored'"". With acess to these types of programs students wouldn't get bored or confused. The author of this article, Nick D'Alto states that ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"". If we can tell the facial expressions of a painting from hundreds of years ago, imagine the endless possibilities we could do on livng students. With the acuracy and many beneifts of this tecnology clasrooms would become not only more interesting and maybe even fun but they would be more productive than ever before. Overall the Facial Action Coding System would be a very useful tool for both students and teachers. With students becoming bored and confused less classroom productivity would increase and even the students grade would increase. Without testing these technologies in actual classroom enviroments we will never know the true impact this technology could have on our learning experience."
5577,0,"Facial expression can show many emotions and do reveal a lot of information about how someone feels or thinks. The way people think and feel is very complex although we have never really been able to tell how people truly feel, there is now a computer that is able to ""calculate"" emotions. Many studies have been done with this computer, such as the study at University of Illinois studying Mona Lisa's facial expression painted by Leonardo Da Vinci. ""The computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles in called action unit."" This shows us how much research humans have done with this computer. This computer many be used in various settings wheither it be in school, interview, jobs, businesses and etc. The computer many change the way we study, it can help us improve in many ways. Humans may study the facial expressions mad during the lecture at school or presentation at a business meeting. This will help us know what to change because of the way their facial expessions have changed through out the meeting. Through out schools in the United States there are students that do not want to speak up when they are confused. This is one of the many reasons schools have not had their students advance. The students may feel embrassed or think that they are the only ones that do not understand the lesson but with this new technology there could be many advances done. It will give teachers the opition to use the computer in class to see what the student is thinking through out the lesson and notice when they have not explained something very throughly. It lets use advance in students education levels and make sure they get the best education schools can offer. The computer will change the way the world works for the better. Technology is spreading more and more. The way people think currently is advancing and improving in many ways. Technology is already slowly advancing by using ""cookies"" which looks at what you have been searching up and are interested in. Cookies are being used all the time. When a person searches something on google and then they go to a website with advertisments they may be similar to what the person has been searching. This is what the computer would be doing. They will be able to put it on computers and if you smile a Web ad might appear about similar ads. The same way it is used in the businesss world they may be able to use it in the educational world, to see and know the students interest. The computer brings use new and better ways to improve as a whole. This will be the start of something new. Not only is it very interesting, it is amazing for humans education. This can help us realize our mistakes in various settings."
5603,0,"Throughout this article, we learn a new technology called ""The Facial Action Coding System."" This system is used to identify human emotions. Now, the real question is if this technology is valuable to the students in a classroom. Is the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students valuable in the classroom. To begin with, a classroom computer could recognize the students emotions. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" On the otherhand, the software might not be so great. Throughout the text, the scientists state that the emotions are universal, and that everyone has the same few emotions. ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise,anger, disgust, fear, and sadness..."" ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" observes Dr. Haung. What if the machine predicts, or reads the expression wrong, than what? Not everybody's expressions are the same, some may vary, and with only six basic emotions, the machine may not be able to properly read what a person is feeling. In summary, I have come to the conclusion that the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students is very valuable. Not other can it read their emotions, but it can improve their learning experience. Their are a few things that the machine may not be able to do, and a small chance of error whilst reading an emotion. But, overall, the technology is valuable to students of the classroom."
3368,0,"I think that the author who wrote this is right about studying venus despite the dangers it presents. I say this because in the text he mention that ""that not long ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have various forms of life"" this makes me think that if we start studying about venus and get enough information we need to know if there is form of life in venus we could fnd many things about this planet and maybe make life there. I also believe that if we were to find interesting information about venus we would have to send some type of living organism to prove that we could have some type of life somewhere other than earth. First, i think we would have a rough time finding ways of life in venus but i think that we are able to do something like this and succed. i believe that we can succed but there will be obsticles in the way like "" the radiation would not exceed like earht leves."" or such as "" the temperatures would be warmer then here in earth."" they are many things that would not have a human being survive but in the other than there is a few things that have a possibility of life. in the text it had menton that "" conditions like in venus are far more extreme than anything humans ecounter on earth."" Next, some positive evidence to prove the statement of this author would be "" venus may once have been the most earth-like "" they refer that out of all the planets we have venus is the only one that has similar things to earth which there could be a 50/50 chance of life. venus would allow scientist to float above the fray. venus could be our nearest option for a planetary visit how to text stated. i believe it would and could happen if we tried. Lastly, In the text we have seen good and bad evidence to prove the authors statement but we have not mention that ' venushas value not only because of the insights but because human curuosly will likely lead us to many quality intimidating endeavors"" so us as human can bring soemthing to this research. In conclusion, I think that the author is right about studyng venus even though we have cons about doing this. i still believed that if we were to do something like this we wouldnt succed the first time but with effort we can and find ways of life in venus."

9103,0,"Do you want a new technology called Facial Action Coding System to determine your emotional expressions. I Don't think that a technolgy that reads your emotional expressions is valuable for students because not a lot of people like to show there emotional expressions and may feel uncomfortable with this. It may pretty cool that a technology could show us our emotional expressions, but do we really need a technology to tell us our emotions when we could do that ourselves. Now in our generation students will probably take this technology as a joke and be distracted by this. In the text it states in paragraph six, "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming cofused or bored."" This Technology would be taking over because based on the students emotions it would do the lessson a different way to entertain the students, every student could have a different or the same emotion. You could change the lesson in different ways to change the students emotions, but do you really need a technology to do that for you. What if the technology has issues and doesn't work it just makes it less valuable. I wouln't want a technology to tell me my emotional expression and change it by doing something in a different way. Making more technology is not valuable because now we are starting to rely more on technology than ourselves. Also, this technology becomes a distraction because the more we know about it you'll have students that play around too much and make different emotions on purpose to mess with the technology. Befofe making this technology, it would of been fair if the students and staff in the school could take a vote to see if there comfortable with type of new technology. There are students that will approve of this technology and there are students that wil not approve of this technology. So i don't think that the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because of the changes it makes on how we are feeling and the possible malfunctions that could happend."
8117,0,"Across classrooms throughout the country, students often struggle to stay focused while learning. Lectures, homework, and the stress that is caused by school is often enough to overwhelm students. Certain students may do great in this type of environment, but we should strive for every child to be able to recieve an education in the way they see fit. The introduction of the Facial Action Coding System could very well be the solution to helping children recieve the education they deserve. The Facial Action Coding System, or FACS for short, is a new software that is able to read expressions on a person's face and determine that person's emotions based off of the expression. If this technology were equipped in webcams in schools throughout the country, students would have a much better learning experience. The software would be able to sense how a student is reacting to a lesson and would be able to modify it accordingly for the student if needed, as Dr. Huang of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois mentioned. This software could help students stay engaged in their education and increase the overall effectiveness of teaching. One may argue that students' expressions would not always be read with accuracy, but that is false. The Facial Action Coding System works by tracking all 44 major muscles in the face. The movements of these muscles are closely related to six basic emotions: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. By tracking 44 different muscles, the FACS ensures that it's results are accurate. Dr. Huang previously stated, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression."" As Dr. Huang explained, even if an individual's expression is not as prominent as another's, it will still be able to be read by the software. Overall, FACS can be used for many purposes, including school. As aforementioned, FACS would work by changing lessons to better fit a student, based off of their reactions to a lesson. If used in school, FACS will most likely increase the effort put forth by students, the effectiveness of a lesson, and the overall attitude of a community. If a student enjoys the content and the manner in which it is being taught, the effort given by that student will increase. In addition, if students are content with their grades and classes, this feeling of happiness and positivity will most likely pass off onto parents and teachers. To conclude, it is clear that FACS should be utilized in classrooms due to the immense effect it can have on students, teachers, parents, and education as a whole."

To begin with here an American there was been a large drop in the percentage of 16 to 39 years old getting a lincens while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age mr. sivaks research has found. study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. As of april 2013, the number of miles driven per personj was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. part of the explanation certaintly lies in the recession,because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway. Michael sivak said ''what most intrigues me si that rates of car ownership per househoild and per person staretd to come down two to three years before the downturn. many socialogists believe it will have a beneficial implicantions for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants. but in France diesel fuel was blamed since France has a tax policy thatt favors diesel over gasoline. dieselsmakes up 67 percent of vihicles in france compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of western Europe. while in america millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays reamins an open question."
2259,0,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author attempts to inform readers of the importance of researching and discovering Venusian history and geology, the challenges of reaching Venus in order to study, and possible solutions to these challenges. The author displays insentives to grow interest in the discovery of Venus and to help readers understand the reasons for scientists wanting to research venus. By strategic reasoning the author to reels in the audience makes them to want to explore the Venusian quest for themselves. The first method displayed by the author is the use of explaining the danger of the project. The author tells of the dangers of the Venusian surface and how many prior times the National Aronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has had failed attempts to do quality research on the planet itself. This strategy of showing the dangers first is used to grab the reader's attention and make them want to listen more for the solution. The dangers of Venus exploration is a perfect set up for starting to offer some solutions. By this point the author transitions to their second method starts explaining the facts of the event. Venus is currently not able to support life, but possibly at one time was. The author tells of how long in the past Venus could have looked like our Earth, with bodies of water and structured land. This is reinforced with the fact that Venus still today has certain earth like qualities such as mountains, valleys, and craters. This curious discovery has prompted NASA to research more about Venus and figure out if in some way this deathly planet may still be able to support life. But how? This question that the audience is bound to ask is a perfect transition to the final method, which is the hopeful solution. NASA wants to send a strong, durable, and stable blimp of sorts to hover around the outside of the planet, around 30 miles away. At this distance the planet appears to have many more Earth-like qualities, such as atmospheric pressure, and a closer temperature. Though this solution only would send humans to the outskirts of the planet, there could be another solution to sending more devices to the surface of Venus. Former ideas for mechanical computers could be of value here, for they do not need electronics, and therefore are more durable. This idea would have the potential to allow a robot to stay on the surface for three weeks. This would grant NASA enough time to even collect samples to study back on Earth. Both of these theoretical solutions reasure readers that there is potential to study Venus more in depth, and even send life there for more research. With all three of these methods the author informs readers of happenings with NASA and simplifies information to be easily understandable. The author displays a problem, lists the known facts that created the problem, and then proposes solutions to give the audience the potential final outcome. With these the author effectively accomplishes the goal of showing the challenge of exploring Venus."

16625,0,"Computers and technology are the fastest growing industry in today's world. Technology is used in most of Americans' lives. With technology growing and expanding more and more things we do in our everyday lives are becoming obsolete, including driving. Driverless cars are the next big thing. I think this could push us so far into the future. The text states, ""The cars he forsees would use half the fuel of today's taxis."" This would benefit everyone in so many ways. One way is pollution. Pollution is such a massive global issue. With only half the fuel needed to power an automatic car, only half of the pollution would occur. With so many people having cars, this would lead to an amazing drop in pollution. The text also states, ""The cars he forsees would offer more flexibiltiy than a bus."" This would also lead to a massive decrease in pollution. If a car is flexable, you can make it bigger. With a car being bigger, while using only half of the fuel we use today, we can fit more people on a single vehicle for cheaper, while being safer, and being better for the environment. This is better for an individual consumer and the global population all together. The text also states, ""In reality, Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009. Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash."" In my opinion this is absolutely amazing. These cars, traveling half a million miles, increases everyone's quality of life. This could lead to so many lives being saved. A person driving home from a party would be so much less likely to crash into someone because they will not be controlling the vehicle. A counter argument to driverless cars to being the future is the law. The text states, "" If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer."" This does raise some questions about the safety of the driver, manufacturer, and the pedestrian if someone happens to get injured. This would definitely have to be reviewed before we actually sit in our own, personal automated cars. In conclusion, driverless cars are upon us. Although we are not sitting in one today, it is only right around the corner. Driverless cars are for the better when dealing with pollution and safety. We need to let the future in because it will drive us to greatness."
3267,0,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author supports his claim by stating that the reasoning for continuing research on how to get to Venus's surface is, because it was once very similar to earth's surface long ago. Astronomers claim that Venus probably had oceans and supported many different life forms just like Earth. The author states that the value of returning to Venus seems idisputable due to the fact that it is sometimes our nearest option. Since it is our nearest option and giving consideration to how long time frames of space travel are, this is a pretty good claim. So far the author's claims are, that it is our nearest option and it was once very much like Earth and habitable. The only problem now is Venus's surface conditons. On Venus's surface the temperatures average is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than it is on Earth. However the author goes on to state that NASA has a possible solution to the conditions on Venus's surface. NASA's possible soolution would be to have a blimp like vehicle hover 30 miles above Venus's surface. Even though the temperature would be around 170 degrees Fahrenheit it is still survivable for humans. However researchers cannot take samples of Venus's surface by hovering in a ship safely above the planet. The author states that instead of looking at the problems as risks we should look at them as challenges. The author claims that striviing to meet the challenges presented by Venus has value because human curiosity will likely lead us to many more equally intimidating endeavors. Also that our travels beyond Earth should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. So the authors claims for furthering research on how to get to Venus are, it's the nearest planet to us, it used to be very hospitable and much like Earth, and that we should see the risks as challenges and find ways to get past them. The author supported these claims very well."
10510,0,"The face on Mars wasn't created by aliens, in fact it has no connection to alien life form at all! When the face was first discovered no one had really known much about it so people started hopping to conclusions before anything could be proven or tested. That is until NASA started looking into this ""face on Mars"". The face is actually a huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. That's it- simply a rock formation but the shadows casted upon the crevices gives the strange formation the appeal of a human face. When people began to become even more skepical, on April 8, 2001, NASA had the Mars Global Surveyor draw close enough to snap another picture of the face. The day was a cloudless summer day in Cydonia. NASA's serveyor camera had taken a crisp photo of the face in highest resolution. ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel."" so you can discern things in a digital images three times better than the pixel size. So NASA, and the rest of the world, had a more clear and better picture of the face everyone was talking about. Although the face may seem strange, it could be a rather common landform for Cydonia. ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West."" Although this one may seem to stick out from the rest, it could merely be the shadows playing tricks on the human mind. ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" The landform may very well be common around Mars, it's merely the shadows ghosting around the landform that causes it to look like a face! So in reality, there is no alien life form connected to this rock formation at all!"
11058,0,"My argument that I am going to state in this essay is against driverless cars. The idea to me sounds unsafe and dangerous. I think that driverless cars are a bad idea because, they can malfunction at a point of time. Although the companies have an idea of alllowing the car to be able to alert the driver when he/she should take control, it might not work one day and could cause a horrible accident. Yes, the idea sounds great, but not all good ideas are safe especially when involving lives. Another thing that tells you that this is an unsafe idea is that although it is a ""driverless car"", it still needs someone to take control when it can not. Which shows a red flag to which these cars are not safe. From what I read in the article, I think that the best way to drive a car is to drive it yourself. The article itself notifies that a human must still take control when the car can not, and that is basically what you do to when the car isn't driverless. No matter what, a car must still have a driver to assist it. Having a real person monitor, control, and drive a car is the best and safest way, to me, for transportation."

This is what we have learned that we supposively do. If we can't pick out who will rule over us, then what are we doing with ourselfs? We deserve to have a choice in choosing who will rule our country. The Electoral College was established by our founding fathers in the Constitution. Constitutions like these eventually get revised. This method is too outdated. Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have all agreeded that to abolish the electoral college. Popular votes was something they all had in mind when choosing the president. It was shown the 60% of voters would prefer a direct election, than having the electoral college. That's more than half! The best argument against it, is the the disaster factor. From this, the system keeps allowing worse and worse things every year. In the Electoral College, size and population of the states matter a lot. It can be unfair for a smaller state with a smaller population against a bigger state with a wider population. It is a winner-takes-all situation. Candidates don't spand that much time in states that they know they aren't going to win in. The electoral college is unfair and very outdated. We must adapt to the new demand of freedom of choice. In short, it is better for a voter to know that their vote was counted towards something big. Maybe it was their vote that changed it all. We, as the United States of America, we have learned that our freedom is earned, not given. By this, it may take a while to convince those around that the Electoral College should be taken down or revised. We should get what we voted for because our voice counts."

Our travels on Earth and beyond should be expanded to meed the very edges of imagination and innovation. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author supported the idea that stuyding Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because it is reffered to as Earth's ""twin"", and Venus is a very challenging place. First, Venus is often referred to as Earth's ""twin,"" In Paragraph 2, the authur stated, ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."" This means, there are a lot of similarities between Earth and Venus. Venus must be a very dangerous planet but it was called our sister planet. If we reffered the Earth as a human and the Venus is the real sister, why won't the Earth wants to know more about her sister Venus? Therefore, stuyding Venus is very important pursuit despite the dangers. Also, Venus has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. On the planet surface of Venus, the temperatures average is over 800 degrees Fahranheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. The planet is a really dangerous place to live in, and study showed that human can survive for a few hours. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. However, the author stated, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" This means that even though Venus is the hottest planet, it was once a very lovely place which covered with ocean. This planet is a very challenging and interesting place to examine because even today, Venus still has some features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Inconclusion, the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" pursuide his audience well because Venus is the Earth's twins, and is a very challenging place to examine more closely. In Paragraph 5, the author stated, ""The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has one particularly compelling idia for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray."" This explained us that there is no oxygen or there is only a little oxygen in Venus that made people float above the fray. Visiting Venus is not an easy conditions, but survivable for humans. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."

There are a lot of experiences for you but it does take a lot of dedication and hard work. When World War II was over in Europe, many places and countries were destroyed. If you join the Seagoing Cowboys program, you can help these places and countries regain what they lost like their food supplies, animals, and a lot more. This program visits many places that were ruined during the war and one of those places is Greece. If you are 18 and wish to be drafted for military service, this is an amazing opportunity to do so. You can help your service if you join this program because you are helping already by shipping animals to where they belong. Besides helping people, you are also allowed to experience adventures and visit many unique places. These trips are an unbelieveable opportunity for small-town people. You get the benefit to visit China, Europe, Greece, Italy,and many other places. Seeing the Acropolis, an excavated castle in Crete, the Panama Canal, and taking gondola rides are also other benefits of the Seagoing Cowboys program. The Seagoing Cowboys program is much more than a adventure and it might open up the world to you and many others. Someday you might even be grateful for this opportunity and you might finally be aware of other people's needs and countries. Do you think that you can participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program?"
8129,0,"The use of Facial Action Coding System created by Dr Haung has recently become more popular in our daily lives. With the Facial Action Coding System images are being dected on the emotions conveyed from the person in the image. What value does reading emotional expressions bring to the students in a classroom environment? Having the Facial Action Coding System will help students enhace personally in a classroom environment by understanding how others peers work so they can better improve and achieve as a student, create a safer environment, and excel as a school in whole. Being students in an environment in which you do not understand how others comprehend can be difficult. With the Facial Action Coding System students are able to understand how their peers interact with different obsticals thrown at them. For example if you take a picture while a student is working on a certain assigment you can tell how their emotions are interacting with that certain assignment with the help of Facial Action Coding System. If a numurous amount of students look displeased with that assigment you can try a different aspect on teaching so the students can understand the learning technique better. Students will not have to be embarresed about conveying their emtions so the Facial Action Coding System will help in their favors. Better explained by Nick D'Alto, ""...Your frontails pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're surprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger,"" (Making Mona Lisa Smile paragraph.3). Having this type of technology in a classroom is important for a safe environment. Using the Facial Action Coding System you can detect if a student is angery or upset so an advised adult can help solve their issues before it gets out of hand. Most unsafe environments start off from unhealthy student relations and emotions. Knowing if a student is upset from the beggining will help a classrooms environemnt by keeping the students safe. As Dr. Haung explained, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal...."" (Making Mona Lisa Smile paragraph. 4). Students convey the same facial expression for certain emotions but at different degrees. As each students uses certain muscular action units students can better understand the class. Using certain emotions in group activities and can help a student better understand a concept rather than having a group of the same emotions. If group work was done with multiple emotions working at once the students grades would get better as a whole and help excel the school greatly. This would be done in an efficient manner with the help of Facial Action Coding System if used in the classroom environment. Understanding how others peers work so they can better improve and achieve as a student, create a safer environment, and excel as a school in whole is important for a student. With the help of newly designed technology, Facial Action Coding System, there is much more value in a classroom environemnt. This is not only benifical to the students but to the professors and teachers as well. The value of the Facial Action Coding System is too strong to object for a classroom environment. This can all happen with the Facial Action Coding System, thanks to Dr. Haung, which shall be greatly appreciated not only in the outside world but the classroom space as well."

The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" says that it is hard to explore venus but he supports exploring Venus very well. The author says that Venus is often referred to as Earth's twin and that it may once have been just like Earth. He says, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" This could mean that we could find remnants of an old civilization that died many ages ago. We could see what happened to them and see if there is any other form of life still alive today. Even if people say that it can't be explored because the conditions on Venus will destroy the technology we send to it, scientists are developing new ways. Scientists are working with a very old technology with cogs and wheels because they will be more durable than electronics on Venus. All in all the Author supported the study of Venus very well. I think that if anyone heard that Venus most likely used to be like Earth, used to have life on it, and could possibly still have life on it would want it to be explored."

For the simple fact that anything can happen while your in the car what if the car malfunctions and it hits something before it gets your attention. And a question that I have is will the car stop as it gets your attention or will it keep going? Also in the passage it says what if road blocks lie ahead of the car will it stop? But I'm not totally against it because it seems like they have the right idea. In the passage it states that the combination of the censors that the cars will need and the laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings. The combination of all this input is necessary for the diverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel! But I don't think that this makes the cars driverless I look at it more as assisting. Also the process will be very expensive, for a simple radar it costed two hundred million dollars! Also what is a driver goes to sleep on the road a simple vibration will not wake them up if anything it soothing! Alot of accidents may occur from this feature. Also they don't even have the new laws following accidents in the new Driverless cars, maybe some people will think that the new laws are unfair and that can stir up alot of problems! Lastly I think that the drivers will get very bored having to wait on their turn to drive, and how will the car know you destination will you have to make all the turns for the car? I really just think it isn't a good Idea there are to mny flaws that come with Driverless cars!"
10369,0,"People have been dreaming of driverless cars for many decades. It has been visioned in movies and on television. Today, it is possible to make a driverless car due to the advancement in technology. It was an impossible task back in the 1900's due to the lack of technology and the cost for other parts. Altough driverless cars seems pretty far stretched, it is coming closer than you think with all these different car manufacturers trying to be the first to accomplish this task. People were not able to construct a driverless car due to the lack of technology. Now that we have the technology, we can construct a car that is more efficientand safer to other people. The idea for driverless cars started back in the 1900's. Driverless cars were not the first idea as smarter roads began to start being everyone's dream.Man people tried to construct smarter roads by many different way including roads that had an electrical cable to a road that used magnets with alternating polarity. These ideas were actually usable but they were too expensive to even start making. Sensors back then costed way too much money for people to even think about them. They were also not as advanced as tehy are now. With all these new improvements, many manufacturers can now make these driver less cars. Driverless cars can change many things like the transportation system. In the article, it talks about how these driverless cars are going to allow a public-transport taxi system. This will allow people to be taken to their destination with more comfort. The article also states that these driverless cars will be far more flexible than a bus. These driverless cars are also expected to use about half the fuel taxis today use. These types of cars will be more fuel efficient and be safer to the environment than today's taxis. These cars will not be only for transportation but they could be bought and used as a normal car. With less fuel being used, more people will end up bying the car to save some money on gas. Finally, these driverless cars are predicted to be more safe than a human driving behind the wheel. The article states that these driverless cars are going to have many sensors taht are going to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel. There are already sensors in many cars today including the Prius, that detects if you are going to hit someone before it happens. We can make more improvements to sensors and computers to allow them to accomplish tasks that humans can not do. Driverless cars are going to change the way we live by making us feel safer and more comfortable. These cars are now able to be made due to the improvements in our technology. Sensors and computers wil be used to make these cars able to do things humans behind the wheel can not do. This will make it safer for the people in the car and also people outside the car. These cars will use less fuel than todays taxis, making them a great alternative transportation system. These cars will be an excellent invention that should be developed and allowed on the streets in the near future."

The driver has it worst since he is the head of the vehicle, if he is not on full alert then a crash is likely to happen. Also not mentioning at night driving when you start to get sleepy. Luckily this will all change thanks to new technology and manufacturing. For many years car accidents happen all over the world and whats the reason? No other then humans US! We may say we drive carefully and we probably do but too bad not every human can think like us. There is humans that drink and drive for example that can cause to an accident, another is careless human driving as for young and old people not being fully alert on the road. These are just some of the few reasons why accidents happen. This will all be solved with Driverless cars! Just think about not having to touch the steering wheel, or not having to set your foot on the brake pad because the car already does it for you! Please don't get me started on the fact that it has a GPS system that knows the roads! Doesn't that just sound amazing!? All thanks to new technology. Your probably asking yourself ""What if it malfunctions?"" well I got just the answer. These new cars are right now still being tested on them and yet so for this is what they say"" Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009. Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash, but so far, Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents."". As you have read it is not fully completed but still being worked on, with that being said be towards driverless cars and not against it. As I come to a conclusion I'd like to say let the future begin and bring new things to us. Driverless cars, floating house, and even robots, lets not stand in the way of a bright new bright era."

There are multiple reasons for accidents on the road as is, imagine adding a malfunctioning driverless car to the mix. although this articel states that the cars aren't completely driverless, it still could be a major issue on the roads.(P2) For example, what if the human driver were not paying attention and letting the car drive, a danger ahead, be it an accident or some other immediate danger, and the car doesnt detect it quickly enough, or even detect the danger at all. Who would be at fault? These driverless cars are very unsafe in todays unpredictable world. The article also states that the cars aren't driving themselves, but assisting the human driver. These cars can only handle speeds of up to 25mph. (P7) this may be effiecent for a small town, but how is it helpful to the rest of the world? In paragraph 2 of this article the writer mentions Google cars. These cars can only drive under certain conditions, therefore limiting it's uses and making the car somewhat irrlevant to every day life. These cars are a danger to young drivers. Young drivers are very easliy distracted. If one of these young drivers were to have access to one of these cars and were to be distracted while the car drove itself into possible danger, this could result in major tragedies. Driverless cars are not a safe alternative to people driven cars. There are many concerns manufacturers have to take into consideration before developing these driverless vehicles."

The Face was originally discover in 1976, by the photographers aboard NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft. In the picture taken in 1976, you can clearly see a face in the landform. But in the picture taken in 1998, the atmosphere was extremely cloudy, so if there was any indention in Mars's base, you couldn't see it because of the clouds. Because of this, scientists went out on another attempt to capture a good image of The Fcae on Mars, and they succeeded. The picture that was taken in 2001 clearly showed that The Face was no longer there, which lead scientists to believe that it was a combination of natural landform and the shadows casted from the sun's rays that made that particular spot look like"

The author states ways to keep humans safe, solutions to the design concepts of computers and all of the untapped potential that venus has if humans are able to overcome the obsticle of its deadly surface and atmosphere when it comes to understanding how life came to be. To begin with. The author gives ideas on how to keep humans safe to support his clames when he gives a solution made NASA and that solution is ""NASA's possible solution to hostile on the surface of Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray"" This is a very possible solution to keeping humans safe and this would be done by making the spaceship float with blimps. It's a way to keep humans safe so therefor it supports his claim very well. Furthermore another way that the author supports his claim is when he or she gives solutions and a conept of how computers should be build and how they will help scientist explore the surface of Venus more efficently "" By comparison systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces"" He uses this to support his detail because it fits pefectly with his reasons why humans should explore Venus and how it can be acomplished. Lastly the author does a great job when he or she states how close Venus is to earch and how Venus most likely used to be covered with oceans and how it could have supported life which would give us a more vast understanding on how life came to be. It would be revolutionary infomation if scientist were to explore Venus safely The Author does a great job when he or she is supporting his or her claim of ""Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents"" because the author gives us solutions from experts such as NASA about solutions to the dangers of exploring Venus. The authos also gives us ways of how computers and spaceships can be build to survive the hellish atmosphere of Venus for longer which will give scientist a great chance to study what was once on the planet.

6296,0,"Using new technology to ""calculate"" peoples emotions will be a new and very advanced way to comunicate wiht others. For example, someone could just scan a person's face and tell if they're worth talking to or not. Also, some people may not want to be scaned and get told their emotions. The only people that should get this kind of technology is either, police, therapists or, people who willreally use them to study people. Most people will not wants to be scanned by this new type of technology because, will probably not know what its used for. For example, the person may be scanned without their consent or the person can be a lot older and could make a big deal about it. Also, someone may not approve of this software being used by anyone because it will be to advanced or not good enough. The FACS software is going to be the new way to read a persons facial expressions. FACS (Facial Action Coding System) can ""constuct a 3-D computer model of the face and read all 44 major muscles.

But many researchers are working on innovations to allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus. Also NASA is working on other approaches to try and study living organisms or living objects on Venus and they have tested electronics made of silicon carbide to find out if it would last long on the planet and the electronics have lasted up to three weeks in these conditions. They are also testing mechanical computers which were used in WWII during the 1940s. In conclusion studying organsims on Venus and going there would be very different and it is beyond the limits of danger and doubts but we should expand the very edges of imagination and innovation."
23333,0,"The Electorial College is the way us United State citizens vote. ""The foundinding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" said a passage known as ""What is the Electorial College?"" written by, the Office of the Federal Register. There is what people say is a argument wether or not to keep this Electoral College method or go back to our popular votes. I believe we should keep the Electoral College, without it there is no possible way to believe that every single person who voted actually paid attention to who they voted for and the people they voted for belief's. The whole point in voting is to choose who you best believe depending on beliefs and what they say they will do. You should not vote if you beleive the one guy has the best hair or you like his tan ect. So i write this to you my state senator that we should keep our ways since it's there for resons and those reasons are... number one, you will be certain of the outcome. Number two, the electorial collge shows that no matter what you choose it will be everyones president. Number three, since the US have big states the electorial college keeps that ballenced. ""A dispute over the outcome of an Electorial College vote is possible -it happened in 2000-but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electorial College invariably exceeds his share of popular vote."" says a reason I agree with in a text called ""In Defense of the Electorial College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" from ""Slate Magazine"" by Richard A. Posner. I agree with this manely because it is highely unlikely to get a tie in the Electorial College because there is a even number of a elctors.538 to be exact. ""The Electorial College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, ect.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" from ""Slate Magazine"" by Richard A. Posner. I agree with this reson manely because even if you get the popular vote doesnt mean you become president, the expression ""Everyone's President"" in this text means to me that with the Electoral College you won't have the good percentage of the voters who voted and not cared who they picked gets stopped with the Electoral College. ""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balence that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution..."" from ""Slate Magazine"" by Richard A. Posner. This quote from the same passage as reason one and two came from just basically states that even if you have a big state with a big population doesnt mean the majority in that state that voted for someone will nessicarly get that same person. This helps keeps this system balenced. Everything that i have stated that was from these passages i strongly agree with. Well Senators, you might have to argue something like ""But how do we know the Electorial electors are actually voting for who they should be voting for?"" Or another one would be ""what if the voters have a hard time figuring out which is which Electorial elector."" Well thats a simple one because yes it can happen but its as rare as someone who puts ketchup on pizza. And if they dont know the facts about who is who maybe they shouldnt be voting because seriously like i said dont just vote to vote you should vote if you know information about what you are doing and who you are voting for snd most importantly why? So I have listed my reasons and beliefs now its up to you to agree with me or not but just belive that the Electorial College was made for a reason, and that is to make voting much more fair and simple. Have a nice day."

The electoral college is not an actual college, in fact its not a place at all. The founding fathers wrote it in the constitution as a comprisie between the election by the people or by congress for president. Some of Americas most iconnic people even agredon abolishing the Electoral College,and i agree. In the system of the Electoral College the voters are not truley voteing for the pesident,but for there states elctors. The state electors are the ones who then vote for president. The electors can be anyone who does not hold public office. In simple terms the Electoral College is not fair to voters. The reson behind this is the winner take all system that each state has in place. So the canidates dose not waste time in states they know they have no support or chance of winning the popular vote. A dispute over the Electoral College's final decision is possible,for example it happened in 2000. However it is less likely than an arughment over the popular vote. This is because the winning canidate's share of the Electoral College undoubtably execeeds the share of the popular vote. With the Electoral College in place some people dont even see the point in voteing. Overall the Electoral College does more harm than it does good. America is supposed to be about the people, and we are a democracey. We should be the ones picking our own President by popular vote. With the Electoral College in place we are takeing more power away from the people and giving it to the goverment. It may be written in the constitution but its a new generstion and its time for change."

Yes cars do have their advantages but like everything else they also have a few disadvantages. People should limit car usage more all around the world and heres a few reasons why.. Auto mobiles help in many ways they help you get to where your going faster and in a comfortable sitting condition, but although your body is comfortable are you really relaxed? i presume not! Having a car is a big responsability which can also be very stressful. Think about it when you didnt have a car as a kid and young adult you didnt have to worry about if the insurance on your bike is payed, or if there was any mechanical problems with your legs. cars are expensive to buy and they continue to be quite the hefty financial load after youve bought the car too especially if no well maintained. In the article ""IN GERMAN SUBURB, LIFE GOES ON WITHOUT CARS""' Parragraph 3 sentences 4-6 Heidrun Walter says "" When i had a car i was always tense..."" This quote proves the point that having a car is quite stressful, but thats not all she goes on to say ""i'm much happier this way"" Why is she so much happier? cause not having or needing a car lifted a huge load off her shoulders thats one less thing to worry about on a daily basis. Also lets not forget one of the biggest issues in the world POLUTION! Pollution is a huge problem that we constantly see on the news, hear on the radio, and we see every day. One of the worst forms of pollution is the kind thats in the air we breathe to live and cars play a role now alot of people may say ""my one car cant possibly cause that much pollution"" but if millions.. billions of people think the same way then thats billions of air polluting cars driving around the world polluting the air we breath to live! Paris made a great arangement as stated in the article ""PARIS BANS DRIVING DUE TO SMOG"" they talk about how paris banned certain cars driving from one day and other cars the next. All the cars with even numbered liscense plates were to not be driven on monday and vice versa for the odd numbered liscense plates the next day. this was good because it only allowed about half the amount of cars that usually drive on a daily basis to drive. In time this should make quite the noticable difference in the smog and the overall experience of breathing the "" fresh air"". In conclusion we should all limit car usage because it is less stress not having a car helps financially and lifts a great load of responsability off of our shoulders and also if less people drive on a daily basis then there will be much less polution in the air and i dont know about you guys but id rather live longer than drive and die young, but thats just me."

The idea of driverless cars is not a good one because it's expensive, they still require humans, and safety is a huge issue. Driverless cars is not a good idea because of the major expenses. Since the founder of the Google car project believes that technology has finally caught up with the dream of driverless cars the only issue is the cost. One thing that is needed to build a driverless car is radar which costs two hundred million dollars. The people building these cars have to think about where all of that money is coming from. If these cars will still require humans, then why spend so much money making them? These driverless can assist drivers while in traffic because of their advanced technology, but if they are driverless cars then why do they still need humans? In the article it says, ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" This shows that the technology is not fully developed and humans would still have to stay alert while driving. Humans should be the only ones driving because if not it can cause a lot of safety issues. Safety is a huge issue with these driverless cars. In the article it talks about how most driving laws have to focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe. It says, ""...and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers."" This is why in most most states testing computer-driven cars is illegal. It is best to keep these cars off of the roads to insure safety of everyone. Automakers shouldn't spend so much money on making a driverless car if humans will still have to drive them.

Driverless cars is not a good idea because they are expensive, they will still require human skills, and they are not safe on the road."
13645,0,"An unordinary photo captured on Mars had everyone in much shock an excitement. Laying on the red shaded sand, a figure shaped similar to a face brought to haunted grocery stores, Hollywood movies, novels,magazines, and radio talk shows. Although this image has brought good business to people, I'm here to explain to you that the image is false. When this land form was first viewed by the Viking 1 spacecraft, the viewers back at the staion explained that the object was a huge rock formarion, and the shadows around it made an illusion of an eyes, nose, and mouth. This means that no one would know if it really had human facial parts unless you were actually on Mars. Although there was research being done to the photo, many authors explained that the ""face"" would be an easy way to engage attention to the planet Mars, therefore using this discovery for their own personal use. Authors plans definetly worked too; it explains their business with the movies, magazines, novels, etc. Another explanation on why I believe this head shaped object was just a landform is because every time they took a new photo of the same object, it changed. What I mean by this is, in 1976 the object had human face-like characteristics. Then, in 1998 and 2001, a photos taken both these years, the land form didn't seem to look like a face anymore. It appeared to have lines that looked like cracks, similar to ones on the street. This could lead to the conclusion of the object just being shadows that attracted the Vikind 1 and 2 spacecrafts. In conclusion, I believe that the ""face"" on Mars is just a land form. People used it for their own ammusement and business, and the object lost its human characterists after the first photo that was taken in 1976."

These cars in the future may have to use wifi to run. If that is the case, every where in the world will have to have wifi. What happens if the internet goes out one day causing the wifi not to work? All these cars are not going to run because there is not any wifi to connect to. People will be stuck where every they were last when there was wifi. These cars will become useless in this emergency because they are not abe to be used. This is one issue that comes with having driverless cars. Also, if you are on the road and the car disconnects from the wifi, it will not be able to stop so you will just keep going. This could cause some serious accidents. This is my first problem with driverless cars. My second problem with driverless cars is what happens if the car just shuts down. You could be driving down the road and your car may just shut down. Once again, you will just keep going until eventually you either stop or you are in an accident. A lot of electronics these days sometimes just shut down for random reasons. Some of these reasons may be that the car just broke down and gave up because it was being used so much. Another reason is you may have gotten water in something causing the car to just stop and start smoking. This would be terrifying if it happened to you because you will never know that it is going to happen until it actually happens. You may be driving down the road and the car just shuts down and you are left stranded there in the middle of the road not knowing what is going on or that you got water in something. This is the second reason that having driverless cars would be dangerous. My third reason that having driverless cars would be dangerous because hijacking these cars would be so much easier. All that has to happen for someone to hijack your car is they get inside the ""brain"" of the whole car and take over from there. Especially if you have to have wifi for your car, someone could easily just you the wifi to hijack your car. If someone were to hijack your car, you would never know. You would probably just think that the car is just malfunctioning but really someone may be trying to kill you and you have no idea. I would be terrified to own a driverless car because it would be so easy for the professional hackers to take my car over and try to kill me. Some people do not even have to have a reason to hijack your car. Your car may just be picked and someone may to decide to ""have a little fun"" with your car. This may cause another accident. This is the third reason that having a driverless car is dangerous. Above are the reasons that owning a driverless car is extremely dangerous. First of all, you may have to have a wifi signal to drive with your car. Having a wifi signal to drive, would require internet every where that people have to pay for. Secondly, these cars could malfunction of just shut down because water got inside something and leave you possibly stranded in the middle of the road. Lastly, someone could simply just hijack your car and kill you because of something you may have done to them or your car was just the first one they saw. In all three of these cases, you could easily get into an accident and be killed or severly injured causing you to miss work for months at a time. This is why I do not like the idea of driverless cars."
3661,0,This is my deatlis to back the witer on his claim how how studying venus is both worthy and dangerousand to explain how the author backs himself up on his claim. He gives alot of good points but a huge point that stood out to me was wehen he said how venus is sometimes called Earth's twin becuase in distance venus is the closest planet to us in denstity and size so pretty much Venus is a mini Earth. Another thing that the author toched on is that Venus nickname The Evening Star the writter put that piece of info about Venus becuase he is explaing how Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky which makes it simple for anyone to spot even a simple stargazer. The last point of evedince the writter used to suppports his claim is the dangerous part oif hsi calim he said that NASA has been studying how they are goinhg to send humnas to study VEnus but the dangerous part of that mission is the surface conditions.
13616,0,"Proving The Face is Just a Natural Landform. Although this face was unexpected,that doesn't nessasarily define that the face has anything to do with aliens. There are majority of theories we can assume from this topic. Few scientist condoned that this mysterious face had something to do with a very unordinary prediction.Some scientist seemed surprised when they saw the photograph of the face on mars. As a scientist, many mistakes are made during observations, but that's apart of human life. Mistakes are casual in everyday life and, all of us make them. In my opinion, I don't think this entertaining outbreak had anything to do with aliens. In fact, they're wasn't a specific sign, or clue that an alien was actually was involved. NASA got a great shot at the face, and the picture closely showed that their was nothing do be deeply concerned about. The face was defineitly rare, but over the years the face continues to fade so it shouldn't be harmful. If it happened to really be an alien, we would know from the recordings, and pictures that were captured. This is a huge topic to discuss, and space can likely be considered as a horrifying setting due to rumors, and scientific observations. Astrounaunts never discovered any issues, or new assumptions by traveling to space. The main point is aliens aren't realistic, you may see them in movies, books, or perhaps may hear about them. An alien was never discovered by NASA, and the face just appeared to be a natural cause. The face could of been anything, but we know it wasn't an alien because there is no proof that the face was an alien, and still isn't as we speak. In conclusion, think about other things that are possible."

In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the author presents both postive and negative aspects of driveless cars. Driverless cars have a more negative aspect than a positive aspect because it can cause many accidents, they're expensive and they are too smart. Driverless cars are faster than any other car,a lot of people are facinated with them but the fact that these cars can steer, accelerate and brake themselves can cause many accidents. These driveless cars dont drive through work zones and around accidents. The car will require the human's attention whenever there's a problem. if the techonology fails whose fault is it? the drive or the manufacturer? One of the biggest concerns about driveless cars is that they're really expensive baecause they have many expensive sensors;sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camara mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors and a GPS. imagine how much all of these things could cost? very expensive and what if one day you wake up and the car doesnt work? imagine how expesive it is going to be to fix it. Lastly, Driveless cars are too smart. They have a very advanced technology. They have all thse sensors and too much technology can be very dangerous for humans, tis technology is not nessesary for hiumans. in Conclusion, Driveless cars can be very dangerous but a a lot people would love to buy them just for the simply fact that it can be more practical, that way the dont have to drive to store if they dont want to or to their jobs or even to another state. There is only four states that have approved the use of this cars. Manufactures believe that more states will follow as soon as the cars proved more reliably safe."
1183,0,"Studing venus is not a worthy pursuit despiting the dangers it prevents, becasue it is dangereous, it can kill anything that lands on it, and becasue it is not a healthy planet. ""Venus is one of the biggest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amature stargazer to spot."" ""In our solar system, venus is the second planet from our sun."" Venus is dangerous because in paragragh two it calims that each previos mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. This issue exapins why not a single spaceship has touched down on venus in more than three decades. Numerous factors to study, despite its proximity to us. A thick atmosphere of almost of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfiric acid in Venus's atmosphere. Why it kills things that land on Venus is becasue on the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times grater than what we experince on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreame than anything humans encounter on Earth: such an enviornment would crash even a submarine accustomed to dividing to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals.According to paragragh 3 its aslo notable, venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though murcury is closer to our sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seekignto land on its surface. NASA has one particularly compeling idea for sending humans to study Venus. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditons by staying up and out of their way. At thirty plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees fahrenhiet. but the air pressure would be close to that od sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radtiation would not exceed Earth levels. not easy conditions but survivable for humans. Claimed paragragh 5. Acording to paragragh 4, long ago venus was probably covered largely with oaceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet's surface is rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountians, and crators. Many resaerchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last longer enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus. Paragragh 8 claims our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."
10549,0,"I think that driverless cars would be useless, the reason that I think this is because ""Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? Wouldnt drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?"" Most people( mostly teenagers) like to go joyriding with there friends or just drive around town to blow off some steam. Another reason that I believe that driverless cars are a bad idea is because what is the user of the car falls asleep and doesnt awaken whenever the car alerts them that they need to take over in a potentially dangoures situation. ""In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. This means the driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when there is a possibly dangours situation. These necessitates of the the car being ready to quickly get the drivers attention whenever a problem occurs."" Another reason is that these vehicals could be extermly costly for the consumer's. All the technology that will be needed to be placed into this car will be costly not only for the company but will also be for the customers. There are also many problems with these cars considering that we do not have all the tech needed for them, Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved. In conclusion I believe that driverless cars should not be mass produced."
9768,0,"I think that the driverless cars that google has made today are enough to prove that they are a definite possability and that it has its positive and negative side. I think driverless cars are the way to go because, car accidents are a large cause of deaths in countries like the US where there are many. Diverless cars could potentialy cut that down if not eliminate it. The google cars have suppossedly driven more than half a million miles without a crash and are still out there, which is enough evidence to show that it could definately save lives. Driverless cars must be the better way to go due to the fact that it eliminates many of the variables that make driving as humans, diffucult. It would take out the nessesity to sleep for the automated car and could run long distances without haveing to stop and rest, which would also be good for delivery companies to start taking advantage of. Computerized cars could even be programed to be able to comunicate with each other leading them to be able to sycronize their paths and speeds and reduce even more risk for everyone. Despite how the laws may look at it automated cars could be safer without a driver than with one. It would even use less fuel to operate, with an integrated efficency system. With the technology that is avalible it may even be possible to soon run a computerized car on solar power and take out the fueling proccess entirely. Automated cars could also become so much more than just a vehicle, it will have lots of technology onboard as well as a powerful computer. Just the addition of the computer could provide many more possabilities and have many more powerful aplications than your tablets or your smart phones. These cars would also be a luxury I don't think these cars will be cheep but may become easier to obtain later on just as most technology."
13429,0,"Isn't it crazy that a face on Mars would be created by aliens? NASA sure seems to think it is. Many sciensts have discovered it's a natural landform. The face on Mars is indeed a natural landfom. NASA has had the Mars Global Survayor fly over Cydonia and take pictures to prove it, as Jim Garvin has said,""We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot of it."" Many people will say that the face on Mars was created by previous creatures living there. The planet humans live on, Earth, even has landforms that humans didnt make that just happen to look like faces, As Garvin says,""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" The face on Mars is nothing but land that has been formed in the shape of a face. The face on Mars has been proven to be a landform. They have taken pictures, the scientists have studied it, and all these studies have proved that the face is just land. In conclusion, sometimes things aren't as they seem."
15725,0,"Twenty five years ago we discoved something different on the surface of Mars. This natrural land form looks just like a human face. Some people believe that it was created by aliens. However, that is not true. There many explanations on how this land form got there, but there is no evidence that claims it was created by aliens. I am a scientist at NASA and I was one of the people who discovered this land form. Although some people have very convensing stories as to how that land form got there, it was not made by aliens. Many people think it is a natrural land form, while others think it was created by aliens. The team of scienctist that discoved this land have talked about how we think it got there, but one of only logical explanation is that it was hit by a meteror. Mars has lots of crators on the surface and it is just that. A crator. There is no way aliens could have made this land form. It is over two miles long. For them to make this it would have taken many of hundreds of years. I personal think that if there are any aliens they would not be an advanced civilization to create something like this. Another reason why they could have never made this is how would the aliens know what a human face looks like. This land form is just like they face on the moon, no one made it. It just showed up after years and years of being hit by meterors and the push and pull of gravity. Personaly I do not beleive that aliens exist. There is no evidence that they live on mars, let alone any other planet. If they do exist I would have no problem with that, but as of right not there is no evidence that they do. Even though some stories are very convensing, there is no way aliens could have made this land form. If there was more convensing evidence then I might reconsider my opinion, but as of right now there is no more evidence. So I will not be reconsidering. The land form is over two miles long which would be nearly impossible for a very underdeveloped society to create. Also how would the aliens know what a human face looks like. Therefore there is no possible way the aliens made that face, it's just a land form."
11420,0,"Imagine you are sitting in a driverless car going down the road, your whole life is depending on whether or not this car can react as well, or better than a human. Now let's say a deer jumps out of nowhere, can the car react fast enough? Does it know when swerving results in a better outcome than just stopping? Better yet, how sturdy is this car? Is it built like a normal one? Is it stronger and can resist more damage than the average car? Is it only a car, or will it come in the form of trucks as well? I believe we all are bound to result in the question of how beneficial is this car? Preferences, will this car meet everyone's prefences? Will a big, burly man want to drive a little smarter car? Will this car fit a family of 8 or more? Will Google and the other manufacturers be able to turn every model of car into a smarter car? That would take a lot of tweeking in the manufacturing process, we would have to either build a twin of each factory so that we could have a variety of models, or we would have to completely change all of the factories we have now. And they expect this to be done by 2020? Does this car have all of the basic features of modern vehicles? Like a radio, phone, AUX option, phone charger. Or is it just a boring car that gets you where you need to go and thats it? I do like the feature that drivers can still take control of the car, but can they do it whenever? Or do they have to wait until a warning sign flashes? How does this car read signs? I understand it can detect objects and stop before you hit them, but how does it know when to stop at a stop sign or a stop light? How does it know where the line in the middle of a road is so that you don't drift into other people's lane? What if it reads the sign wrong? I'm not sure I feel up to relying on this car to keep me safe. What happens if one of these cars malfunction? I mean, after I have a phone for a few years it will begin to slow down and do random things, will this car do the same? And, not only that, but will everyone on earth be required to own one? I think we should choose one or the other, because even though you have a smarter car, doesn't mean that you can't have a wreck with someone who doesn't, someone who is drunk or just recklessly driving with a normal car. If that's the case then there is no need to have a smarter car. In my opinion the smarter car is a good idea, but it's not 100% to my prefernces. There are still a billion questions to be answered, and many features I see wrong about the car. Maybe in time when the manufactureres can answer these questions, I might conciter getting one myself, but until then I think I'm against them."
23621,0,"Being a teen, half a year from getting his license, getting a car is the one thing that benefits being sixteen. But is a car really such a good idea. There are many reasons why having a car is a good idea, but is it possible that the cons of having one out weigh the pros? First things first, a car is the most efficient way to get from point A to point B. It travels fast and most cars now a days have saftey features that prevent serious injuries from an accident, unless the car was being missused in such a way that death is a possibility. So why could it be possible that people are rethinking their decision at buying a car? Well the most reasonable answer of course... money. The amount of money spent on a car each year from insurance to physical damage or new parts is outrageous. So much money could be saved from using bike or bus to get where ever need be. Who doesn't like saving money, this year alone there are millins of people unemployed and can't afford a car so why get a job just for one? That is one of the biggest reasons not getting a car could be a possibility. Another reason to not buying a car could be to keep the body and the enviroment healthy. Not using car to go everywhere would definitily leave the possibility of getting more in shape. Using bike, skate board, and even walking/running. Obesity rate in america is at an all time high. Not only because of cars but because of fast food places and other junk foods possible. Keeping the body in shape is a great pro to not having a car. Also keeping the enviroment healthy is a great factor to not having cars. As seen in source two smog is an over developing threat to the enviroment due to the carbon and diesel left by cars. This not only hurts the enviroment that needs to be protected but causes an inconvieneince to the population due to the smell of the gas and hte wat it blocks light. This is something that needs to be stopped. In conclusion, cars not only cause an inconvieneince to the enviroment but can harm the body as well. Also saving money could be a factor in not buying a car due to insurances and mechanics not having to be paid. Think right America, this could be the savior."

I want this year to be a little different. This year I would like to see only the Electoral College vote for the president. The Electoral College knows all about thinking if the president is good enough for the country, and if he can be a good role model, or also a commander in chief. That is the reason why I would like to keep the Electoral College. I would like the country to keep the Electoral College because they make good desiciosns, know if the candidate person is the right president, and last but not least they might think if the citizens would like this president based on his promises that he would like to keep. For example there are two candidates fighting to be president and it's time to vote and the Electoral College might look over to see if the president looks like he can keep his promise to keep the coutnry safe, to make this a better country or not. That's what they look for in a president. That's the reason wwhy we should keep the Electoral College. When the citizens want to vote for the president as well, they think of the same thing, if he's good enough for our country, and if he is going to keep us safe. The Electoral College knows a lot about picking the right president and they've been doing it for a long time. ""The Electoral College consits of 538 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. That's enough electors to vote wether or not the president should be this person or that person."

It could allow teachers to know which of the children in the classroom are having problems understanding the lesson, allowing the teacher to help them more. This could also help other studys of the human anatomy, as it shows how facial expressions are done and also what they mean. In the famous, ""Mona Lisa"" painting, many people observe her smile and think that she is being forced to smile, and that she is actually scared, frighted, or just angry. Using this computer means that we could debunk/prove this theory. This could also solve crimes, some that have not been solved to this day! This computer could also help with crimes as it could show that if a suspect is making a certain facial expression, they are lying or telling the truth. This could help police catch people who are breaking the law, but not put others in prison for nothing. This computer could help with these problems that occur in the real world, and it would save lives in the process. This would be very helpful in peoples daily lives, and it could help people who have problem such as mental health.

However, many places such as Vauban, Germany are now putting a pause on this polluting production with smart planning movements and new law enforcements. Motor vehicle companies have produced millions of new vehicles, all with the latest additives. Some, with bullet proof window, others with high speed turbo engines. Many csr lovers fancy the best cars and sometimes the most. Cars are the most used mode of transportation, used daily to get people from one place to another. Most have even looked to the future to see flying cars and such things as seen in cartoons and animations. Cars are an attraction for many. These car companies will have a negative outcome from this movement across the globe. Do we really need to take away the cars? Though cars are seen as an everyday tool, is it really safe? Scientists have proven that the smog from these car engines pollute the atmospher. Cold nights and warm days cause warmer layers of air to trap car emissions, polluting the very air we breath. Congestion contributes to the amount of emissions and also the hectic bundle att stoplights and highways. Some have also stated that congestion brings tension in people. Due to this damaged to the Earth, many organizations and countries have enforced laws and rules for a car-free environment. Places such as Vauban, Germany have forbidden any form of car storage and transporting. Paris bans car driving after days of near-record pollution and in Bogota, Colombua many left their car at home for a day to clear the streets and the air. These moements have seen progress woth reviews from many o how the smog free zones release the tension in the people and lower air pollution. In America, transportaion is the second largest source of emissions. President Barack Obama has plans to reduce this statistic. America's statistics shows that its people are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer lincenses as each year goes by. This makes Obama's plan a step closer to being complete. Car usage can therefore be depleted and the atmosphere can be saved. Car companies will have a negative impact from this but these countries are seeing better results from it. Limting car usage is not the end of the world. More transportation is out there and the less cars, the less stress."
24339,0,"Electoral college has helped in many ways. Many people have suggested keeping the electoral college or changing to election by popular vote for the president of United States. I believe that changing to election by popular vote for the president would be best bescause first the more people who vote its easier to determine who would become president and because it will aviod any problems having to choose for president. Changing the election by popular vote can change things in the united states. Now a days alot of things have helped the electoral college but in other cases it has not. Changing to election by popular vote can help by choosing the winner and still having its defenders. Also it may help by when they need to find out the winner they know exactly who it is. They can get their election faster and quicker by changing the election vote to the most popular vote for the united states. People still suggest that keeping the electoral college would be better but chnging it to popular vote would be the best option. Presidents and electors have had trouble with the eletoral college when having to elect for president of the united states. If changing it to popular vote for president it will sviod any troubles and problems when electing the president. They will still have senators and still have enough votes to choose and elect the president and have no problem at all. Like people may think yes, electoral college should stay and should not be changed to popular vote in electing the president but i think that is best. Everyne has their own opinion in matters like this but in this case i think whats best to change the electoral college. In conclusion to this everything is always done for the better and i think that changing the elcetors to popular vote for the president would be easier and less problems for alot of people. Making change is better and helps others. Especially if its changing for the elections and having to do with the president. Everything is better if you choose to elect the president by most votes it creates better things and makes life so much easier."

But if you have a Driverless Car does that mean that the car would only go the speed limit so you could not hurry up to get to work? If you got rearended by a car car drivng on the highway and started spinning out of control would the Drtiverless Car let you take control of the wheel to try and save yourself? These are both valid questions to ask before you take a step into the furture with Driverless Cars. Many people will argue that Driverless Cars would be very helpful the todays busy and nonstop world, but if the elements were out of your control would you feel safe with your life in the hands of a car? I believe that the best way to be safe on the road would be to have a driver in control of the vehicle. Human error will always be a factor in driving but trusting that humans have been trained and have some experience behind the wheel will always over power the risk of taking the chance of a machine keeping families safe while drivng. The manufacturers of the Driverless Cars would also have a heavy weight on their shoulders becuase if the Drivreless Cars gets into an accident who's fault is it? There would have to be careful expamination of the product and what happened during the crash. If the crash were to be the manufaturers fault then the company that the car was produced at could be sued millions of dollars due to many crashes. In conclusion the Driverless Car to me would be a poor decsion for people to buy becuase there are many unknown factors tht deal with this product. the Driverless car has not proven yet that it is safe enough to be out on the roads and to keep people safe."

With the weather always chaning will the driverless car be able keep up or will everybody just have to stop what they're doing? The weather influences driving greatly. You have to be able to drive in any condition, thats why driverless car aren't ready. If the driverless car needs someone to take over when theres road work and accidents, the same thing would happen in dangerous driving conditions. The car could not tell that there is ice on the roads. Sometimes cars hydroplane, the smart car would not be albe to right the car but, just spin out and take the impact and put lives in danger. This would increase accidents or even deaths. These cars aren't safe to drive in conditions like these. The smart car isn't smart enough to be driving in different types of weather or situations. The car can't adapt to driving condtions, so would it be able to avoid things like pot holes and animals that run out in front of cars? Pot holes occur every where, if one of these driverless cars hits one a blows a tire the passenger could be stranded. The car couldnt have did anything to avoid the pot hole, so its not to safe. Then there are animals that jump out in front of cars last second or even people. The road is always changing and things are always happening, i dont believe the driverless car will be able to function in certain situations. Sensors can only sense so much that certain times if there is no person in the driver seat things can go wrong. There are times in traffic that traffic ligths go out and people have to make decisions. The car can not think to stop at a flashing ready light and then yield to oncoming cars. There are situations there a person is the best option. Unless the car can think for it self. The drivrless car is too unpredicatable and can put peoples lives in danger. Accidents occur all the time, i don't believe a driverless car can avoid an ongoing accident. Then there are situations with police, or stolen cars. Would the car give away its owner if they were on the run from the police? How would traffic stops work, would the car be so perfect to not break the law? The car could be harboring fugitives or runways or even kidnapped victims. The car wouldnt be smart enought to know, its going to do what its told and drive. i dont believe that self driving cars are ready for todays society nor will they ever be.

The driveless cars will have a lot of sensors on the car so it will be safe to ride. The car will be able to handle driving functions up to 25 mph. The GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing up into a object. However there will be entertainment in these driverless cars. I think it may be a bad idea because the driveless cars may have some wrng with it and it may cause accident. Some people may want to drive themselves around. some parts of the car could be messed and it could cause it to be unsafe to ride.

9577,0,"Driverless cars seem quite denyable when heard of, but to others, seems like a good fit for their everyday life when needing that extra bit of sleep. The article that I will base my expositioned feelings torwards this topic later on, is speaking on how people in the past or in present time exaggerate how cars would be mobile fit for it to be driving itself without a driver. I see this as somewhat dangerous and I'll explain why. Having a car drive itself with a human inside is terribly dangerous to me because anything can happen like when someone is sleeping to only find out that there is a train in front of them and the car doesn't stop because the car glitches out and then you are tecnically on your own, well not really because you didn't realize that the car didn't stop and you hear a train coming at you and hearing the blairing and resounding sound of horns to only realize that they were too late, and you were to late.This scenario I placed in front goes against the idea of automatic braking systems, or ABS for short. The article speaks on this a bit stating that ""antilock brakes"" were possible because of someone in the Google Car Project said its possible after adding a lot of sensors to the vehicle selected. I see it as adding as many sensors as you want will not stop the amount of glitches it will have. Another problem I see with this article is that if a car is not completely driverless, then why say its driverless at all? According to the article, BMW announced the development of the ""Traffic Jam Assistant"". To add on to that, in that same paragraph, it states that ""none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless"" and goes on to say that ""they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills"". This means that there truely is no reason to have driverless cars if human skills are still needed when driving a driverless vehicle. If a human needs to stay that alert, then why even bother saving up money for a huge bust like this. In conclusion to this argument that I have torwards this article and what it states, my argument and the article could be compared to a dictator and a president as the president being me, the arguer, and the article being the dictator, the talker. Dictators are harsh people, or could be harsh people at times, and that sometimes could change the ways of many people. Me being a president because as a president, they want to make a chaange without pushing so hard or going against ideas of the people and thoose around him/her."
12132,0,"I feel as if driverless cars are more dangerous than useful. The thought about a driverless car seems unrealistic since it's basically an idea we've all had from a movie or a TV show. It seems that driverless cars would be cool to have, but are we focusing more on safety or the fact that they look and sound cool? Although everyone dreams of driving a car without actually having to do anything, the reality of having a driverless car is that plenty of things could go wrong in an instant. For starters, it could catch fire and put you in a deadly situation. Then there's the possibility of it crashing or running over another person, which is not so great. My point is, we have amazing ways of transportation now and probably the best it'll ever be. We don't need insurance companies going crazy after you crash your new car, which you don't even have to drive, into a tree and/or building. Many things could easily go wrong with this resource of transportation and it's best if it'd stay in an idea box, whereas better things can be thought of. Cars that actually require human response aren't as easy as you think, and I feel that the cars we have now are perfectly compatible. As a conclusion to this, the current transportation method is much simpler than anything else would ever be, and with this I argue that we would be better off without driverless cars."
1295,0,"In the essay The Challenge Of Exploroing Venus, the author makes alot of points of why going to Venus would be a hard task to complete but will come with a high reward. Some points that the author makes is in paragraph 2 the author says ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size"". The reason I choose this quote was the reason we chose venus is because it is the cloest planet to earth. They have done many tests to try and land on Venus, some things they have tried in the past is they have sent numerous spacecrafts to land on Venus to see what they have so far. A good reason on why NASA is very interested in trying to get humans on venus is it is a challenging planet for humans to study, they just want to know what goes on, on a whole other planet. Some challenges that they will have to face is the planet Venus has a ""thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets"". Also there are clouds that consume sulfuric acid in the atmosphere also. We all know this can be done but we have to take our time and realize what equipment we need and what other harmful aspects are on that planet. Astronomers are very fascinated by the planet Venus because they believe that at one point they believe at one point is was just like earth a long time ago. In the passage the author states that ""Venus was probalby covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life"". NASA is working very hard to find everything they can about Venus. Some things that they have done are make simplified electronics made of silicon carbide. This item has been tested in a chamber and could last for about three weeks. I believe that NASA and everyone else working in the industry will find a way on how to get humans to land on Mars and stay there for a long time and find everything that they have been looking for."
1252,0,"""If Venus is so inhospitable, why are scientist even discussing futher visits to its surface""? That question is because astronomers are fascinated by Venus for the simple fact, it was a twin to eath. People want to know why Venus is worth it? All of this time,work, and effort researching it, yet some think to be useless. But what if something would happen to earth, and human life wer to go extinct because of it? I'm pretty sure someone wouldn't let that happen, so we'd have to transfer to the next planet that resembles to earth and could possibly change so that humans could adapt. In the text it says,"" Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because the insight to be gained on the plant itself, but also because human curiosity will lead us into many intimidating endeavors"". In my opinion I agree with the author on many levels."
10798,0,"Autonomous cars may seem like an amzing step forward as mankind continues to advance in technology, making our daily lives much easier. However, with much development still needed on the concept, driverless cars may end up being more of a burden than a blessing. The developmet of autonomous cars should be hindered as they will pose as they may pose as a threat to the privacy and safety of drivers. Although manufacturers have come a long way in the advancement of automobiles, they still are not able to create a fully autonomous car. As it is stated in paragraph seven, drivers must still remain alert and be ready to take control of the wheel if they are to enter a situation that recquires them to. This may sound like a good reason why these cars should continue to be developed, but if one is not driving all the time then this could lead to problems. If a driver is not driving for a period of time they will most likely lose focus on the road because they are not actively doing anything in the situation. If a driver isn't focused and an event occurs that they need to take the wheel, then may not be able to react in time. Even today in standard cars drivers are more likely to falls asleep at the wheel on highway roads that have them going in a long, straight path at the same speed. If this occurs when they are activly driving, then what will happen if they are just sitting in the seat while the car is driving itself? What's to stop them from falling asleep? Would we then have to place our lives soley in the hands of our cars? We've all had our computers randomly glitch or shut down without warning atleast one time or another. Now imagaine if that were to happen with our driverless cars. Someone could be on a highway with cars going 70+ mph and the computer operating their car could stop working. Imagine the fatalities an event like this could cause. The problem with technology is that it is not always fully reliable. With this being the case, few people would be able to get into an autonomous car and get on the road trusting their safety with the car. As it is stated in paragraph nine, in the event of an error like this we don't even know who would be at fault. The driver, or the manufacturer. In conclusion, the development of autonomous cars should not continue until the technology is available in a way that driveres can be ensured that the technology will not fail on them. in the event of a driver less car, consumers of the product should be able to know that they are 100% safe. Until this safety is made definite, driverless cars should not be placed on the market."
24600,0,"Since remotely times, the man had look for some way to make his life easier, since primitive hunting weapons, to carriages. The carriages were pulled by horses mostly, and on those times, the most that those animals could do for contamination was pooping but the owners had people to clean for it as well as someone who took care of it. While the times had change, the transportation media has too as well with the cars; which it actually result to be a doble sided blade contaminating with smog. In Paris the government has banned driving due to smog, the smog has caused a huge impact on this city, giving to it cooler nights and warmer days, many habitants blame Diesel fuel, but it does not matter which fuel you would use, it would burn and produce smog anyways. On the other hand, Vauban, Germany, is offering a new life style that many people has decided to adopt; the suburbian comunity has no cars at the streets, people there does not own a car because they do not need it, the public transportation works very well, so it is not a primary need. They can live perfectly without cars, then they are not that necesary. Many people even sell their cars in order to move to Vauban, and had said that their lifes are so much less stressful than when they did own a car. Mothers can let their childrens to play in the streets without thinking that a car is going to kill them, and kids can let go technology if their moms want them to play outside; most of the kids are so attached to technology because it is a way that parents have to keep them away from the streets. Maybe these changes like in Germany were too radicals, but it can start by a day a year like in Bogotá, Colombia where once a year people take a car-free day, being buses and taxis the only ones allowed to produce smog, the violators are charged with 25 dollars fines. Even in the U.S., from 2003 to 2009 young people driving decreased a 23%, young people are considered the most dangerous driving people. There is so much for young people to do that they are not focused on driving, this could be the beginning of a new era, in April 2013 the number of miles per person was equal that in 1995 where the cars where less than right now. There it is even a program in New York promoting car-pooling! But for example, here in Florida the public transportation is not that good, you actually need a car that drives you to the bus station and then take the bus; a bus that will let you on a train station, that train station will offer you a ride of an hour to another bus that takes about half an hour to get to your job (if you live in Homestead and work in Miami). That is about three hours just arriving to your job, every day for five days in a row; that is about thirty hours a week, just to get to your job! But if you have a car, those three hours now are one hour, which seems reasonable (and it is still a lot!). If someone lives at Homestead and needs to do something (which is generally at downtown Miami or Doral) you would have to dedicate a whole day just doing it, if you are going in car because the distance between cities are ridiculous, can you imagine if not having it? For doing something you would have to take two days and do it by parts or wake up at the very morning when it is still dark so you can complete everything by the afternoon. So defenetly the car is a primary need. Analyzing the life style that people at Vauban have, they are less stressed than the average person who owns a car; people starts to be more social with their neighbors because they have to walk everywhere and the faces are the same, so they actually get to know each other. They also got the benefit of a cleaner enviroment because they do not have the daily doses of smog that someone living in a city would have; cars cause the 12% of the contamination in Europe and more than a 50% in the United States. That is a problem that Paris maybe would not be facing right now if they had payed attention to contamination levels. Since World War II, science has been centered on developing new and better cars; can you imagine what would we have right now if some other would center the science in medicicne or something else?. In the United States an 80% of the budget goes to highways while just a 20% goes to public transportation. But, how can people in Bogotá or Vauben survive without cars? The distance between the comercial and suburban areas are close enough so a bus could take you there (just one bus). Defenetly, making the change would be hard due to our attachment to our cars, but little by little we can change or life style."
17334,0,"Have you ever wondered about the planet mars after seeing the pictures that NASA's Viking 1 caught on camera? Well so have I, but it doesn't mean that you conclude that aliens made the landform. Logical explanations can solve what this landform on Mars is. First let me explain to you whatyou hear on the media isn't always true. They can and will tell you whatever you want to hear and let me put enfiesess on the want. Also aliens couldn't have put that their becuase throughout the photos we captured pictures the revealed it is just a butte or mesa. Lastyly people have theoried that we are hiding extra terestoral from them, but that wouldn't be the case it would only benefit NASA not hurt us The media has only made the picture popular to look at a lot of what they say about it isn't true. It been stared in a Hollywood film, appeared in book, magazines, radio talk shows, and in haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years. The media is playing a little game of telephone the first person who told them is right and once it get towards the end it is a lie or the truth stretched. So if you still believe the media that wouldn't be the best idea. Throughout the years we have gathered more pictures and revealed them to you the public so you can see what we are seeing. I don't understand what you guys are seeing differntly than us because all we see is a landform formed there naturaly not by a species. Just like here on Earth most landforms like the Grand Canyon, Niagra Falls, Rocky Moutains, and Mississppi River were all formed naturaly like this landform on Mars. If we tried to hide aliens from you there would probaly be that one smart person to hack into it and find out if we had them or not. It would be bad idea to try to hide it from you and also it would only hurt us. But we want to share what we find here at NASA to let you know what we know. So all those theories by the media and people arn't reliable because it would only benefit us. These are all the reason why the landform on the moon must be a landform and not formed by aliens. The media isn't reliable because it like a game of teleophone and gets passed around to much for the truth to actually be their. Latyl if there were aliens it would help us be preapred for anything and let you do the same. These are the reason why aliens couldn't have made the landform."
165,0,"In this passage the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthly pursuit despite the dangers it presents and my opinion is what this is right. Some astronomers are fascinated by this planet and think what long time ago, probably Venus was covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life. After years on this planet is a very high temperature average of degrees, radiation and additional impediments. The first evidence about why Venus is a worthy persuit despite the danger represents is the temperature average. On this planet the thick atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets, the planet's surface, average is over 800 degrees, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater. At the thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be around 170 degrees. Venus is the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. The more challenging on Venus are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. The second example is the radiation, the solar power would be plentiful and would not exceed Earth levels. The only limited insight on ground conditions what planet can provide have the reason because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, and this why don't can rendering standard forms of photo or videography ineffective. The researchers cannot take sample of rock, gas, or enything else, from a distance. The third reason are the additional impediments what happens on Venus. The geology and weather present erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface. This planes has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, montains, and craters. The conclusion about this text is what Venus is a wothly pursuit despite danger, I'm according with the author's suggestion because in this passage says about what degrees are high, planet's surface, radiation, additional impediments and other information. The previous mission what was on Venus was unmanned because no one spececraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. The conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth and on Venus not a single spaceship has touched down in more than three decades."

Cars or automobiles as the german like to call it are linchpin of suburbs which mean they're affordable. Most middle class families tend to stay around the Shanghai area.

To start off there is many advantages to limit car use. One example would be ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" In Bogota, Colombia they have a car free day every year. A lot of people participate in it and some enjoy it. With that day it lowers car mission and shows people that cars aren't nessary to have. Another example would be, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Without cars people are happier and aren't as stressed as they would be if they still had a car. Next life can go on without cars. One example would be ""Vauban, Germany- Residents of this upscale community are suburban pionners: they have given up their cars."" In this community there is little to no parking spaces. The community is tightly packed together so that it is better to walk places. Not only are their car free suburbas but cars are on a decline. An Example would be, ""Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and gettiong fewer licenses as each year goes by."" Even in America cars are starting to decline.

10426,0,"It has been numerous arguments about rather to except or deny the use of driverless cars. There has been many questions regarding this situation and honesty I think it's time for more answers to be given out. There are positives and negatives on this issue, that need to be addressed. Driverless cars can be a positive aspect. For example the car can have special touch sensors to make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. ""We have to interpret the driving in a fun new way"". To ""interpret"" is to take something in the way you want it to be recieved. Manufacturers considered using cameras to watch that the drivers or remaning focused and keeping their attention on the road. While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver. Many people now in this generation have smartphones, in which they use consistantly. A law has been where you cannot text while driving because of so many accidents and deaths, but thanks to driveless vehicles, you can flip a switch and the car will take control and drive for you while you answer your text message. In this way, the in-car system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big concern. On the other hand, driverless cars can be dangerous in many ways. Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe. The driverless car systems can malfunction or get hacked at any time. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at faul; the driver or the manufacturer? The question will remain uncertain. If driverless cars were called into play, the laws of driving will have to be rewritten which would be difficult. I say this because it is a new set of laws the driving community would have to get used to and follow. Then you have younger drivers on the road with driverless cars. Is that really a good idea? That right there alone can cause casualties and accidents on the roads. I personally think that the world would be so much better without driverless cars. It has been scientifically proven that technology is not reliable nor dependent. Many malfunctions can happen and someone can hack your car and throw you off the road. I know that driverless cars are there to better the rules of driving and help people drive the right way, but there is too many unknown casualties waiting to happen. I think we should stick with the cars and laws we have now. Why change them? What is your postion on driverless cars?"
13618,0,"""The Face"" Have you ever saw something so strange you just had to get a picture of it?! Well if you have, ive done the same! It all started 25 years ago around Mars! Mission controllers back at the Jet Propulison Lab had to be really suprised of what we have found on Mars. As NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling aound Mars and found a figure similar to a human face, believe me when i say it, Yes a human face!!!Although scientists found out it was just an Martian Mesa, i still find it pretty cool! A few days after the photo's were taken, NASA has decided to show everyone and let everyone know about this Matian mesa.The caption resembled a human head. The author thought it would be a good idea to attract attention to mars, and it slowly, but surely did! The human face like structure has became a pop icon, it has appeared in many places and thing such as a film, magazines, talk shows, apppeared in some books, it even made it to the grocery sotre checkout lines ofr 25 years!!That is a really big deal for just a structure on mars!!Certain people thought the face is bona fide evidence of life on mars, which is there own opinion. Global Surveyor as known as (MGS) went ot the Red Planet on September 1997, 18 long years after the Vikings missions ended. On April 5,1998 Michael M. and his Mars Orbiter camerea as known as (MOC) snapped a picture 10 times better then the Vikings!!Also for the first time, Mars Global Surveyor flow over Cydonia. Come to find out, there was no alien monument after al!But no everyone was satisfied with this photo. The camera was really bad considering it had to go through wispy clouds just to see the face.Mission controllers prepaired to look at it again.After a while Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a 2nd look on april 8, 200l. What the picture really had shown was a Martian equivalent to a butte or mesa, they have all been fooled."

Do you guys see in pargraph 7 thousands of people were waiting for that alein moment and what did they get nothing. In the last parogrph of the story it said that it shows that the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, that is a common landform in the american west. he says that it reminds him of the middle Bette in the Snake River plain of idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on mars that what Garvin says. Here is more resons why I think why that it is just a nautral landform. Mars has now water all the water the is there is all traped in the ice so how are the aliens actually geting a drink plus what about the temputers they must be freezing so would you want to live there.

18782,0,"I would be against the development of theses cars, just for the fact if you have no control over ther car the car could crash more likely than a car a person is controlling, because what happens if a car is about to have a car accident and you have no controll to turn the car so it won't crash as well. I feel it would be better if we people took controll of driving and not some system put in the vehicle that controls it. We may have had google cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009, where cars can drive more than a half a million miles without crashing, but at the same time the google car is truly driverless because the car will still have to alert the driver to take over if something goes wrong. In 2013, BMW announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant"", cars can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure drivers keep hold of the wheel in case something goes wrong. None of the cars we drive today are completely driverless, we still have to keep control of the wheel, how fast we go, and sometimes when we stop. Some of the cars can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills. I feel we should just have control on the car for most of the part, just in case something does go wrong because if the car takes over who knows if something will go wrong because what happens if your car can't warn you if something is going wrong. You wont know til something does go wrong, that just isn't safe to me i am completely against the development of theses cars."
10730,0,"In my opinion, driverless cars are kind of a waist of time. Like it says in paragraph 8, ""Why would anyone anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?"". Also it can create other issues like severe laziness, there is already a large amount of people that are very lazy and having a driverless car can make that worse. Some things that might be good about driverless cars are that they can reduce the amount of car accidents we have each year. It can also help people develop practices like focusing on the road at all times and not texting while driving. It helps by what it said in paragraph 8, "" Such displays can be turned off instantly when the drivers trying to text with a cell phone. In this way, the in-car system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big concern."" Some negative aspects can be again causing people to become more lazy and people may become dependent on their car since they don't have to drive it anymore. Overall, even though i said in the beginning that driverless cars are a waist of time, there are more positive apects than negative. If people really start using driverless cars, they might become dependent on their car but they can develop good habits when it comes to driving. If people start developing better habits, we could possibly have a better future."

Even though this might sound like an independent car,the artile says: ""Google cars arn't truly driverless"" The car requires a human behind the wheel to be ready to take control when needed. The cars are unable to do important things on their own. A person is required to take over under certain situations like the following: Backing out of a drive way, A road under construction, or a vehicle accident. If a driverless car is truely driverles, then it should not need a person to take over. Without a person in control, the driverless cars are almost useless. Any car that requires a driver is just like any other car. Since the car is not truley driverless, Prohibiting them would be a waste of time. Therefore, Driverless cars should not be prohibited because they are still dependent on people."
9374,0,"The ""human face"" on the Mars was not an alien creature, it was a natural lanform, created by the force of nature. Here are the reasons why the ""Face of human"" is not created by aliens. First, the ""human face"" 's shape changed when photography technology improved. Second, digital pictures showed that there was no living creatures or flying objects around the ""human face"". Third, mesaes were common on Mars. In 1976, people used film cameras to take pictures, these camera had low graphics, when you zoom in the pictures, the pictures becomes large pixels. But cameras nowadays have much smaller pixels, it allows us to take more detailed pictures. The ""human face"" was unclear in 1976, it only appeared as a human face shape. But in 2001, it becomes very clear, you can see the details on the ""human face"", the shadow of the eyes disappeared, the surface was full of scratches. The digital picture in 2001 gave scientist a lot space to work on the ""human face"". The scientists zoomed in the picture to find living creatures on the surface. The result was that there was nothing on the surface but dust. The ""human face"" is actually a mesa, it is unique because it was big. But there were a lot of mesaes on Mars, they had different sizes and shapes. The ""human face"" was the special one, its outline was formed by wind, luckily it became a human face. These mesaes are just like the lava dome in Snake River Plain of Idaho, they are both formed by natural force. With these three reasons, scientists are able to prove that the ""human face"" is not an alien creature, it is a natural landform."
1370,0,"Why we should study Venus despite the dangers of it? We should study Venus because it gives us a imformation about how it looks from the inside and outside of the planet, is it safe to live over there in the future, and also is the planet like earth. Since astronaunts have started studying Venus, they said that it is like earth despite the oxygen levels and some dangers of it. Spacecraft has been destroyed because of the atmosphere. They are some dangers of it and it is Earth-like. The text states, "" A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus."" This text is important because thats why spacecraft has been destroyed because of the levels of deadly carbon. Also, it is Earth like because Venus contains Mountains, Valleys, Oceans, and natural disasters such as storms and earthquakes. The text states, "" Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Furthermore, recall that Venus can cometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel."" This is important because it is the closest like earth. To conclude, Venus has some dangers of it like the atmosphere but it also contains earth-like features. In the future, maybe us as humans can live in Venus if earth get destoyed because Venus is survivable."
22348,0,"""America for the people, by the people"". Dear senators in which who favor keeping the Electoral College of the United States. Ask yourself this question ""if this country was made for the people, by the people, why aren't we allowed to vote for our own president""? The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. It's time for change. To begin with, the principles of America were made under the intention to create a country of equality. This electoral college has created a boundary between the people and it's government. Under the electoral college system, voters vote for not the president, but for a slate elector, who in turn elects the president. By this doing are voice aren't being heard. It's like giving a homeless person five-dollars, we don't know where are money is going. This system needs to be replaced by the popular vote, so that are voice could be heard. To continue, this system is extremely outdated. The fact that our founding fathers established it in the Constitution, as a comprimse between election of the president, is living proof how outdated this system is. This system runs like zombie after the crash of a 5 hours energy drink. Heck, this system is so old, my grandma remebers the day it was established, like it was yesterday. Although this rustbucket is old, the worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, and still not by the hands of ""the people"". We demand change! Although some may say, this systems prevents a bunch of yahoo's from voting. Everyone desevere their take on the subject of matter. There's an adge saying "" the one's you don't expects to learn from, can teach you the most"". After all it is our right to vote, as it is promise in the Constitution. The electoral system is an irrational system. It's basically like a slap in the face. A way of the government saying we're a bunch of dodo birds, that are incapable of voting. In conclusion, It's official, the electoral college is unfair, extremely outdated, and irrational. The world is changing around us and it's time to adapt. Instead of ""pointing guns at eachother"", we need to assemble. ""Give me freedom or give me death"". Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!"

The author supports the idea of taking the challenge to Venus by stating that the planet is worth studying for regardless of what dangers pursue them. Most astronauts from NASA are fascinated about the idea of the exploration of Venus. In article it says,"" Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it way well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" In addition, it also says,"" Some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" There are a lot of astronauts in NASA that are willing to take on the challenge to Venus and NASA has already been simulatiing prototypes to withstand the conditions similar to Venus. The planet is not just fascinating. it's also really dangerous for astronauts to travel there. Exploring Venus is really dangerous that no one will be able to survive with such harsh conditions the astronauts have to face. In the text it says, "" Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" In addition, the article also states, ""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun."" The conditions on that planet Venus are much worse than on Eath, the planet contains such heat that it is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. For conclusion, there are a lot of dangers and obstacles that the astronauts need to prepare for if the astronauts want to accomplish the challeneg to explore Venus. The author supports the idea of taking the challenge to Venus by stating that the planet is worth studying for regardless of what dangerspursue them."
3629,0,"Venus is a planet closest to Earth in ways of density and size and sometimes distance. The research done on this planet isn't much because of the dangers of studdying this plane, which has done more damage many unmanned spacecrafts during the tolls of the research of the sister planet. Yet there have been research done, the information that was gathered was on the ""rocky sediment and features such as valleys,mountains,and craters"" stated on paragraph 4, also stated on paragraph 3 it is stated that Venusian geology has taken to consider that it has erupting volcanoes,earthquakes, and lighting strikes,but as probes finding to land on Venus's surface. Not to mention how Venus has the hottest surface temperature even though Mercury is closer to the sun but venus takes it way more since it can reach about 800 degrees fahrenheit and the pressure is 90 times greater than earth. Even if we can make a spacecraft that can handle the force and enviromental of Venus. Will humans even survive even though it has earth like features? No since the planet has a thick atmosphere of 97 percent carbon dioxide and how corrosive sulfuric acid is in Venus's atmosphere. Now NASA has a idea of making a spacecraft that wont enter the stmosphere but also closes enough that we can research without losing any pilots during the time around Venus. this spacecraft will float above the planet and will look like a blimp like shape to it. As much as we want to reach this planet its gonna take some time when exploring the planet. Venus has one of the most complex sides to its way of life in there but soon enough NASA will have something to make its way and find out more about this planet. As much as NASA would have more tech to build all we have is the research we have now to look upon us now."

Also any aircrafts, small shacks, or airplains would be able to be seen in the picture due to the pixels in the camera. The camera would be able to see anything that goes on mars. All of the details that you see is just shadows from the rock That makes it look like it has eyes, a mouth, and a nose, and thats why the face is a natural land form and not made by alens."
1484,0,"There are many factors that makes Venus a very challenging planet for humans to study. Although Venus is the closest planet to Earth, there are many risks that have made it a very challenging place to examine more closely. Venus is the second planet from the sun which makes it very hard to achieve missions. All of the previous missions were unmanned because no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. In the article ""The Challenging of Exploring Venus,"" the author supports his claim that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by telling the reader about Venus's thick atmosphere, NASA's possible solution to Venus's hostile conditions, and all of the forms of light that it cannot penetrate. Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite a challenge it presents, like Venus's thick atmostphere. The planet's surface and the atmospheric pressure is much more greater than what people experience on Earth. The temperature is so much greater that it would crush a submarne. Paragraph 3 states, ""Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun."" There are too many risks from this planet being the hottest planet in the solar system, for people to explore it. It wouldn't be safe for people to experience this incredibly hot planet. Another challenge that studying Venus brings to the reader, is NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus. Vehicles would be hovering miles above the landscape to avoid the ground conditions by staying up and out of the way. Paragraph 5 states, ""At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth."" It could be very dangerous with people many miles above the surface, along with the termpature very high. Although it's survivable for humans, it's still very dangerous. Another challenge that studying Venus brings to the reader is all of the forms of light that it cannot penetrate. Since the light isn't penetrating the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography effectively, people only receive limited insite on ground conditions on Venus. People have to look at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet to even get a little bit of insight. Paragraph 6 says, ""Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks."" Since researchers can't take samples of things like gas, or rocks from a distance, they are working on innovations that would allow their machines to last long enought to help with their knowledge of Venus. Studying Venus has many challenges to go along with it. Although studying this planet is a worthy pursuit, some dangers were presented by telling the reader about Venus's thick atmosphere, NASA's possible solution to Venus's hostile conditions, and all of the forms of light that it cannot penetrate. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system which makes it hard for people to explore it if the pressure is so high. Vehicles hover miles above the landscape to avoid the ground conditions by staying up and out of the way. Since it's so hard to get close the Venus because of its risks, people have to look at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet to even get a little bit of insight. Although there are many dangers that come with exploring Venus, people get so much out of the result if researchers get to exploring what they needed to, to inform the rest of the people."

This artical explains what electoral colleges are, how they help voting, and how they are bad. These three things give the reader the opion about this artical. Source one ""What is the Electoral College Work? "" by the Office of the Federal Register explains what an electoral college is "" The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the president by vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens"". The founding fathers intended to help with elections but later people want it to go away so their votes matter. Since electoral colleges have been formed they have been disliked because they are thought of as ""an anachronism, and a non-democratic method of selecting a president"". Another is ""The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"". In most of the passage it talks about how the readers demise the electoral college. To sum up this passage the readers would agree electoral colleges are unwanted, and not need. This is supported by many quotes in all of the sources. The best quote to prove this point is "" Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people."
17609,0,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"", the author makes some very good points in both the positive and negative aspects. In my opinion, I think that it would not be a good idea to have a driverless car. A reason for this answer is because we cannot let technology take over our lives. We have been getting lazier over the years and we have technology running our lives. Yes, there are some great things about a driverless car like having vibrating seats when you are about to hit something or how we get notified when we need to do the driving. It's all great until we end up sitting back and relaxing to let things do our job. We need some control in our lives, not some technology running our lives for us. One other reason that I dont like the idea of driverless cars is that I'm a first time legal driver and I've been waiting for a long time to be able to drive. But if we end up with driverless cars all around, then anyone who's had their hopes set on learning how to drive, then they wont be able to do that anymore. Driverless cars take the fun out of doing that. They say in the article that ""We have to interpret the driving fun in a new way."" They say this and then they describe how they can make driverless cars fun. Some of the ways they named is by bringing in-car entertainment and all. But I feel like that would just be a destraction because if we get caught up in all the entertainment, and for some reason like manufacturing messed up he warning system or we couldn't hear the warning system, then we could potentially wreck or even worse, die. The article does talk about how they want it to be safe and all, but how can they be safe? Its all electronic and every electronic ends up failing at some point. Honestly, I'd rather not have driverless cars in the future, but if it ends up happening, I'll probably not use one unless I have to."
21382,0,"I think the Electoral college is a good way to vote for the president or vice president because i think without the Electoral college, we wouldn't have anyone to vote for the president or vice president. We have each candidate running for president in our state and it has his or her own group of electors. The electors are chosen by the candidate political party. I agree that most state have a winner take all system because it awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. The 23rd Amendment of the constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. The word state refers to the District of Columbia. The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. We help choose our state's electors when we vote for president because when we vote for our candidate we are actually voting for our candidate electors. I think the best laid defenses of the system are wrong because some voters might sometime vote for the wrong candidate and they might sometime get confused about the electors. After Al Gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral college, he won the popular vote but lost the presidency. Over 60 percent of voters would perfer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. The disaster factor is the single best argument against the electoral college. I agree that most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winner take all system in each state. Candidate don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning,focusing only on the tight races in the swing states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidate at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina,and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't see a single campaign ad. I agree that the it's official that the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best agruments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. The agruments against direct elections are spurious at best. It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right. Abolish the electoral college. I think the five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President was for its lack of democratic. The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. I disagree the advocates of this postition are correct in arguing that the Electoral college method is ot democratic in a modern sense. It is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When we vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors because we're not actually voting for the president, we're just voting for the slate of electors. Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed. However it it entirely possibe that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections inn which no candidate receives a majority of the vote cast. I agree that they made the five reasons for retaining the Electoral College."

But do you think cars are good for the enviroment do you think we should have them every where we go or just for important things like work. Well people are trying to solve that problem by inventing new cars like ''the eletric car'' or ''the solar power car'' but people dont have the money to buy those things. Or should we just not have cars for a day just like in BOGATA,Colombia where they did not use there car for a day and people around the city were walking and rideing bikes to work. i think there should be a day where America should not use cars and then we could see how people react to how they think of that and say if they liked it or not. Because people in America are buying less cars and are driving less and i think we should keep it that way. People in VAUBAN,Germany residents of a community are not useing cars and people like the idea there ''they think that its safer and they are less stressed'' you could have a car but it will cost u a fortune $40,000 just to get a car and a apartment with a garage to put the car in. But ''some people sold there cars just to live in that community'' but are happy there in the community there lives 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile. so wat i think we should do is use are car less and save the enviroment from pollution and start doing what contrys like VAUBAN,Germany or paris, and BOGATA,Colombia are doing makeing this world a better place."
12660,0,"There are many things good, and bad about driverless cars. Most people would argue that they are a safer and more reliable option. On the other hand, are they going to really make a difference? There are too many holes in the design and safety issues that the whole idea is pointless. The idea of a driverless car is phenomenal, it would prevent drunk drivers from driving, texters from texting and driving, and the handicap from needing a person with them to get somewhere. All of those things would benefit to the world, that is if the cars would actually be driverless. Manufacturer's would most likely be responsible for any accident, making them act very carefully while designing these cars. So far they have come up with the idea that a person still needs to be ready to take over when needed. This defeats the whole purpose. All too often people die or get seriously injured from a drunk driver. Young adults would be able to get in a car drunk, and get home safely. But what happens if the car decides it cant handle the situation? The only option would be for the drunken person to take over, still drunk. There would be no point in even using a driverless car at that point. A way for handicaped people to be transported without someone else needed would be very convenient. They could get out and do their shopping and make it to events without the help of a friend or family member. It could make them feel independent. But when it gets down to the point where they need to take over, some might not be able to. This could injure them more or put them in danger. With all the ups this idea could bring, it just doesnt make sense. With further experimentation and design, in the future we might be able to overcome these obstacle, but until then, driverless cars are not going to make a big change. For now we should stick to taxis and regular cars."
22029,0,"Dear Senator Rick Scott, I am writing to you today in regaurds to the Electoral College and whether or not we should continue to use it in our presidential election. As you know, the Electoral College was established by our founding fathers when they wrote the Constitutation. They established it as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and an election by popular vote of qualified citizens. I feel that we should get rid of the Electoral College and have a direct election by qualified United States citizens. One reason that I feel the United States should get rid of the Electoral College is because Congress can be easily swayed to vote a certain way in the election. One example of this would be because of lobbying. This process is where someone persuades a person to vote a certain way by bribing them with campaign funds or other monetary things. Where some may argue that the Congress should have a say in the election because they are chosen to be leaders in their states, I feel that because of some of the people that are allowed to be elected into Congress, the United States should leave it up to the rest of the population to elect the president. Another reason I feel this way is that through the electoral college, the population of a state votes on an elector who in turn elects the president. This is not fair because if you are a republican, you do not want the democratic president to win the popular vote. This means that if you are in a mostly democratic state, the elector for the state that you live in will most likely choose the democratic president that you voted against just because that is what some of the other people in your state wanted. This would be the same for a democrat living in a mostly republican state. It is because of these reasons that it is in my humble opinion that the United States should get rid of the Electoral Congress and have a direct vote of qualified citizens.

21500,0,"Cars have been the main use for transportatation from one distant destination to another. The population is relying on cars more often to get them to were they need to be. Everyone in the communities are becoming lazier and cannot bother to grab a bike or even a pair of skates to help them get where they need to go. More and more of the population do not want to walk to the store which is usually down the street. Cars have even been polluting the atmosphere causing numerous issues, such as health problems and even a rise in the temperature of the planet. The purpose of this essay is to inform fellow citizens of the advantages of limiting car usage. By limiting the amount of cars we have in the country or even by reducing the days one can use their car, can dramatically reduce the pollution in the atmosphere and also cause citizens to become more active and healthy. ""Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders.""(Source 1, Paragraph 2). Vauban is one community to begin their journey to becoming a car reduced area. ""As a result, seventy percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and fifty-seven percent sold a car to move here.""(Source 1, paragraph 3). As said by one of the residents, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heindrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.""(Source 1, paragraph 3). Paris is another city to take on the challenge of limiting the use of cars. Paris is a city where there is an abundance od smog and pollution. ""After days of near-record pollution Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" (Source 2, paragraph 10). Because of such effort, ""Congestion was down sixty percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog...""(Source 2, paragraph 14). By limiting car usage citizens have only one option, to get up find a bike or running shoes and set out for the day. By doing this the peoples can become very healtthy and reduce the chances of life treatening illnesses, such as cancer and others such as diabetes and lung and heart problems. Just think of the environment, by using less cars we can lower of even completely stop the effects of global warming which can lower the the rising of the sea and help to stop the destruction of the ozone. ""BOGOTA, Colombia-In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or even took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of trafic jams.""(Source 3, paragraph 20). These simple and energizing activities can get you to where you need to be and also gets and keep you active and moving. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.""(Source 3, paragraph 24). ""Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift, "" said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center.""(Source 4, paragraph 35). The world is changing and with it the health of the people and the condition of the environment. By taking time from using motor vehicles we can lower the pollution of the world and improve the health of the people who live in it. By lowering the production of cars, citizens will have no choice but to grab their bikes or skates or even running shoes and begin to move. The time is now for the community to change. Many different cities have already started their change with cars and now is the time for you to join in the movement. One step at a time."

Just type in the address of the place you want to go and you're on your way, with no use of your hands. That is until something such as a road block, or construction work comes up. There are many safety concerns with a driverless car. When someone says ""driverless"" you automatically think you don't have to do anything. When you're on the road, what if a sensor happens to stop working, and you don't know. You could cause a really bad accident, or even kill someone. Would it be your fault, or the cars fault? There's so many questions, and concerns about safety here, is it worth all the risks you'd take on a daily basis just to go to work, or even just to lunch? Not only could you hurt yourself in this car, you could potentially hurt other people as well. While in any kind of car, you could run into many different things. Animals crossing the street, kids playing, even tree branches after a bad storm. When you run into these things, you know what to do, and how to avoid anything bad happening, but does your smart car? Something could happen on the car, a sensor could get scrached, a camera could go out, then the car wouldn't know what to do or where to go and that puts you, others in the car, and others outside of the vehicle in danger. Smart car or not, humans will always have control. When you approach something in the road you will always have to take over. If a sensor messes up you'll have to take over, if it takes a wrong turn, you'll have to take over, if it doesn't sense something in the road, you'll have to take over. The car will never be fully driverless, they'll always have to have a driver if it malfunctions. What if something does happen, who's to blame? The person driving, or the manufacturer? Plus what's the fun of not being able to drive? You've been wanting to drive since you can remember, and all of a sudden there's this new driverless car where you don't have to do anything until something bad happens? That's no fun. Cars are great, they get you places quickly. The future is here, but do we really wanna put people in danger so we can say that the future is here? We should just stick to cars with drivers, so no one gets hurt, we don't have to tear out roads up, we don't have to worry about fixing expensive things on our cars, and we know everyone's safe."

14579,0,"Have you ever wondered what the face on the moon actually is? It is a huge rock formation. The rock formation certianly looks like a face, but this does not mean that there is life on Mars. The rock formation has been brought very much attention. The attention has people asking if the face is evidence for life on Mars or just a natural formaion. As said in the article, ""Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" This tells us that the defenders of the NASA budget tells you that if NASA found life on Mars; they would most likely tell it. ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform."" This sentence is telling us that a web surfer found the image of the face to be a natural formation. Both of these support my claim of the face being a natural formation. Evidence that supports my claims are in the article. ""There was no alien monument after all."" ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform."" ""Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" NASA also unveiled an image for the people to see and it was captioned, ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" When some people keep saying that it looks like a face; it sure does, but it is not one. The ""Face on Mars"" is nothing more than a natural rock formation. The rock formaiton doesnt show any evidence for life and if it did, NASA would tell everyone. When someone is reading things from magazines, the internet, etc, it does not mean they are always going to be true. People need to not blindly trust the internet, magazine, etc, they need to do more research. The face is a natural rock formation. It has had lots of questions raised about what it is, but we have figured out now that it is a rock formation. This is no evidence for life on Mars, we still have yet to find that. NASA has let us with the truth of what the face actaully is. The face we see on Mars is a rock formation; now kids know the truth about what it truly is and now so do you."

The diverless cars are smart in many ways that normal cars aren't. They are not completely driverless but the are very close. The diverless cars are a wise choice for the future. The Diverless cars have many cool gadget that makes the car safer. The car comes with a Spinning sensor on the roof which is laser beams constantly updating 3D model of the car surroundings. The diverless car also has a video camera on the rear view mirror that is always watching the diver, to insure that they are always paying attention. The car also has 4 atomotive sensors, and a GPS recevier. As you can see all of these things make the car safe and easy. These cars are not completley driverless, they do need human skills in some senarios, such as when the car approches a car accedent it would need the driver to drive through it. If this were to happen then the car would vibrte the drivers seat to warn them that there is a dangerous situation and they need to intervine. Other than that the car can do many things it can steeer its self, accelerate, and brake with no human help required. The diverless cars are not legal everywhere yet. Due to the cars not being completely developed yet, auto makers are still solving problems with the car. The automakers belive that the car will be on autopilot 90% of the time. Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and nissan predict that the cars will drive themselces by 2020."
6855,0,"As our human society progresses, it's easy to become ignorant and fearful of the things you don't yet understand. Every day we advance and take steps forward on a technological front, and to favor the betterment of our society is to favor the innovations that our contemporaries spearfront. With this being said, Prof. Thomas Huang's Facial Action Coding System is a valuable tool that can help us better understand our peers in a classroom setting through it's intricate facial emotion detection algorithim. Simply looking into how the system works will demonstrate the intricacy and technicality executed in order to obtain the most accurate results. ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry,"" says the introductory sentence to Nick D'Alto's article, ""Making Monsa Lisa Smile."" The FACS algorithim was used on Da Vinci's Mona Lisa and was able to detect subtlties of muscle movements down to the exact percentages of the emotions felt. Given the deep analytical nature of the system, it's safe to say that this information is that of an accurate program. Having accurate information is one thing, but how does this algorithim propose itself as a practical tool for every day use in a classroom environment? Well, if we take into account the many students that arrive each day, all with their own individual needs and concerns; it can get rather hectic when trying to confront all of these things at once. The Facial Action Coding System could allow for objective analysis of how students are feeling, and the appropriate personal action from another human could be decided from there. ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" states Huang; so this would eliminate the possibility of any sort of subjective analysis of the emotions themself. Lastly, I believe that this would greatly improve the efficiency and general wellbeing of our students. Stress due to school is truly a nationwide epidemic, and the signs of these issues go unnoticed more often than not. With this technology in place, it would help students who may perhaps undermine their feelings or who are too passive to speak up for themselves. With these problems tackled, school could be both more productive, and enjoyable. With all of this considered, I believe that it would be in the best interest of everyone who attends class regularly to implement this new innovation. As humans, we have a responsibility to change as society advances. As the technology progresses, we owe it to ourselves to ensure that we're doing the same."

The conspiricy that it was created by aliens, is false, there is no living source on the planet Mars, if there was we would have found it by now. The conspiricy about aliens creating the Face on the planet Mars is false, there are no aliens on mars. We have placed land rovers and even a survey spacecraft ad we have yet to see any sign of a life source. Even though Mars has a similar atmosphere to Earth and has some water, the living conditions are to horrible for something to survive on the planet. Even if the do have water, what is thier shelter and what do they eat? Exactly nothing, there is nothing on mars to make a shelter or and there is nothing you could eat to survive. Mars is just a big giant ball of red dust and nothing more then that. Even though the Face on Mars was created naturally, it has become a pop icon. It has appeared in movies, books, magizines, radio-talk shows and even haunted grocery store check out lines. Some scientest belive that the Face is a n alien artifact, on April 4, 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time in years. Micheal Malin and his team snapped a picture ten times sharper then the original Viking photos. Still people were not statisfied and in the winter they sent another camera out to capture a picture, but there was a problem, they had to peer through wispy clouds, which made it difficult to see, some even said hidden in the haze were hidden alien markings. They tried onece more on April 8, 2001, a cloudless day in Cydonia, the Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. Malins team campyures an extraordinary ohoto using the camera's maximum revolution. What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mess, a landform that is common in Western America. So see the Face was not created by aliens, just by the enviorment. Sometimes conspirecys are true but this one was false."
22597,0,"The electrol college system is an unfair system, people don't have the right to select their own president, they dont have the right to select a president. Because, when people vote they are technically voting for the electors for a candited. That candidate can be a democratic or a republican. In source two it states that electors can choose there opposing candidate. Which declines the the whole voting process. Why do we vote? we vote to select a leader who will defend this coutry and make america a place of oppurtunity. The most important reason why the electrol cllege is unfair because of the "" winners it take all"" rule. We as american people cannot choose their own goverment, as it says in source two, that when voters vote they are voting for the canditates electors. Each state gets one vote and then the electors can choose who they want for president. In source two it states that the electoral college consists of 538 electors and the most amont of elecrtoral votes is 270, in order to pick an president. Also in source two it states that the number of electors we have equals to the amount of members of congress we have. I propose a new system by only letting the American people select our president by votes counted all up by each state, for example if we didn't have have electoral college, then it would be a fair vote because people votes would count the number that adds up with all votes for one candidates that will oppose another candidates and there would be technically no tie it would either,more or less, but if we still had the electoral college then the vote would not be equally fair becuse if the majority of a state for examlpe chose republican candidate, then that would be vague becuse some people choose democratic and there vote did not really count. but without the electoral collge, than everyones vote counts and each candidates gets vote from every one, not only electoral. In source two it says that electorals who have been select by the state can choose their opposing candidtade, which is more disatvantgeing to the american people and america's future. for example if one state candidate was choosen for republican and they were ""faithless"" as it says in source two, and chose the democratic party it would be very unfortunate for the republicans because than there would be no point of the votes the republican supporters have voted for. It only comes once every four years, this is very important to the american people, on choosing who they want for the future of america. In source two and three it states the rule "" winner take it all"". The votes the other lose the, winning can take it all, that vote that they take from the losing does not count Because the people really didnt mean to vote for the candidate they don't want or the candidate they dont support, its like your money fell on the floor and someone just took it knowing its yours. In conclusion, the state senators should eliminate the electoral collge because they count the majorty votes, and don't count other votes that is not popular as the other candidates vote. also because they can decide vote on an canditate they want based on their opinions and beliefs. and lastly because of the winner takes it all system which is bascially taking the losing candidates electoral votes."
14337,0,"The Face is a natural landform because new high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey reveals that the Face on Mars is really a mesa. It's a natural landform because on April 5th, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor snapped a picture ten times better than the original Viking photos and it turned out to be exactly what they said it would be: a natural landform. The reasons that it's a natural landform are that on April 8th, 2001, a cloudless summer day on Mars, Malin's team in the Mars Global Durveyor captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's maximum resolution. Also, the pixel technology in 2001 allowed them to see things as small as airplanes on the ground, Egyptian-style pyramids, even small shacks! Last, but not least, the picture actually shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. I believe this because Garvin says that the Martian landform reminds him most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. He also informs us that it's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."
21093,0,"Dear Mr. Senator, The electoral college is a terrible way to vote for the president. It's not fair to the people and there's always the chance of the disaster factor! First off, the electoral college is unfair to the people. It's like your actual vote doesn't matter, because in reality your just voting for another voter. For example when a president wins the popular vote, it doesn't matter! So the peoples real opinion means nothing. Because the only thing that counts is actually who wins over the electoral college. So who knows how many people there are who voted for the president that lost the electoral college's votes but won the popular how outraged they must be! In article 2 they have a really good point ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.""(p14) Which basically means that to the people the electoral college doesnt make much sense, and there vote doesn't exactly even count. This is only one reason that the electoral college needs to be thrown out! Second of all, the electoral college always has the chance of the disaster factor. When the states voter doesn't vote for who his is supposed to! Or when the state replaces the voter with someone who will do just that. In article 2 they have a great example ""Back in 1960 segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.)""(p11) So the disaster factor is always a potential threat which is why the electoral college should be abolished! To conclude, the electoral college needs to be abolished because there is always the chance of the disaster factor, and it's unfair to the people it's like their vote doesn't even matter!"

Venus is often refured to as ""Earth's Twin"", And is also the closest planet to the earth in terms of density and size. There is evidence that is shown that each previous mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, because no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Lots of factors contribute to venus's reputation as a Challenging Planet for human to study. Some of the dangers of Venus are the planet has a very thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets. The most challenging are the clouds of highly corrosice sulfuric acid in the planets atmosphere. The temperatures on venus average over 800 degree's Fahrenheit and the atmosphereic pressure is 90 times greater than what humans experiance on Earth. Venus also has the hottest suface temperature of any planet in our solar system.

5301,0,"Could you ever imagine being in class and actually being genuinely interested or entertained? I know I couldn't. However, it might just be possible for the teacher to read you emotions and adjust the lesson for you. I am going to give you two reasons why I believe that using technology to read emotional expression of students in a classroom is highly valuable. One reason this is valuable is so students do not get bored. One of the things that makes school not so fun for kinds is how uniteresting the lesson is. In paragraph 6 of an article tited ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" Dr, Huangs says "" A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor."" With this technology you would never have to worry about another super boring lesson. Another reason why this is valueable technology for classroom use is because teachers can see how the student is feeling about the lesson. In paragraph 6, it also states "" Imagine a computer knows when you're happy or sad. For example, if you smile when a web as appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if your frown, the next ad will be different."" This could also be applied to a teacher. If the teacher sees that the lesson is making the students happy they can go on teaching the way they are teaching. Now, I have given you two reasons why using technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. This technology will definetly bring up the grades of students if they are throuroughly intertained, interested, and happy with what they are learning."
19240,0,"It is hard to imagine a world without cars being controlled without humans. Cars have been a mandatory factor in most of our everyday lives. If we as humans decide to cut out the human factor to driving, there are consequences. Consequences such as the threat of saftey, the lost jobs surrounded around vehicles, and the overall question; are self-driving cars nessecary? Not very long ago, I like many before me, got my liscense at the age of sixteen. That day will forever linger in my mind everytime I put the keys in the ignition. As a young driver, my saftey is always a concern. I learned the true aspects of saftey in my drivers education course, and saftey has been stuck in my mind since. If we create a world where us as humans are no longer in control of saftey, are we not creating an unsafe world? I am expected to put my life in the hands of some machine, rather than putting life in my own hands. Several years ago, the auto industry was a major factor for income for most people. The jobs surrounded by cars have always been imparative for humans. Then, machines took over the jobs humans had lived off of. Making the auto industry more efficient, but leaving many without jobs. Now we are faced with a similar situation, where the driverless cars take jobs from people who live off of driving. The auto industry has been relatively the same over the past few years. Cars have become safer, faster, and all around more productive. Now comes the change of a lifetime, the change nobody really needed. Sure, self-driving cars make life easier for everyday life. But, sometimes we need to take a few steps back and remember; how far is too far? The auto industry does not require this change. Negativity is all that comes from this change. The auto industry will not benefit from these self-driving cars. They will create lawsuits and disaster. These driverless abominations will make the living jobless. This audacious movement will create an unneed and irrational situation for us, the people."

5687,0,"This essay states some very good points on how maybe computers can tell how you feel but, I do not think that there is any value in using technology to read students emotional expressions. Yes, the article states ""nine percent disgusted, six percent fearful, and two percent angry"" which could be somewhat accurate but you can't tell how the person is feeling inside. The article says that making a smile or a happy face could make you happy, but many people become more unhappy the longer they pretend to be happy. I do not believe that the reason we become happy or sad while watching a film is because of the actors facial expressions. Yes, it helps us understand what is going on in the film, but it is not what gets us so ""into it"". The article also says that a classroom computer can detect whether you are bored or confused, but what if the student was just thinking about chores they have to do once they get home, or what's for lunch. You can't one hundered percent know how a person feels just by looking at their face. There are so many people that are happy, and are having a great day that just look angry. Lastly, I'm sure the experiments described in this essay could be correct to some degree. Some people may be actually happy or mad, and the computer could detect that, but I do not believe that it could be correct one hundered percent of the time. Da Vinci has nothing to do with technology we have today, he made beautiful artwork that we admire today. So in conclusion, I do not believe the information in this passage is fully correct. There is a lot of information and percentages that seem knowledgeable, but i do not agree with it. I could go to one of these computers, and I am pretty sure that it would not accurately show my emotions. Teachers don't need to try to know how every student feels at all times, so no, this technology is not valueable."

I am for the continuation of research and developement of driveless cars, pushing towards the future of transportation! According to the article ""Driveless Cars Are coming,"" Google cofounder Sergy Brin, forsees cars that will use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus. I believe driveless cars are the perfect, and realistic sollution for a cleaner and safer vehicle. The concept of driveless cars has been around for more than fifty years, according to the article ""Driveless Cars Are coming,"" in paragraph 3, General motors tried the concept of smarter roads in the late 1950's. According to the article ""Driveless Cars Are coming,"" in paragraph 5, ""In the 1980's automakers used speed sensors tot the wheels in the creation of antilock brakes"". Also according to the text ""Further improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks of their own."" Recently in 2009 Google developed cars that have driven more than half a million miles without a crash!, according to the first paragraph. We live in a society that revolves around computers, and the advancement of technology. Driveless cars realistically seems like the next step for our quickly advancing world. Driveless cars are safer, using GPS recievers, internal motion sensors, among other cool scientific advancements, making it necessary for the driveless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel. This allows for a much more personal, and safer driving experience. According to paragraph 7, ""Manufactures are also considering using cameras to watch that the drivers are remaining focused on the road. While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver."" This allows for a safer drive, preventing accidents, and improving a drivers skills. The driveless cars would have antilock breaks, allowing for a far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone. Driveless cars seem like the the perfect, and realistic sollution for a cleaner and safer vehicle. Our society will be forever changed by this advancement in technology of vehicles! I believe driveless cars are a great idea, that more people should be open to. Let the future of driving begin, with driveless cars!"

The cars would have amazing technolgy, keeping us safer from human errors, because, let's face it, humans aren't perfect. We could take better care of our planet. And, no one would need to pay for another car, again. The first reason we should have driverless cars, is because it is better for the planet. Google cofounder believes we could use driverless cars that would use half the fuel we use today. This would save fuel for future generations to come. Since we wouldn't be using as much fuel, there wouldn't be any concern of global warming. Think about your kids, your kids' kids, and so on. Do you want your grandkids to be suffering without any power source, or not even having a stable planet? No one wants that. Not only would driverless cars save our planet, they can help save lives. Another reason we should have driverless cars, is because they can help save many human lives. These driverless cars would be computers, they can communicate to other driverless cars. And also, computers are perfect, they don't make mistakes. Humans, on the other hand, are not perfect. We make mistakes, it happens. So when a computer is driving a car, it would not make the mistakes humans do, therefore, saving hundreds of thousands of lives each year. These driverless cars would help save some money, as well. The third reason we should have driverless cars, is because they would save a lot of money. No one would have to go out and fork out thousand of dollars on some new car. They could just use these driverless cars to transport them. Also, no one would have to pay for wrecks or insurance money, because these driverless cars wouldn't make mistakes to get them into car wrecks.

20939,0,"I think we should keep the Electoral College because i think it is fair majority rules one person has just as much chance as winning the votes as another. The electoral College will help with votes because the people that don't vote the person that gets the electoral votes still get the same amount of votes even if some people didn't vote at all it won't change. But if it was by popular vote then the people that don't vote will make a big impact because you will need more votes to win the election. I also see it as unfair because the people that voted for one person and the majority is for another person their votes won't have any affect and will be pointless. All the people that vote for one person are useless if the other person wins the majority. With the Electoral College some electors could defy the will of the people and vote for the opposite of what most people voted for. Say the 35 million people in california and 15,000,001 million people vote for one person and 14,999,999 people vote for the other those 14 million peoples votes are pointless with the electoral college and its not fair that the canidate doesn't even get one of those votes. In conclusion i say just get rid of the electoral college because of all the votes that won't count and all the people that voted and not a single one of their votes goes to who they voted for. If it was by popular vote one person could get majority of the electoral votes but less of the popular votes and if there was no electoral college some of the presidents might not have been president."

NASA has one particularly comeplling idea for sending humas to study venus. NASA's posiible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientist to float above the fray... the humas can stay in venus? the solar power would be plentiful \, and radiation would not exceed earth levels. not easy conditions, but survivable for humas striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value, not only because of the insight t be gained on the planet itself, but also because hman curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. our travels on earth and beyound should not be limit by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovations."
12541,0,"Driverless cars should not be able to be developed and used. They aren't safe because you do not know when they'll mess up. Also because if the technology fails, and a serious car crash happens there is nobody to blame. I know that driverless cars are improving, but there are just some obstacles that they aren't good enough for, like driving fast on the highway and switching lanes when needed. Also because driverless cars still haven't developed to where they can detour around things like work zones and car crashes. If driverless cars were to be allowed on the roads of the united staes it would not be good at all. This is because, in the United States, there are already too many cases where people are getting jailed for killing someone because of drunk driving, or driving under the influence. So if driverless cars were allowed on the streets people who are breaking the law, and driving under the influence will not be able to take over control of the car when a situation pops up where they are needed to manually drive. So therefore if a crash happens and someone got hurt who is there to blame, the manufactuers or the person in the drivers seat. Another reason that driverless cars shouldn't be able to hit the streets is because these cars are not able to perform things that humans can do. For example, when a human is driving down the street they look ahead for things they have to watch out for like, potholes, speedbumps, roadkill, and glass. These cars will not be able to do things like this because they are built to a specific system to where they just know where they are going, and how to stop and stuff. So therefore they will just run over these things. If they just run over things like glass, and potholes objects like the tires on the car may be damged. If the tires get damgaed that means they'll have to be replaced. And replacing the tires on a driverless car may be really expensive. So my point is that accepting driverless cars in the united states is not a good idea. Simply because they're too many things that may happen to the car. And also there are too many risks that may apply when having this car on the road."

As they were taking pictures around Mars they were shocked to see a face on one of the pictures. Scientists didn't take to much consideration aout the face. Thye thought it was just another Martian mesa. A few days later they released the picture of the face to the world. Since they released the photo it has become a pop icon. It was showed in Hollywood films, books, magazines, and in radio talks. Some people think it the Face is bona flide evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. The people thought they were hiding the fact that life may be on Mars. On April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera took some photos that were ten times sharper then the ones in 1976. As Michael Malin was taking photos, the world was anxious to see what would be the outcome of the photos. When the photos came out on a website it showed a landform. There was really no alien monument after all. The Face of Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998. It was a cloudy time of year on the Red planet. Not everyone was satisfied that it was just a landform. Some people say that the alien markings were hidden by all the haze. NASA decided to look aagain at Cydonia in 2001. On April 8, 2001, a cloudless summer day in Cydonia- Mars Global Surveyor went to take another look at the landform. During that little exibition, Malin's team captured an extraordianry photo using the camera's maximun resolution. Each pixel in 2001 spans 1.5 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. They compared the three photos and came to conclusion that the picture shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, common landforms around the American West. Garvin said it reminds him most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa, about the same height as the Face on Mars. Some people are dissapointed that it wasn't a alien artifact, but people still have there hopes that it possibly could be one."
3565,0,"The conflict of whether or not scientists should study the planet Venus has been up in the air, no pun intended, for sometime now. Many individuals think that studying Venus up close is too dangerous, whereas others disagree and think risks should be made. In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author thinks studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers, but does not support this idea very well. The author describes the potential dangers that could result from studying Venus which contradicts their idea that the observations made through studying Venus overweigh the risks. The author is aware of the fact and describes how, ""no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours"" (paragraph 2). Right off the bat, the author gives their audience the mindset that it is not a good idea to study Venus. Having that fact in the first few paragraphs of the article sets the tone for the rest of the article. In paragraph three, the author goes into great detail about several of the potential dangers that can come from studying Venus because of its, ""clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid"" (paragraph 3). The frightening environment described strays the audience even further away from believing that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. Not only does the author describe why dangers are present on the planet Venus, but they also gives analogies in regards to the danger present including the fact that, ""such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans"" (paragraph 3). At this point in the article, the idea of having a human explore and study Venus up close in unthinkable. The author tries to justify the dangers by explaining technology that will be used in order to allow individuals to study Venus. The author describes, ""a vehicle hovering over Venus"" (paragraph 5). At first, the technological advances that could be made sound like a good idea, but the author goes on to say how, ""tempertaures would still be toasty at around 170 degress Fahrenheit"" (paragraph 5). This fact completely shuts down the idea of the hovering vehicle. The author contradicts their ideas by explaining the dangers in depth and giving reason as to why studying Venus is not a good idea. From the very first descriptions of the idea the author is trying to bring across, the audience is turned away from the author's opinion. The tone set sways the audience toward one direction of the conflict while the author is in the other direction. The author went too far into detail about the dangers that can come from studying Venus and di not have evidence of how it would be safe and possible at all. The author's idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers was not supported through their ideas or evidence."

The thing they don't know is that when you use a car alot of thing can happen like you can get in accidet or the smoke that the car has is bad to breath on if someone is walk but in VAUBAN,Germany they dont have that proble because 70 percent of vauban's families do not own cars,and 57 percent sold a car to move there. Street parkig,driveways and home garages are forbidden on the outskirts of freiburd that near the French and Swiss borders. You probaly won't see a car in Vauban's streets because they are completely ""car free"" but If some that lives in VAUBAN that owns a car ownership is allowed,but there are only two places that you can park a large garages at the edge of the development,where a car owner buys a space but it not cheap to buy one they sell the space for you car for $40,000 along with a home. The vauban people completed this in 2006,they said that this an example of a growing trend in Europe,The untile states and some where else are suburban life from auto use this is called ""smart planning"". The current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailes the passengee cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car intensive in the United States. I honeslty think that good idea that they did that is Vaudan because that makes cities denser and better for walking and in VAUBAN there are 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile. In the artical David Gold berg said that ""All of our development since World war 2 has been centered on the cars,and that will have to change"" and i think that was very true what David Gold said because alot thing we need cars to do we can go anyway were with out cars beacuse some people are a very lazy to walk to place thats why they alot of people use car and i think that it was a good idea that that they did that in VAUBAN so people can see how we really don't need car to go to place from place because we can walk from were we need to go or we can ride bycles with out the use of a car. It good that they are doing that if you thik about your help the earth in way and thats a very good thing to. In the United states,the Environmental protection Agency is promoting what is called ""car reduced""communtunties,and the legislators are starting to act,if cautiously. Maany experts expect pubic transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six years federal transportation bill to approved this year. In previous bill,80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transports. There many good reason why they should do this."
9011,0,The art of technology to read expression would be valuable for many reasons. Many people like to guss or are unaware of peoles feelings which could cause problem with communication. It alsp could stop some problemd not all but some. With technology being that advanced to tell peoples felling it could defuse problems or keep them from happining. If someone is feeling sad or depressed and they are read from the computer it could tell a teacher to go help the kid out. By helping the kid or person it could keep tjat person from makig bad decisons. It could help out long term for those students. It could also help a teacher find out how to teach a specific subject the way thsts most beneficial to students. The computer reading emotions could help with that by letting the teacher know a kid is confused about something. A lot of time kids or people in generall don't like to ask for help about some things because it can be imbarrasing or they are just independent people but if they need help and dont ask the system could pick that up and inform the teacher. It could also make learning morre eifficant and interesting. Most people would want to know about how teachers are able to read emotions.

The Elcectoral Collage consits of 538 electors and only about 270 electoral votes are required to elect a president. I am in favor of keeping the Elcetoral Collage because the population is biased,and the population isnt always as smart as the people of the Electoral Collage and might not look at their criteria and stats and what quality's they have that make them a good presedent. The Elcectoral Collage is made up of 538 elecrtorsthat are suposed to be non biased unlike the public who are very biased in ways that come down to voting for a president because of his skin color. If all of our presedints were voted in because of the race or religion we would wouldknow longer have a country, we would live in segrigation and poverty and would hve 99 cent stores. Making a desion is some times very easie and some times very hard and most dissions are thought hard. While making a dessision on who to vote for afuture predident should take time but thats not always what happens. The public might not always take their time and look ovwr the facts and statistics on the future president and if we dint have the electoral collage we would have terrible presidents most of the time. Inconclusion the Elcetoral collage is verry important, and we need it because the public isnt always wright even they think they are and it could have possibly saved our countries if the non elected runners for presedint would have bean president and it it possibly could have enden sufering and bad thing in out county but the Electoral Collage isnt always a good thing but its deeply needed"
8475,0,"The Facial Action Coding System wouldn't be valuable in a classroom. Technology could only do so much to help us. A student could be sleeping and it may convey that as an emotion. A computer reading a student's emotion won't make learning easier if it changes the lesson up. Facial expressions are universal, they vary from person to person. Not every peson may have the same emotion as the previous one. On top of that, remembering every facial expression may take up a lot of files. It can also be possible that the computer may not be able to detect certain expressions. Some people features are much more noticable than others. This too plays a key role in FACS. FACS may not always be accurate. A person can be genuinely happy, but the computer may detect something is wrong. Computers shouldn't have to do everything because they can make mistakes. In the passage, Dr. Huang states that ""His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code."" This may not work so well as it can glitch up and get confused with other codes. In conclusion,technology that can read student's expressions aren't valuable. Facial expressions vary, FACS may not be accurate, and there could be a glitch."

11539,0,"Driverless cars are the future of driving. It is an inevitable fact, people are already spending countless hours trying to figure out how to make cars safe and driverless, and have made some cars that are nearly driverless. I think that driverless cars are a bad idea. These cars will just help fuel americas lazy lifestyle. Having cars the drive themselves will take all of the fun out of driving. I think that driving is a lot of fun and if we take away peoples ability to drive then we will miss out on a lot of fun and skills that can help in everyday life. Automatic cars are not safe, if there is an accident on the road or constuction or anything blocking the road then the automatic cars will need the assistance of human drivers. The cars that are being produced now are not even fully automatic. There are some car manufactoring companies that have already made cars that are almost driverless and have been working on making driverless cars for years and years. Some of these companies include General Motors, google (using a Toyota Prius), BMW, Tesla, Mercedes Benz, Audi, and Nissan have all either come out with a car that is almost driverless or has released plans to release them, Tesla in 2016 and the others in 2020. These manufacturing companies have already started making automatic cars and have been working on them for a very long time. I think that if the companies keep working and progressing on the safety issues with the automatic vehicles then maybe these automatic cars can be a good thing. The American lifestyle, some might say that it is hardworking and free, others howeveer might say that we are lazy. I have to agree with both, we have many citizens that are very hardworking and strive to do their best and improve themselves and others. Sadly that is not all of out citizens, we have a gigantic amount of people in our contry that are lazy, they do not want to work for anything, and expect everything in life to be given to them without them putting forth any more effors than applying for some things online. If the automobile manufactorers release a car that drives itself, that will just be one more thing that the lazy americans do not have to do. It would be another thing just handed to them that they would not have to work for. These cars are made by the hardworking to make life for the lazy easier. I do not think that this is something that needs to happen or something that should even be considered. When I get in my car and just drive, it is always fun. The feeling of being free and being able to go wherever you want and just to be able to drive is amazing. I think that many people love to drive and if we made automatic cars the manual cars would start to dissappear. Making many people upset and many others miss out of the wonders of driving. Diving a car can help build and develop many skills that can be helpful in every day life and even at work. Driving can help you develop your reflexes and your ability to spot details and be somewhat predictive of what others might do. That can help with plenty of jobs including sports. Learning to drive a car is one of the memories that you will remeber forever. If we have automatic cars then we will miss out on those memories. Automatic cars will not be safe. These automatic cars can not handle anything besides normal road conditions or even pulling in and out of driveways. ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents"" (Driverless cars are coming, author unknown). These cars have been built to alert the driver when they need to take over the vehicle, but are still not capable of functioning without a human driver, which could be a safety hazards. If the vehicle is not able to handle the road conditions ahead it will attemp to notify the driver inside, but considering it is an automatic vehicle the driver may have fallen asleep due to the lack of entertainment of activities to keep them alert and then the car nor the driver is able to manuver the obsticles ahead and the could cause an accident resluting in the death of anyone involved. Driverless cars are coming, and they are going to be dangerous. Driverless cars are coming and they stilll have a lot of issues to work through that could be dangerous. Driverless cars are going to reward the lazy for being lazy, and make them have to do even less work. Taking away the need for human drivers in vehicles will take away great memories, fun adventures, and many valuable skills that peple can gain while driving a car. These cars also can cause many safety issues including accidents from the lack od the cars ability to handle certain situations and could also cause issues if the drivers of these cars fall alseep when there is a sitiuation where there is a need for a human driver. RIght now these cars do not have enough safety features and they do not have enough driving capability to be safe for public use. If the manufactoring companies continue to work on these cars and make improvements, then these cars might not be completely bad, but as of right now they are not safe enough or skillled enought to be sent out to the pubic."
6447,0,"Boredom in the classroom is not rare. For many students, some lessons will be pretty boring and bland, making the the student less attentive and engaged. What if that can be changed with technology? What if the machine used to detect emotions in Da Vinci's artwork, the Mona Lisa, could be used to the students' benefits? The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it can detect the students' emotions during the lesson, it can modify the lesson according to their emotions, and it is much more effective compared to a human. This technology could be used to detect the students' emotions during the lesson. In the article in paragraph 4, ""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks the facial movements-in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa.... Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion)."" The author describes here how the machine works. It detects the muscles and the movements of s face and compares it to a neutral (no emotions) face in order to determine the emotion of the subject, whether it be a painting of a real life human. Using this device, the computer can be placed in a classroom and can be used to detect the students' emotions. This means as a teacher, they will know whether their lesson is making the students happy, sad, or angry. Using this new data that can be collected, it can make the students more engaged. With the new data collected, this device can help make the students much more engaged in their learning by modifying the lesson according to emotions. As stated in paragraph 6, ""Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad. For example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" As described by the author, this technology could be used to make the marketing buisiness much more succesful. They can play more ads that are similar to the ones that made the viewer happy and play different ones if the viewer seemed to be unhappy. This concept can be taken and implemented into a classroom. The computer can use the emotion detecting data and modify the lesson to where it will be towards the students' liking. With this device, it will be much easier to understand the students and make the classroom more enjoyable. It can even introduce a new system of learning. This device can provide a much better substitute for a teacher. In paragraph 5, ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that converys happy, worried, etc.... His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electric code."" The author describes how humans make this same ""calculation"" every single day since we can sometimes identify when a friend is sad or happy. However, humans are not as good at calculating emotions as this device is. Humans could have trouble determining facial traits that convey specific emotions, which is why the device is much more effective. This new device that can provide a much better learning experience with modified lessons can even replace human teachers. It's accurate data and superior understanding of the students compared to humans proves that it is a much better teacher. In conclusion, the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is very valuable. It can detect the students' emotions during the lesson, it can modify the lesson according to their emotions, and it is much more effective compared to a human. With the Facial Action Coding System, it can pave a path towards a new learning system, one where kids will enjoy being in a classroom rather than falling asleep. One where students will actually want to learn rather than be forced to learn."
6841,0,"The use of this technology to read students' emotinal expressions is valuable in forming an effective lesson, analyzing students' behavior in class, and giving teachers insight on the students' emotional status. This new form of facial technoglogy can help create an effective lesson for the students. In Nick D'Alto's article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", he quotes Dr. Huang, writing that, ""'A classroom computer could recognize whn a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor'"". Dr. Huang tells the reader of a connection within facial expressions of students and overall class productivity. Facial technology could be used to possibly improve a lesson that was perceived as boring according to the students' expressions. This example shows how facial technology could be valuable within the classroom in analyzing students' expressions in creating a more effective lesson for students. New facial technology could be of use in the classroom by spotting certain behavioral problems in students. In the article by Nick D'Alto, he states that, ""[Dr. Paul] Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness-and then associate[s] each with the characteristic movemntes of the facial muscles. For example...your orbicualris oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger"". Students can exhibit certain emotions such as anger or surprise during class could showcase behavioral issues that distracts the student from their lesson. New facial technology could identify certain emotions that show bad behavior among select students during class. The use of facial technology has value in this event, to detect misbehaving students and to prompt them as such to direct attention towards classroom participation. Facial technology can also be of use within the classroom to identify students' emotional status on possibly unknown issues within their lives that can affect their overall classroom participation. In the article by Nick D'Alto, he states that, ""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements-in a real face...By wieghing the different units, the software can even identfy mixed emotions"". Students do have separate lives out of school, and some students could possibly be affected by exterior issues from school. This can affect their overall classroom participation, as their other issues could be serious and make the student unproductive. With new facial technology, one could identify emotions such as unexplained sadness or anger within students and suggest solutions or ways to cope with their issues, thereby restoring their productivity. Thus, new facial technology has value within the classroom to help students seek support and lead to their focus being placed in the classroom. Facial technology in the classroom can root out bad behavioral issues, students emotional status that affects productivity, and create effective lessons that appeal to students. With facial technology, the people can create effective classrooms and increased productivity in students to better pave the path for the next generation's work value and education."

The future is here and it's time to quit holding these new inventions off and time to start accepting that the worlds technology today is limitless. People in our world today are becoming so intellegent that they can invent anything they set thier minds to. First of all, if these car companies have been working on cars that can drive themselves since the 1900's, why should they stop now? Is giving up really worth throwing away 70+ years of hard work and dedication towards inventing smart cars that can drive themselves? NO, don't give up, continue to strive for a better and also safer future for the world today and generations to come. Additionally, not only are these cars really cool and mind blowing, but very helpful to certain people. Imagine someone who has no arms, legs or even a disability that keeps them from driving and thier dream is to be able to drive a car one day, or even just to be able to sit in the drivers seat of an actual moving vehical. Well, with these new cars, their dreams can come true. Finally, safety is the major key for these vehicals. No one is going to want to buy these vehicals or even be in one, if they aren't safe. As soon as companies make sure that these vehicals are 100% safe for families to be in and drive without the risk of a bad injury, there is no doubt that people will be all over these new cars. The worlds future holds many more great inventions that either haven't been thought of, or are being carefully worked on and studied right now. There is no doubt that these cars are the next big thing. So many people will be inspired to create more things if they know someone could create a safe vehical to drive itself, then they can create an invention even better."

Thats probably how she takes all of her pictures you never know, she could have been feeling sad, mad, fearful, or anything unless you were with her at that time of the painting andd she told you how she was feeling.

6456,0,"I don't think this a very valuable piece of technology for students in a classroom because I see no point in reading faces. Of course it will come in handy if you ask a person how they are feeling and they lie to you. Then you can stick this machine in their face ans check if their lying to you or not. And even then you'll still have no idea if the machine is accurate or not because many people can fake their emotions. This machine reads people's faces by what their muscles under the skin are doing. But people can easily fake this. For example, in Paragraph 7 there is instructions on how to look happy. That means happy is easily faked. Same goes for all the emotions that the FACS machine can read. There are some good sides to it too. Like so, in Paragraph 8, it tells that a false smile is easily detected because of the risorius muscles is also moved along with zygomatic major, a muscle in the real smile. Because this muscle joined in, it is clues to when a politician or celebrity isn't being truthful. For example, when a politician says ""If you vote for me, I'll make sure all crime is off the street and no one has to fear death again!"" with the stretched out half smile, it means they're lying. Scientist where able to tell which emotions the Mona Lisa was making because of the FACS machine.

19476,0,"My position on driverless cars are the sould not be any because the negatives make sense. There are positives for the car but I mostly agree with the negative side. In my opinon it would make more sense not to have the driverless cars. The side I am supporting is there should not be any driverless cars on the roads. My reasoning for that is there are already states that made it their law that it is illegal to drive these cars. States like California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia have made it illegal to even test drive driverless cars. Another reason I am against driverless cars is if someone were to get into a crash then how will the one injured be able to get what is owned to them. Who do you blame for the crash? Is it the manufacturers fault or the drivers. The one injured should the able to seek justice. Which isn't possible if there is no one to blame for the wrong doing. All though a driverless car maybe benifical for the owner and the car's company the technology may not always be reliable. Many car manufacturers in the past years have sent out cars that they thought were fine but have caused crashes and deaths. This could be a possible outcome people should not wait for a crash or death to happen. It is nessecary for the laws that other states have to protect their people and provent deaths."

Thousands of anxious web sufers were waitimg when the image first appeared on a JPL web sitr, revealing.... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. but not everyone was satisfied. The face on mars is located at 41 degrees north martain latitude where it was winter in april '98----- a cloudy tie of year on the red plantes. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face. Perhaps,said skeptics aliens markings were hidden by haze..

If 49 out of 60 people react the same what you have youi smnall scale statistics. Class projects could go into the science about how to make some feel a certain way. Class projects won't have to be just stand in front of class and talk you can make them interactive and fun by getting others involved. Since we as humans can do this everyday with other people knowing is they are sad or not what makes you think that we can't programne a comuter to do it for people that are far away. we as humans have automated so much of our daily lives such as little things like making coffee or bigger things like robots that make cars. I think if we can do all that we can make a face ""reader"" Thats all I really got on this topic bye bye."
16692,0,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" they state postive and negative things about driverless cars, driverless cars are not a good part of our future. Driverless cars can be dangerous and they are not as dependable as peole might think they are. Cars that can drive themselves may malfunction and cause a wreck, and get people hurt. Driverless cars are not a good part of our future. Driverless cars are not yet fully driverless. The text states ""Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver?"". The driverless car still needs human control when navigating through work zones and accidents. Humans need to stay aware at all time while this driverless car is at work. The driverless car is not dependable for human beings to do something else while in the car. Driverless cars are a waste of our time because humans still want the thrill of driving a car. Young adults are excited to get thier license and drive out on the open road.These people want to experince driving by themselves and depending on only themselves. Humans would not fully trust a driverless car, because they would trust themselves more going on familar roads than a robot taking them a different route. Driverless cars would be taking away our freedom to go where ever we please. People would not keep their full attention on the road if they knew a driverless car was driving them, they would wonder off into space and not focus on the road. Driverless cars are taking away our right to drive. Having a driverless cars mean relying fully on technology. Technology can fail and leave you stranded on an unfamiliar road. The text states ""The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine"". Driverless cars could freeze up and not do the right action they were supposed to do. These cars could break at the wrong time and cause a major life threating accident. Depending on technology alone is very risky, human beings would not have anything else to rely on, except for themselves alone. Human beings depending on technology alone is a very dangerous concept. However driverless cars can be a good thing for the human race. Driverless cars could prevent less accidents and wrecks from happening. These cars could be the future for people to get more down while they are in the car, but driverless cars need a lot of work and improvement before any human being with a license can go out and buy a vehicle like this. Driverless cars could be a improvement to the enviroment, by cutting down on the gas they use. Driverless cars can also be a good thing. Overall having a driverless car is a dangerous and wreckless thing to buy. Driverless cars are not dependable. Humans like their freedom on the road and enjoy driving their own automobile. People would lose the excitment of first getting a car and license if they didn't have to work for it. Driverless cars are to technology based and could malfunction easily. Driverless cars are not a good part of our future."
16225,0,"I think driveless cars is a bad idea. I think here are many reasons to not have driveless cars. The can be a very dangerous thing. I know it can help with some things, but for the most part we should not have them. In my opinion we should not have driveless cars. I think this because they can be very dangerous. They can be dangerous by having the car drive by itself for a long period of time then need the human to take over and they could have fallen asleep. If the human would not take over then the car could crash and hurt the people inside of it. That is one reason cars should not be able to drive itself. Another reason is some people enjoy driving. I like to drive and if driveless cars take over then people like me won't be able to drive their cars. Also the driveless car could not notice that there is a wreck or construction work ahead and wreck into it. This would just make matters worse. That is my other reason to not have driveless cars. I mean there are a few things that could be good about a driveless car, but for the most part there is more negative things than positive things on them. Also they could be very expensive. People could not afford them. This is why they should not exist."
13002,0,"In the past ten years, humans have experienced an unprecedented growth in technology. This time is not called ""The Age of the Internet"" for no reason, and it is clear that technology is still rapidly advancing. But are all of these developments truly beneficial? As humanity progresses, new ideas are accpeted out of excitement, ignoring many important concerns such as safety. Self-driving cars are a new development that many are interested in, but are considered widely controversial because of the dangers they have. Although self-driving cars seem effective on paper, their technological limitations along with the need for constant human involvement makes them cumbersome, dangerous, and ineffective. Due to driverless cars being an unprecedented invention, many news outlets have included details on their development. Most of these also include details on its growth and future, and also its flaws. Driverless cars, while theoretically solving many issues with transportation, are too significantly limited by technology to be practical. According to the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" a driverless car needs lots of expensive technology to function, such as the LIDAR, a spinning sensor mounted on the roof of the car, and position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel. These are the cars that rely on human involvement to be more or less driverless, so having a truly self-driving car would require even more equipment. With more technology, the vehicle's price skyrockets, making it much more expensive compared to other cars. Additionally, maintence and repair would also be drastically increased to accomdate these many changes. With these factors in mind, it is difficult to see how self-driving cars can gain a sizable portion of the market, and thus unable to be a sustainable industry. Another factor that disavows the benefits of self-driving cars are their limitations. According to ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" self-driving cars need the driver to be alert and ready to respond to complex driving situations. Not only does this defeat the purpose of a self-driving car, it also shows one of the severe limations that this car has. The driver has to be constantly aware of the situation to make these decisions, which means that the car can only move in basic functions. Although this is not a problem in a place where the car can respond effectively, such as a suburb or city, in rural areas or other places with varying terrain, it will be completely ineffective to have a self-driving car. Many different companies would try to create a car that can respond to these systems well. However, this promotes danger and can result in more accidents than if the driver was simply operating the car themselves. Amongst these other problems, the topic of safety is one of the most influential. in the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" only a few states offer limited use of semi-automated cars, and the vast majority outright ban it. It is evident that most of these states focus on the safety aspects of the car when discussing its legality. With these problems, the situation of failing technology can and will occur, which can result in human injury. It is clear that many of the possible situations in which the car had an accident could be remedied by human drivers. ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" mentions the situation where a driverless car has an accident, and who is to blame, the driver or the manufacturer? Such conflicts between the two groups would arise of these situation becomes a reality. Conflicts and changes among traffic laws, taxi drivers, and other businesses that rely on transportation would be significantly impacted if driverless cars come in to play. All in all, the limitations that concern driverless cars are too major to ignore, and will likely be the reason that self-driving cars will not be a feasible reality. While some of these problems can be remedied over time, the current situation of driverless cars is that of a dream."

22162,0,"''The electoral college is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.'' The Electoral College is one of the most fair systems our society has set up. This process is fair and essential because it is is not the only determination, each state gets the correct amount of power, and it shows a clear winner. The Electoral College does is not fully responsible for the outcome of the decision for our President. In the year 2000, this was proved, Gore had received more popular votes than Bush, yet fewer electoral votes. ''It is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote.'' The section of the nation that believes the Electoral College is unfair believes this because they assume all the power is in this system's hands. Yet they are mistaken because clearly our popular vote can override this system if necessary. Though it is very rare most will argue, the fact that it is possible to not allow the Electoral College to take control of our government proves that the power is really all in the hands of the citizens. Clearly, the ''unfair'' picture most perceive is largely mistaken. The sizes of states in our country widely varies. From Rhode Island to Texas, we have power in Congress. It would simply not be fair if our small states had the same amout of power as our larger states. California has more of a population, therefore should have more say in Congress, than New Jersey. ''Your states entitles allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation; one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators.'' Just the way this is set up in Congress, the same amount of power for each state is applied for choosing our President for the next four years. This is only fair to the population of America and equal representation in all the sections of congress would be unfair to the larger states that obviously require and deserve more power than the smaller states in the United States. Basically, power is fairly given to each state under the Electoral College. ''The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast.'' Though this situation is rare, in 1968 when Nixon ran against Clinton, both had a total of 43 percent of the popular votes. Yet, because of the Electoral College, a clear winner was shown. If ever in case of this event, this ''pressure'' can complicate and make the choosing of the President way more difficult than it was planned to be. For this reason, our Electoral College sets up a way to take care of this if it was to happen again. Obviously, the Electoral College shows a clear winner and takes out any confusion or problems that could arise. To conclude, our country is based off of fair rules and systems, one of them being the Electoral College. It is fair because it does not have full power, the right amount of power is applied to each state, and it produces a clear winner. ''Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an electio.''"
7127,0,"The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. It could read the faces of the students and tell when they are getting confused or bored. Also, it could teach people to read facial expressions. Thirdly, it could help with communicating with peers nonverbally and changing your mood. The software could help students with their work if they look confused. The author states, """"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confusd or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (Paragraph 6). The author tells us that by reading the facial expressions, computers could help the students by showing them new ways to do their work. The author also tells us, ""For example, if you smile when a Web as appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different"" (Paragraph 6). By making specific faces, the computer will act differently, which could help students. The software could also teach people to read facials expressions better. An example is gien when the author states, ""In fact, we humans perform this same ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face"" (Paragraph 5). By looking at a person we can tell how they feel just by the face they make.The auhor also says, ""Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that coveys happy, worried, etc"" (Paragraph 5). The software dectects theslightest movements of each facial muscle, which for the average human can be difficult to read. The produced software could help students communicate with their peers nonverbally and change your mood. One example is when the author states, """"Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" notes Dr. Huang. ""So computers need to understand that, too."""" (Paragraph 6). Human interaction is full of nonverbal expressions and indications. The author also tells us, ""According to the Facial Feedback Theor of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them"" (Paragaph 9). Making a specific face could stimulate which emotion you feel at given times. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. It can help using multiple ways that no one would ever think of. A few ways it could help are telling when students are confused or bored, helping learn expressions, help communicating with peers nonverbally, and changing their mood."
16575,0,"The author of ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" did a pretty good job of weighing out the positives and negatives of driverless cars. He seemed to be leaning towards the development of driverless cars. My position is very similar to the author's. Driverless cars could be very useful in the near future. While compiling a list of pros and cons, it can be seen that the ratio of the two are about one to one. The first positive of driverless cars is the fact that no one will have to spend the money to buy a car anymore. The text states, ""...a future with a public transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public-transport taxi system."" If this public-transport system was to occurr, no one would have to spend the ridiculous amount of money it takes to buy a car. These people could put the money they saved from not buying a car towards other expenses. Over a person's lifetime, they would be more likely to spend less money on the taxi fees than they would on buying a car and putting gas in it. The overall expense of gas in a person's driving lifetime adds up to hefty amounts. The topic of gasoline is talked about world wide. Countries are producing it and using it just as quickly. Soon, the world will be dried up of all it's oil and we will have to resort to other means of power for our cars. One way we could slow down the consumption of gasoline is by developing driverless cars. If a public-transport system is set up, less people will have cars to fill up with gas, therefore less oil is being used annually. The text states, ""The cars...would use half the fuel of today's taxis..."" If the United States made the switch to driverless cars, we would only use about half of the oil we use today. This would not only be good in the sense of saving precious fossil fuels, but also in the sense of saving the environment. More people would use the public-transport system meaning there would be less cars on the road. This would reduce the amount of carbon emmissions and help save the environment. If the mass public-transport system would come into existance, how would it be any different than the public-transport systems we have today? Most people who use public-transport ride a bus. Busses stick to schedules and will not change according to a specific person's schedule. This can pose many issues for people. If driverless cars were used as a form of public-transport, there would be more flexibility in schedules. A driverless car service would function almost identically to a taxi service, but as stated earlier, would be more environmentally friendly. The text states, ""The cars...offer far more flexibility than a bus."" Many people forsee populations becoming more environentally friendly and hopping on board with the driverless car idea. With the positives of driverless cars, there are also some negatives. With these ""driverless cars,"" the human driver still has to be alert in order to take over in certain traffic conditions. The text states, ""In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" Why call them driverless cars if they aren't entirely driverless? Even though human drivers occasionally have to put in small amounts of work, the car does most of the work. The text states, ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves..."" After that, what all is left to do? The car just needs a little assistance every now and then. Everyone has formed different opinions on whether or not driverless cars should be used widespread. After weighing out the pros and cons, it seems like the positive aspects out-weigh the negative ones. If driverless cars were more widely used, we would see improvement in the environment, less fossil fuels being used, and less money being put towards cars and being put towards other expenses."
22966,0,"Dear senator, I highly suggest you to reconsider about voting for that particular president. There might be quite a few people that voted for that person. Also there is a lot of people that like the other canidate. Most of the people that are not eligable to vote would want you to make the right choice. Now that most states have a winner take all system it is not very fair for all the people in one state just to go to one person. It is the right thing to do to get all of the people in one state just to vote for the canidate that they want to take over the oval office. It would be a better system and would have less of a possible risk just to get a tie in the ellectoral college. So i highly regard this letter just to let you know that changing the way of voting would make a big deal to all of the country. It would benefit the whole country that every person could make a big difference in the elections of modern society. In the future we will have what is called chaos in the voting polls. None of the voting will matter because the electors will get to decide who will be president. Scincerely, Dylan"
6562,0,"This technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a class room is valuable. The artical states, ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."" (Making Mona Lisa Smile, paragraph 5). This means that it can explain better what is actually wrong with a person rather than the person trying to explain for themselves. Another reason why this technology is valuable in a classroom is because when you are faking an emotion or hiding a specific emotion, the computer can actually identify what exact emotion you are hiding. The article later goes on by saying, ""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements. By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion)."" (Making Mona Lisa Smile, paragraph 4). In conclusion, this technology is valuble in a classroom because it can detect different kinds of emotions the students are giving off. Also it tells what kinds of muscles are being used to show the emotion you are showing."
15133,0,"In the atricle ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" scienists at NASA discovered a face looking formation on Mars. After a picture of the face was released many people thought that it had proved that there are living aliens on Mars. While many scientists think that the face was formed naturally there are some scientists that believe it was formed by an alien race. The scientists that think the formation was created by an alien might argure that the picture from MGS was not getting a clear picture because it was winter on Mars causing it to be a cloudy time of year. But in paragraph nine it says,"" MGS is a mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the planet like a fax machine in narrow 2.5 km-wide strips, "" so therefore the weather had nothing to do with the picture of the face. In 2001 scientist at NASA took another picture of the face that was closer to it than previous pictures and looking at the picture you could clearly see that there wasn't any "" Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks,""therefore there is no proof of any life. In paragraph twelve a scientist compared the face on Mars to a natural land form on Earth and the scientist figured they were created the same way, "" That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" In conclusion many people might think that there is alien life on Mars from the Face of Mars but there are so many facts that prove them wrong."
8482,0,"Classroom around the world, yes ALL of them, should use this technology that reads emotions. People may ask "" And how can a computer recognize facial movements? The answer is through FACS. This technology consists of three major components that may be greatly helpful. First off it's going to be extremly helpful. According to the passage, ""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movement- in a real face..."" (paragraph 4).With that being, it can help teachers figure out if students lie, tell the truth, smile, laugh, not in a swell modd and etc. It just makes life go way smoother, than just always have to guess. In the passage, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" (paragraph 6). It just would be one thing that a school should have to just help the students and staff. Then there is the emotion part which makes this the best for student at school. FACS can be used as a learning opportunity. We can learn forms and structures of the face when emotion is present. If this technology is used we will know more about the facila movements and much more. Meanwhile, many structure and muscles were stated in the excerpt, ""orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus.""

18083,0,"Driving cars can be a pain. Especially since the one driving has to pay attention to the road at all times. If they dont, they could injury someone and also themself, but what if there was a car that could change that? Google has been developing a car that is self driving. The idea of driverless cars has been though about for a while and seems pretty good in theory.They have had this capability since 2009 although the car had to be under specific conditions. I am personally unsure about this idea. The idea and future of driverless is a little uncertain because it will reduce the amount of accidents, it still has the ability to be human controlled, and it will require some law changes. Car accidents are usually the result of human error so what if the human error was removed? Google modified a Toyota Prius with a sensor on the roof, left rear wheel, a video camera in the rear view mirror, four radar sensors, a GPS reciever, and an internal motion sensor. Thias will detect just about anything around it so ifsomeone is driving on a street and they stop infront of because of a red light, the google car behind them will recognize that action and stop itself. Although this part maybe true, what about an abrupt stop? Even if the Google car has advance and fast technology the connection bettween the camera, sensors, andbrakes is going to be ever so slightly delayed because thats just how things are. Nothing is instantanious so this could be a problem for the cars. also not everyone will have one when the cars first are open to the public so this could result in accidents happening to google cars instead of the self driving cars hitting other cars Even though the car is self driving, it can still be controlled by the human who is seated inside so this means that there are no naps behind the wheel on inner-city streets. On highway one could probably takle a load off because there isnt any intense traffic unless they're in california or some other crowded place. in 2013 BMW announced something called ""Traffic Jam Assistance."" This means that the car can handle itself but the driver myust keep a hold of the wheel at all times. This will keep the driver alert and ready for any situation that will require their assistance like getting out of a parking garage or moving up slowly on a crowded highway. The car will notify when the driver needs to be assisted, kind of like GM with their vibrating seats that notify if the driver is about to back into an object. But with ability for human control there is still room for error because as humans it's sure to happen. Having driverless cars will take some law changes to have them and also to test them. Most states have laws against testing them, mainly for saftey reason which is understandable. Cities dont want some technology that they are unsure about running around. Also what if there is an accident? Who is to blame - Google, The driver, or the car itself? Its not a very easy question to answer becuase if the car hits someone it could've been the car's fault but the driver is going to have to pay for it and face consequences because they own it, and then the driver is going to try and take it up with the maufacturer. Basically everyone is getting sued if there is an accident which is something to take into consideration. The law-makers of the Federal government would be busy becuase they would have to revidse laws and change laws. This idea for selfdriving cars is pretty good in theory but in practice, it might be a nightmare. Things like this are always strange becuase manufacturers could spend all this time devloping and then one test goes wrong and then they government will trash the whole idea. It would be nice to have selfdriving cars but the world may not be ready for it yet. The first thing they need to handle is more testing if they want any chance of making it happen, because the question is no longer if we have the ability to do it. The real question is ""Should we do this?"""
8375,0,"Think about how much technology has been chaning for the past couple of years. It came from a single passcode, to now using your face to unlock your smart devics. This is the next step with technology, and now it's being used to read your emotions. New softwear called the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) could read how a person is feeling. With this new technolgy it could help read people that could hide their feelings. This could help to better understand a person. In paragraph 7 it says ""In a realsmile, the zygomatic major (muscles that begin atyour cheek bones) lift the corners of your mouth. Meanwhile, muscles called obrbicularis oculi pars palpabeaeus make crow's-feet aound your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is streched sideways using the zygomatic major, and a different muscle, the risorios. To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""simling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" With this huge chunk of evidence, it can be boiled down to this. When a smile is real thedevice can tell, and when it's fake it could also tell. With this information you could make a better judgement about a politician, or celebrity. You would be able to tell if they were fake or not. Another amazing thing it could do is tell if you are liking something or not. in paragraph 6 it says, ""For example, if you simle when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" This shows that it can read your face a something that you might not like. Then try to change it into something that you do like. Another reason is that in the classroom. There are computer labs that could hold a whole classroom, and the teacher can't be at everyone's computer. The FACS would read the face to see if they were borad or confused, and then modify it if they were. In paragraph 6 it says ""A classromm computer could recongnize when a student is becoming conused or borad,"" Dr. Huang Predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like and efective human instructor."" This would ensure that the kids are getting the right education they need without always having the teacher around. With all of this it could help people just also be awear of their surroundings. It would help in the classroom too. OVerall this is the right step for all of technology to have in it. If it's your computer, or phone it doesn't matter. They would all benifit of having the FACS in it."
601,0,"This article starts out by telling the audience about all of the pros and cons of Venus. The first thing is mentions is how at some times we are so close to it that many people think it is a star, and it talks about how humans on Earth can easily see it at a safe distance, but it is very difficult to get close to. Venus is the cloest planet to Earth's density and size. The author explains how he thinks that it is a worthy cause to try to explore venus, even though we have never successfuly landed a spacecraft there for more than a few hours. The author does very well arguing his or her point. I agree with the author, I think he or she made some very well stated points about why humans should work everyday to get closer and closer to Venus. There are many arguing points as to why poeple would think that it is good or bad to try to send spacecrafts, let alone humans, to Venus. Starting out with the dissadvantages, the planet's surface is over 800 degrees, obviously not suitable for humans, or any life force for that matter, to survive. Venus has a hotter surface temperature than any other planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun, due to the atmosphere made up of almsot 97 percent carbon. These facts sound misserible so far, but if there was a way that humans could figure out how to land on Venus safely, and maybe even start a civilization there, that would be groundbreaking. The author backs up his or her point by saying how ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" The fact that at one time Venus might have been covered in water has convienced me that there is some sort of way to create life there. Not only does he or she mention how Venus might have once been covered in water, but also informs the audience that Venus has many Earth-like structures. Venus is made up of mountians, valleys, and craters. The author does a very good job describing and pin-pointing all of the detailed needed to convience someone to beilve in life on Venus, and support sending probes and eventually humans out to discover Venus. The authors talks about how hard it would be for a mission to Venus to be both safe and productive, but he or she also talks about how much we would gain from it. The author shows how floating in a blimp, 30 miles above the surface would be almost suitable for humans to survive, at 170 degrees. The article says that ""Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus."" One day humans will be able to land a spacecraft on Venus long enogh to collect information about the planets past."
2440,0,"in this article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" it talks about the dangers and harsh eviroment that venus has. Also shows how much of a hard task it is to get their technology up their with out it being destroyed due to the tempertures. The main objective of this article wants to point out that it is trying to studie the planet Venus because of its close resimblence to earth except for tempertures but the density and mass of it. This article really does have a good point to it considering on how much time and studies go into this planet. one of their plans is to fray above the atmosphere just enough so that they are able to withstand most of the harsh conditions to last a good amount of time. They even tested it in a similar enviroment that they made acustomed to the same enviroment as venus has and it lasted 3 weeks at the most. But their are other things that they are thinking of doing such as they are thinking of using old technology that was presented around the 1940's just because ""these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do note require electronics at all."" the point that they are trying to make is that mechanical stuff is more durable and modern technology. You see modern technology is flexible, powerful, and quick but mechanical gears are more capable of withstanding the extreme pressure and heat that venus can throw at them. This planet is very old and it is to say that it once held a hospitable enviroment with oceans and trees and life as we now it. But as you can see, now it isn't doing very well so that is why we want to studie it because of its mysterious past. So as they said "" our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" so what they are saying is that the limits are boundless."
17627,0,"The statement that has been gooing around stating ""the face on Mars was created by aliens."" The statement is false, the face you have seen on mars is a natural landform. The photos you have seen was a hill developing in the process over time. We have taken a photo of the strange spot on the planet Mars and it has been reported,that it is a natural landform. We did not have the same technology as what we have had in the past. When we first took the picture we did not have the same technology so we had a blurry picture. But when we have our technology now, we have better cameras so that we can get a better image of the big red planet called Mars. We have no proof that aliens have built this face in the surface on mars. This face you see on the planet is just a landform. The face you might see in the photograph is just a mind illusion that you might see a face. the face you see is a hill that has been formed by the ways of the planet its self. It might have been molding from the dust and the wind dragging the red sand and dirt off of the hill its self. We have no way or knowledge to know that aliens have built this face on the hill. The face has been forming for probably thousands and thousands of years. We think the forming on mars, like craters and hole in the ground, plus the face is just a natural landform forming on the crust of mars its self. How would we know if other forms of life built this face?...We dont know because we do not have that much knowledge about the space. There are infifnity of space out their that we have not explored yet so how would we know if the aliens have built this. The thought of this statement that aliens have built this face in the crust of mars is ludicris. The face on mars has been formed by natural landformings in the crust of Mars. The theory of aliens made the face is as dumb as a bump on a log."
5705,0,"I think the technology for the facial action coding system is a good idea beause the computer will be able to tell your emotion and see weather your happy or not. It can tell emotion from celebrity's and how they are feeling. It can also determan if someone is fake smiling or not just by the muscles in there face. the computer can tell 6 diffrent moods you might be in, happy, sad, angry, fear, disgust and surprised. The articles says ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles"". That is telling you how the computer would be able to detect your emotions. The article also says ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"". Meaning if you are happy and act like you are sad it can still tell that your happy. The new computer technology can even identify mixed emomtions as well. The article claims that ""each expression is compared against a neutral face"", meaning showing no emotion. Therefore you can tell how someone you know is feeling with the new technolgy. Its all about the muscular units in your face that tells it all. That is why i think that the new technology called facial Action Coding System is a good idea. it is something fun to do and help figure out what people are feeling. To an expert, faces dont lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful.."

1976,0,"As a young child peers into the endless night sky from his bedroom window, a bright flickering spot catches his eye and leaves a single question in his mind: ""Is there anybody there?"" In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author writes about that same bright spot, known as Venus, and explains that studying this planet will real human scientists is worth it despite the many obstacles it raises. By including staggering information of the endless hazards and later reassuring their readers with astonishing facts and likely solutions to survival, the author clearly supports their ideas very well. There may just be a chance for us to see Venus as more than just a bright little star after all. Initially, the author puts more focus to the first half of their claim as they describe the dangers of this not-so-easy planet. The author informs us that even mighty submarines would not stand a chance in the undoubtably strong Venusian atmosphere; they continue to say that most metals would simply melt under its pressure (paragraph 3). By including such daunting information that makes human life anywhere near Venus seem impossible, it can easily be seen that the author supports that Venus is no cake-walk. Also in paragraph three, the author includes ""additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes"" in the background of Venus's already packed daily weather forecast. The author used these earthly disasters and explained how they happen regularly on Venus to prove just how many abstacles there are for scientists who wish to go to the planet, furthure showing their understanding of the idea that putting humans of Venus could be very harmful. Thankfully, exploring this scary planet has its hopeful side. Near the middle of this passage, the author begins to turn Venus, no pun intended, and the conversation on taking humans there to a more positive angle. In paragraph four, the author writes about how Venus most likely used to be much like the place we currently live; it had amazingly Earth-like characteristics like huge oceans, mountains, and possibly even life similar to ours. With such exciting facts that leave even more questions about the mysterious planet, the author is proving to us that they know Venus has secrets worth uncovering. The author later tells the readers of a plan by NASA to make is possible to harbor human scientists near the Venusian surface by using a ""blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles [above Venus]..."", informing that the situation would in fact be viable for life (paragraph 5). The author showed how they highly agree with the part of their idea that analyzing Venus up close should happen by giving a reassuring soulution from such a well known and trusted organization as support. Exploring our planet's twin seems like it's not such a giant leap anymore, rather, it looks like it will only take a few small steps. Keeping all of this information in mind, it is clear that the author is a firm beleiver that Venus, although it has put many seemingly impenatrable obstacles in our way, is worth taking a look at with human eyes. If we follow calls to action such as this, we will put the human race just that much closer to understanding the mysteries of the infinite universe around us, but Venus is a good starting point. As a young boy's eyes slowly slide shut, he can still see a tiny flahing light shining through the darkness outside his window blinds; he dreams of the day he can finally meet it."
8150,0,"The use of this technology in classrooms would be very valuable. For example, if a student were to need comforting or assistance with work or just needs to talk the teacher would be able to tell and help them. Also, if this technology progresses it could be aquired by all schools and help greatly with counselors. Most students are afraid to ask questions because they want to seem smart. For that reason, they fail that assignment and still do not understand how to solve the problem. This could lead to a bad grade in the class and having to re-take it. With the Facial Action Coding System, teachers could see if a student if feeling frustrated or confused about the problem and they could help them instead of that student failing. A lot of students cheat because they feel they will get a better grade. This leads to bad grades in the future though, when they can't cheat. With the technology in this article, teachers would be able to analyze the students emotions after being asked if they cheated. The Facial Action Coding System would be able to tell if the face they make is false or not and determine if they are being truthful. There may be students who don't want their emotions to be discovered. If someone is hiding their feelings it is most likely for a good reason. Students and adults don't have to have their emotions calculated if they truly don't want to. That would be a violaton of privacy. Everyone has the option to refuse this method. This system would also make counseling much more successful. When students go to their counselor they sometimes feel embarrassed with sharing personal information with them. This occassionally leads to students hiding how they feel in order to feel better. With the system counselors could see how the students really feel and be able to help them feel better more efficiently. All of these examples provide enough information to support the Facial Action Coding System. Schools everywhere would benefit greatly from the system."

10323,0,"I am agaisn't driverless cars. I believe that it is dangerous because the car drives itself unless it involves navigating through workzones, in and out of driveways, or around accidents, then it requires human skill. Also, I think it shows laziness for people. I feel that the car has more negative aspects, than positive. and what's the point of it if it requires a person inside of the car, if it's meant to be driverless? ""This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the stituation requires"". (p.7) This shows that (hence the word ""driverless'') the car isn't driverless and that it needs human skill, in order for it to be a safe motor vehicle. but, even in that case it is still not a safe car, it still have many negative aspects involved, such as ""The car can handle driving functions at speeds of 25 mph"". (p.7) If the car is only going 25 mph couldn't that cause traffic accidents? Also, that could be breaking the law, testing computer-driven cars are alreay illegal in most states. For example, what if you were on the interstate and the you were supposed to be going 60 mph, but you couldn't because you were in a driverless car. that could cause many traffic accidents. The car isn't a safe, or trusting vehicle, there is proof that shows in the article that the car is dangerous for civilians. driverless cars are only a hazard for the public. The only positive and safe (in my opnion) aspect of the car is that you could turn off displays if you wanted to drive the car, and then it could be a normal vehicle. ''Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over"". (p.8) Finally, even though in my opinon the car is dangerous and untrusting, alot of people may find alot of interest in the vehicle because it is so advanced; as in (p.8) Dr, Werner Huber states ""We have to interpret the driving fun in a new way"". The car will also probably help alot of car companies with selling, expecially if they have a new futuristic, driverless vehicle in stock."

Teachers should be able to read to use FACS (Facial Action Coding System) to understand the students emotions expessions for multiple reasons.To start off with teachers need to understand the student to be able to connect with each other. A teacher is a leader a person to lean off of but if they are not connected on the same page because the teacher doesnt understand to students emotion epessions they wont get far. As teenagers as young adilessons there emotions are off the charts some ore than others and just like that its not good to keep all of that inside,teacher with access to facs ( Facial Action Coding System ) cant have an encounter with the student talking about there feelings.

11956,0,"The face that you see on Mars is not actually a face; it's a messa or landform. We can prove this with updated cameras and mulitiple missions. After the Face on Mars was first seen in 1976, many mission have been taken to Mars to prove the conspiracy theorists wrong. One example was the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) misson sent in September of 1997, eighteen years after the Viking mission. Other missions include the mission taken by Michael Malin and his MOC team also on board the MGS. Another mission took place on April 8, 2001 with the highest resolution cameras during that time. On April 5, 1998, the Mars Golbal Surveyer (MGS) flew over a region called Cydonia, with Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera crew. (MOC) The team took pictures with a camera that had a ten times shrarper resolution, than the camera used in the Viking photos taken back in 1976. People began to think that the pictures could have been taken during the winter in April '98 which is a cloudy time of year on Mars. So, three years later on April 8, 2001, the MGS went back to Mars and captured more pictures on a cloudless summer day in Cydonia. Their cameras had the absolute maximum resoultuion in these pictures, with a pixel span of 1.56 meters per pixel rather than the 43 meters per pixel used int he Viking phots back in 1976. The image of a face in the Viking photos in 1976 were caused by shadows giving the illusion of a nose, mouth, and eyes on a rock formation as stated in passage three. The rock formation or messa is similar to those found on Earth in the American west. More likely similar to a ""Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" according to Jim Garvin, the cheif scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program. These messa's are very common aroud the Cydonia area of Mars as well. This goes to prove that these rock formations aren't random; they can be found all over the region. The only difference with the Face it that its unusual shadows made it look like it was something that it was not. Conspiracy theorists may think that this face is a sign of life on Mars but it wouldn't be logical to believe what you hear and see on TV and radio shows, or what you read in a magazine; unless the information was coming form a reliable source. How could a face made of rock prove that thre is life on Mars? The only logical answer most likely doesn't exist. Then again, in passage five people say that it could be evidence of an ancient civilaization on Mars, but civialiaztions don't live off of rocks. Going back to the point of cameras, as higher resolution camers come into play, more and more does the landform begin to look less like a face and more like a...rock. Its also not likely that the formation was made by aliens. Even if the fromation was made by aliens (or any other civiliztion) you would think that these aliens would have made other rock formations as well that would have been similar to the Face, but as far as I know, there is no evidence of life on Mars or any other planet besides Earth for that matter. In conclusion these are the resons and facts that i give you to convice you that the Face on mars in nothing but a natrual rock formation."

There a lot of things you can learn about the planet but it's dangerous in many ways. Going to venus to study it can be a dangerous mission. Study shows that not one spaceship has landed on venus in more than three decades. The way venus is, is what makes it so hard to land and get near it. 97 perfect of the air is carbon dioxide in venus and the land reaches over 800 degress Fahrenheit. Not only that is what makes it hard but also the clouds and the fact that the atmospheric pressure is 90 times more than what we witness in our earth. Venus wants to be studied by scientist for important reasons and many also. According to the text, Venus is one of closest planets that is similar to earth. Those bring ideas to scientist that maybe there was life there long ago or maybe they can examine it and see if maybe there could be life there in the future. The planet is very close shaped like our earth and also still have some appearances like our planet. According to the text, Venus has a surface of rocky sediment and also has valleys, mountains, and craters. These are a lot of smiliarities to our planet and is the reason why scientist would like to learn more things about it and study it more."

Not only is banning cars good for the enviroment it is also good for the well being of the human race. In the following passages ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", ""Car-free day is a big hit in Bogota"", and ""The End of Car Culture"" mention the finner points about why being ""car-free"" is benificial. By far, Europe is once again ahead of the United States due to the fact that many countries dont use cars, but they travel to their next destination by train, tram, bus, and walikng. Unlike America, almost every one is using a car to get to their next place, and barely use a bus. According to the passage "" The End of Car Culture"" our own president of the United States is making goals to help improve the ""greenhouse gas emissions"" but just like the title suggest the end of cars are near. "" The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world's prime car cultures"" researchers are noticing a decline in the buying and selling of cars nation wide. ""Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate.""It has already accelerated in Europes biggest capitals the world has come to know and love. Paris. The ""city of love"" or the city of smog, has banned driving due to record high reports of smog. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partcial driving ban to clear the air of the globla city"" according to the passage "" Paris bans driving due to smog"" smog in the ""city of love"" is not quite romantic as a city without smog. Paris alone ""... had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter..."". Banning cars and fining people is one way to help clear the air of pollution, so their is more room for love, laughter, and happiness. ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals."" well maybe the smog and love can share the air. Lets travel all the way back to the Americas to see how the smog is doing there in the countyr of Colombia. Bogota, Colombia located in South America has had its own little smog problems just like Paris. ""The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog."" a whole day of either biking, hiking, skating, walking,or taking a taxi and/or bus, to get to work or school. In the Passage ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" explains to us why we should stop using cars but rather rely on our body than a 3,000 pound peice of machinerery. "" The days without cars is part of an imporvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s."". For almost 25 years Bogota, Colombia once a year celebrates a day to help reduce smog, and produce a happy, healthy, and smog free life style. ""'The rain hasnt stopped people from participating,'"" remarks Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus. there may have been a few gray clouds, but that doesnt keep people form not supporting their own enviroment. Good Job to Bogota, and see what tricks Germany has up their sleeve. Picture this: an upscale suburban community in Vauban, Germany; where soccer moms are taking there children to soccer practice, and big CEO executives are going to work. They're getting to their next destination not by car, because in this town of 5,500 people, nobody has a car because they have give up the life of ""Car Culture"". The passage ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", well truely they do. Who needs cars when you go to work by bike, train, skateboard, roller skates, or the traditional walking. ""Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to seperate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called 'smart planning.'"" What amkes this ""smart planning"" truely genius, is that everbody is totally cool with it. For ""the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs..."". Vauban may be just an experimental suburb, but the people who live in it seem to enjoy the life without the hastle of smog producing vehicles. ""When I had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" states Heidrum walter, a resident of the green suburban town Vaubran. Many countries world wide have gone ""car-free"" due to either smog or maybe even banned them entirely. Countries all over the wolrd are seeing a difference in their community every day when they don't drive a car. not only is going ""car-free"" great for the reduction of smog, but you can live a happier, healthier, and stress-free life style; like most people have noitced from Bogota, Colombia to the small suburban town Vauban, Geramny.

513,0,"The aurthor dose well in explaining details about venus. Scientists keep learning about venus even though its dangerous? Why, we beleive to think that the reason why scientist continue working on sending man to venus is mostly because the planet is closest to earth and they think it can be a twin of earth with mountains valleys and at one point in time it has had some form of life. On paragraph 4 ""astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most earth-like planet in our solar system."" It states that long ago it could of had been ""covered largely with oceans."" But if scientists say that the planet is so ""inhospitable"" why are scientists planing to visit much furher into the venus planet? Venus has much to offer when it comes to learning about it, reffering to the amount of sulfuric acid in the clouds (how'd they get like that?) If scientist say that earth can be simmilar to venus, will earth get like that, ""corrosive couds?"" I'd like to think not because no matter venus is closer to the sun and eath is just far ways from it. If a submarine attempts to go down into the depths of the water there in venus. There can be major damage done to the submarine which is accustomed to go under water but it's the metal that'll melt from the sulfuric acid and the hot tempatures of the planets surface. Venus is known for the hottest planet's tempature throughout the solar system. Venus is worthy of pursuit despite the dangers because scientists are wanting to find out if the planet used to be like earth before. If it had been covered largely with oceans? Or simlpy as much as having any sorce of life it may of have had or hadn't had. Wouldn't you like to find out if venus was once like earth before?"

The person running with the most votes should win. Let the citizens decide who they want as president. The 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century. Which is why people went against the electoral college. It could be worse, nobody wants that. They might be worrying about a tie in the electoral vote. The election is only a few swing voters away from a catastrophe. The electoral college is unfair to voters. I don't think the electoral college votes are neccessary to decide a president. I am pretty sure,any people agree. Many people that were presidence got lucky because of the electoral votes. There are many people that ran for president but lost because of the electoral votes when they shouldn't have lost. Nobody wants a close tie to see who the president is. Electoral college just ruins the point of our rights to vote. We, as citizens, shouldn't have electoral college to decide who our president is. We should be able to vote and decide the president.

The auother starts the story by giving us some points about Venus, on how it is known by the ""Evening Star"" and it is the second closest planet to the sun. A little further in the story the auother gives us an idea how dangerous it is, one point being how thick the atmosphere is in Venus. But then giving us information on why this planet is imporatant, by telling the readers that this is the most Earth-like planet. Then giving us another example of how dangerous it is to even be close to the planet. One of the first points the auother made was on how thick the amotsphere is. As this being one of the first points that they said it must be one of the most important things to know, on why it is dangerous to here even land there. The auother goes on getting more into detail about how thick the atmophere is and ""almost 97 percent"" is carbon dioxide, and then explaing to the reader that the atmospheric pessure is ""90 time greter than what we experience on our own planet"". These conditions are no match for a human as it can ""crush even a submarine,"" thus showing how bad the conditions are for any human. In this topic the auother does very good on his explantions giving the reader information on how bad the atmosphere is, and giving good examples. Further into the story the author goes into why the planet Venus is so important. Not saying this right away but as you go on to read paragraph 4 the auother brings up on that Venus is the ""most Earth-like planet"". The auother estimates that Venus had life like things with large oceans and ""supported various forms of life"". Venus still has some Earth features such as ""valleys, mountrains,and craters"". The auother does not go into this as much but still gave good examples and enough informatuion. Keeping our distance from Venus is very important. This point kind of brings us back to the atmosphere being so dangerous. the auother goes in om talking about how we have ti keep our distance because of the ground condtions. But hovering the planet limit ""insight on ground condtions,"" because of the dense atmosphere. This will not stop us from trying to get closer to the planet, as many researchers are "" working on innvations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledgeof Venus. The auother did enough infortmation and was good enough for readers to picture how bad the condtions were but there is still an up side to it. Bringing all the points together. The auother making good statements, readers might say we should risk the condtions. If the auother is very right with these points, readers will say we should risk the condtions and go for a new life. As we sit here and waste this beautiful planet we could be trying to have a new life in new condtions."

So if there were objects such in this picture like airplanes on the gound or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were,"" said, Jim Garvin, a scientist for NASA's Exploration Program. Showing that is there were any types of alien creations they could be seen through the monitors. Also, in 1976 the technologies weren't the same compared to1998 and 2001. The picture in 1976 was blury and hardly visable. As time goes on the picture gets more clear and you can see how it looks more naturaly formed. Lastly, its a natural landform because theres other natural land forms on America that can be compared to the ""face"". ""It reminds me of most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho... that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated masa about the same height as the Fce on mars,"" says Garvin."
24274,0,"Dear Senator: I'am writing you this letter to inform you that I argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College. Why? Because this progress is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. A dispute over the out come of an Electoral College vote is possible, it happened in 2000. All of this reasons are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons. The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. In Electoral College the electors are the one who elect the president not the people and my opinion is that its a good idea because not everyone has the same opinion. When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. The meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. This process consists of 538 electors. The amount of 270 electoral votes is requiered to elect the President. The district of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of The Electoral College. Each candidate that is running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. It is necessary to have this groups so you can be the president. Well Senator I hope you like this letter and feel sure why you have to keep the Electoral College. I know you would keep it because you are a good Senator and you want the best for everyone in the state. Remember that this is very important for the people who think that you should keep this very important process that has grow in all state of the United States of America."
761,0,"The text ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" treats a very important decision, that is the worthines of pursuing or not the study of the planet Venus despite the danger it presents, the author agrees to this idea of pursuing said study, but he support's his idea of studying Venus in a very poorly way. The autor of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" made the text so that people would know the rewards of exploring Venus, but during the text he does nothing but make the idea less apealing to the eyes of the people, this is shown by the following excerpt ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 time greater than what we experience in our own planet.... Venusion geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.""this excerpt is one of the reasons this text apeals more to an idea of disagreement than one of agreement, making the reader feel more inclined to disagree with the authors oppinion, being this the opposite of the whole reason of the text. This also can be shown by the next quote "" However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the panet can provide only limited inshight on ground conditions... More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance."" this quote not only does not help the authors point of view but it also contradicts this passage, ""The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientis to float above the fray."" this causes a clash of ideas, wich is not a good think to try and convince people. In conclusion the Text of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" creates a feeling of disagreement/fear towards the idea of studying the planet venus, this is conflicting with the idea of worhtines of pursuit of venus that the author tries to give the text, meaning that the text does not support the author's idea and if it does it, is in a very poorly way."
16346,0,"In this artical, Driverless cars are coming, tells us about the technological development that we are able to come up with today. My standpoint on the driverless cars is that I am against them. Not only are they dangerous, but they can also be deadly. they can easly crash, they can put people out of jobs, and they would also take a lot of money to build firstly, the driverless cars can easly crash. If the driver is not paying attention, the car would not be able to navigate by itself, therefore causing a possible accident. The driverless car is still technically not a driverless car, it still needs human help, like backing out of driveways, navigating in difficult traffic construction, and also navigating through roadwork. if the driver is not alert, then the cr would not be able to turn itself. secondly, they would put millions of taxy driver and other people out of work. if the problems are worked out of the car, them they will soon be on the road. the taxi services and other car makers will soon be out of work because then would the people of the usa want to drive themselfs around when they could just sit back and relax while the car does all the work. thirdly, they will be a lot of money to build. Just to build one of them would cost millions and millions of dollers. this would then put the economy at risk because it is being taken out of state taxes. this would cause the government to start taxing everything to help get the taxes back up. with all of the sensors and technology put into the driverless car, nobody would be able to buy it, maybe millionairs. in conclusion, the driverless car seens to be a good ides, but thinking about it now, with all the new styled technology bring put into it, you just have to weigh the risks and the good things involved with owning it. its a great idea, but it still seems to have some gliches."

He doesn't know for sure, what adventures he will face. What he does know, is that these adventures will be very fascinating. As you can already see, this program would be fun for anyone to join. Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece. He went on cattle-boat trips and saw the Acropolis. He also took a gondola ride, which was in the streets of Venice, Italy. He says "" Besides helping people, I had the side benifit of seeing Europe and China."" Luke is having a really good time helping people and enjoying himself. While coming back from these places, Luke would entertain himself. Since there were others on the trip back, they would play games. They would play baseball and volleyball. The crew held table tennis tournements,too. To pass time, he would read, fence, whittle, and box. As you can see, there are a lot of fascinating, exciting, and fun things that those who participate in the Seagoing Cowboys do. There are multiple reasons why you should join the program. You can do good deeds and help others, while leaning more and enjoying yourself. You could also make new friends.For these reasons, I hope that you will join the Seagoing Cowboys program."

I don't see this technology being bad or no good because it really does help when it comes to social interaction. The artical says that they are able to calculate other peoples emotions beginning with the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face, and then all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscle. Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System), has classified 6 basic emotions, which are happiness, surprise, anger, digust, fear, and sadness, and accociated each emotion with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. With this information, I would want this technology to help me with social interactions and having conversations with fellow students. I would want someone to know how I feel before talking to me because I get annoyed when people talk to me that are rude when I'm happy or someone talking to me trying to joke around when I'm angry."

I thhink if we know what emotions someone is having we would have a better chance of helping them. I like the idea of helping others. We can improve are way of teaching others with this tech. It says in paragraph 1 "" Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate."" we need to leave it to the experts to help us find better ways to communicate with humans and computers.

But, i dont think believe that a face on Mars was created by another life form beside humans. There has been theries for centurys about space, that we are not alone and people from diffrent planets exsist. I dont think so because it there were other life forms out there why havent they made contact. Space is full of adventure, discovery, and wonder but to come to the realization that there are other life form beside or own. It would change how people think and would change reality forever. They put aliens on movies and telivision for entertainment only not to be taken into content. The face on Mars is just a creation of all the space debry and the astroieds that hit Mars and have sculpted in to resembling a human figure or ( human face). The face on Mars maybe could have been there for a long time before but, we just didnt descover it till now. People dont know how large space really is. They just know what people till them or what they have discovered, but why would aliens really exsist? Some people say there is life on all planest and we are not looking hard enough. Even if there were life on diffrent planents why would we just be hearing about it now and not sooner. What the picture actually showa is the Martian equivqlent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West. The people of America and of this great nation dont need to be consirned about if we can defend then aginst an extra terresteral attack. Also, we dont know what knid of weapons they have or if they have powers or anything about them. We don't know there weeknesses or strenths.

20834,0,"The advantages of limiting car usage are less air pollution. Less smog would be intensifying in other countries. more people would be released from the stress of owning a car people wouldnt have to worry about gas prices. The rate of car accidents would go down and so would the percentage of deaths caused by car accidents. more money would be saved since less people wont have to worry about spending any money repairing their vehicles or tuning them up. Crime rates would decrease since less ppl would be able to commit crimes without a car,and no one could have their car stolen from them. Teen deaths caused by drunk driving would decrease as well. The cost of emissions would go down imensly and the U.S would gain alot more money because of less money spent on vehicles and and imports and gas,oil,tires and other vehicle related cost expenses. Limiting car usage is one of the best possible thing U.S American citizens can do to help preserve our earth and its enviorment. It is best if everyone start to limit their car usage so that our planet can be less polluted and can be smog free. Cars are one of the biggest reasons for air pollution and we spend alot of money and them aswell. So i believe car usage should be limited for the greater good of our earth."
377,0,"In ""The challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author gives alot of examples and support on why venus should be explored. Although the dangers might be to dangerous for anyone to physically be on it, the author shows how we can avoid making contact on the planet and how we could gather information of the planet. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author gives us many examples on how NASA can study Venus without being harmed. The author mentions all of the dangers Venus comes with. For example, the author mentions the atmosphere being 97 percent carbon dioxide. (paragragh 3 line 1). In this case the crew on the ship will have to be very careful because if they are exposed to the carbon dioxide in the atomosphere, they will suffocate to death. Another danger the author mentions is the planets surface tempeture and the atmospheric pressure. The surface is 800 degree's Fahrenheit and the stmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on Earth. These dangers are very serious and will be very harmful if any human comes in contact with it. After naming all of the dangers Venus presents, the author gives many examples on how to solve the issues. In the story, the author supports his idea of studying venus by listing examples on how to avoid the dangers. For example, he mentions how NASA is compelling an idea for humans to study Venus. NASA's compromise is to allow scientists to float above the planet. The author gives us readers a mental picture by having us imagine the scientists floating about the surface of Venus studying the atmosphere and the surface itself. The author lists how the scientists would feel in the blimp like vehicle icluding the tempeture and pressure level but states they would be able to survive the climate. NASA is also working on some electronics to withstand the pressure and heat of Venus. For example, NASA has made elctronics out of silicon carbide, which has been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface, that can withstand the climate for three weeks. That would be enough time to gather the information the scientists need and return the gadgets home safely. Another project is looking back at old technology called mechanical computers. These computers were used in the 1940's during World War II. These computors are ran by gears and levers and does not require any other electronics. This importanat computer can be very helpful because it can withstand the heat and pressure in the atmospher of Venus. These examples can help persude other scientists to want to do research on Venus and not be effected by the other dangers. In conclusion, the author showed me that studying Venus is worthy enough to study. The author lists many percautions on how to prepare for the rough climate the scientists will face. The examples the author gives on how NASA is working on getting scientists on venus with new technology is phenaminal. The author gives us a life lesson by stating that dangers in the world should not hold anyone back and that people need to get out and explore. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author gives the readers many examples on how NASA can study Venus without being harmed."
6277,0,"Computers in classrooms have always been helpful, and theres still room for more. I think that schools should have a few of these computers in the classroom. When a student gets confused they will shut down, or just get distracted or loose interest, but if we had one of these computers then we would be able to know the student is falling behind before they give up. The compter would be able to know when a student is either confused, or bored. Dr huang says that the computer would also be able to ""modify the lesson like a human instructor."" This would be valuable because if students are happier, and their grades are going up from this, eveyone would be better off. These computers could help teachers, schools, and students tremendously increase performance. A teacher can't always tell if a student is confused, but the computer can, and then the teacher can help. These computers could change the way studemts view school. Students could like the computers, their facial expressions being read by a computer to alert the teacher when needed, or when they just do not understand something. One thing that all three of those have in commin is that, Theyre helpful, which to me means they are valuable."

As stated in paragraph six it says. They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalls had to be cleaned. Another reason you should try this program is because it is very big opporuntinity. You get to see the world. You get to know what it is like at sea. Maybe you might like it. And decide that you want to do it for a living on your own ship. It says in paragraph nine. ""Im grateful for the opportunity,"" he says.

21229,0,"The Electoral College has its pros and cons. Either keeping the Electoral College or changing it to election by popular vote for the presidents of the U.S. will have its disadvantages and advantages of course. So, why keep it if the people don't actually pick the president? One of the reasons why the Electoral College should be changed is because its not Democratic. The voters don't vote for the president, they actually vote for a slate of electors who are the ones who elect the president. ""Because of the winner-take all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states"" - by Bradford Plumer. Its not fair that some states won't even have a saying in choosing the president. Everyone should have a saying even if the candidates in the winner-take all system don't want to spend their time. We live in a democratic country we should be allowed to choose the persident instead of the Electoral College. Its unfair and irrational that the electors choose the president instead of the people. The Electoral College does help the elections avoid Run-Off Elections. Larger states will always get more attention in a campaign than a small state. This is because larger states have a bigger population than small states.""The most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election"". -by Richard A. Posner. Just because not everyone pays close attention to the competing campaign. It doesn't been they shouldn't be treated differently than the ones who do. Everyone should be treated equally no matter what there opinion or choice is. My opinion about if we should keep or change the Electoral College is biased. I don't think we should keep or even change it for the president to be elected by a populr vote. The electoral college helps weight the political balance in large states. It also doesn't allow the people to vote for the president. Either way i would be fine with whatever decision happens to the electoral college. I can't chose a way to argue about it cause i go both ways with my arguements. In overal the Electoral College has its advantages and disadvantages. It all depends in everyones point of view. People should be treated equally about the decision they made. Let the people be able to choose the president of the United States its a right they have don't take it away from them because it wouldn't be fair to them. We live in a democratic country and the people have the power."
8917,0,"The new technology called the ""Facial Coding Sytem""is the best technology ever. It has a veriety of features like the 3-D model,the recognizition emotion face,annd the math homework app. The 3-D model is one way why people should choose this technology because if you have a 3-D model computer then everything looks big and clear. This proves that now and days people like to watch thing and look at things big and clear. So that is why you should take this technology. The recognize emotion is another reason why this is a nice technology. For example,this shows how you feel or the way you expressions look. The author says,""Using video imagery,the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements-in real life or in the painted face of Mona Lisa.""This proves that the facial emotion can work on anything whether is a person or a picture of someone. The math homework is the last reason why you should buy this technology. In fact this is also a part of the emotion senser like whether if you feel like doing it or not. For examle,in the text it says,""Hold on! Can we actually calculate emotions-like mathwork.""This proves that the technology can tell if we want to do something or not. Emotion in the new technology can really determine a person. In conclusion,The emotion,homework and 3-D computer are the best features to have on a technology and people would love it too if they had want to get one."
5999,0,"This idea i think is very usefull for teachers now, its bad enough we cant understand a persons mood. It is bad because someone could be sad or angry but the person wont say anything to get it out of his or her system. If we had this system it would be great to know wether a student is okay, fine or depressed. The fact that we already know six characterisitc movements means that we can probably find more. The six basic emotions are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness. The bad things about the emotion detecting system is that it could mess up some how and it would tell the teacher that this kid is sad but he is happy. The machine could be really expensive and schools wouldnt even be interested in buying these systems. The system could probably pick up other emotions that are not propriate and the kid would feel embarrased. Why would a teacher really want this system anyways. Overall i think this machine is beneficial to schools everywhere in the United States. The system sounds like it will be because of how much knowlege u know from a student because of there emotional look. This can be great for the student also, to let him know that that the section he just read was boring or fun. I think this emotion system will be great for every school in the future."
24650,0,"Dear, Mr. President I need to get something off my chest, we need to change the way we the people vote. An Electoral college isn't the right way to do it anymore. We need to change to the peoples popular vote. Because this is a country for the people, we aren't voting for the president, and because electoral vote just isnt't fair. Mr. President the first reason why we should change the popular vote is because this country is supposed to be for the people and in an electoral vote it's not. In the electoral vote its about the government and who they want as president and alot of people DO NOT like that. People of the United States of America should be able to vote and pick who they as a president of there country. It should be our right as Americans to be able to pick our own president not a bunch of old smart people in suits in Congress. I under stand that there is 538 as it says in the article What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register, but their is more than 300 million Americans. So techinically we aren't even voting for you. Which brings me to my next reason, we aren't even voting for the president. When there is an Electoral college we are voting for the slate of electors in congress that will vote for the president as it says in the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the systems are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer. So like I said before a bunch of old men and old women are they taking our votes away from us. For example, in 2000 Al Gore would've won the election but because the electoral vote beat him. He had the popular vote of the people but says the congress chose other wise he lost the election. According to the same article as it says above. Over 60% of people rather people's popular vote other the electoral vote. Last but definetely not least, the electoral college just isn't fair at all. Maybe it's fair for the government befoore they can basically just pick the president that they want, but it's supposed to be a country for the people. It says it in the Constitution We The People not We The Government. Also the winner takes all system, the candidates don't pay attention to the smaller states they just look and the big states like California, Florida, or New York. So technically they are cheating the electoral college because they don't pay attention to all the elected slates of those small states. According to the article "" The Indefesible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the sytem are wrong"" by Braford Plumer. In Conclusion, Mr. President if you care about what the people want you would abolish the Electoral college. Because this is a country for the people, we aren't even voting for the president, and because it's just not fair. It needs to be changed to the popular vote. I've been waiting to get that off my chest for a while. Yours Truly, PROPER_NAME P.s: I hope you read this and take off the electoral college."
13728,0,"25 years ago something happened that made headlines for magazines and newpapers it was also talked about on the radio. There has been a picture taken and sent back to NASA and apears to be a face on mars. Working as a scientist at NASA. I truley believe that this is just another thing people freak out about and soon to realize it was nothing. Let me explain to you what it really is or what I believe it to be. In 1976 a picture was taken and people believed it was ""aliens"" that someone that is not human make a structure and make a face on mars. 1998 another picture was taken of the same face and it looked more clear. The ""face on mars"" doesn't really look like a face anymore. There are still people talking about because of one single picture to look at. In 2001 another picture was taken and this time it looks more like a hill or a platue type structure. People still want to believe it was aliens because they like the whole alien thing and want to stand out. As a working scientist in NASA I think that this is just a hill or something we have on earth. Something nature and not made by aliens. I think this because anythink can seen something it is not. Like for an example the picture that looks like a face has to do with shadow and perspective. If we were to take another picture with the sun facing a different way. The illution of the face would be not there. It's like loooking at a cloud and you see a face or a object we have seen before. It's still a cloud,but it looks that way because the shape and the position we are standing at. This is why I think it's just another hill that has some shadows and the illution of a face. In conclution this face on mars is something not to be freaking out about. It's something that seens what it is not. There are many things on this world that you can look at and say ""oh that looks like face"" and when you look at it longer you realize its nothing. You dont hear people talking about this today in 2016 becuase it is one of those things you hear and forget because it turned out to be really just a hill with illution. This is my reasons why I think that its not a face or it is not alien activity."
21814,0,The Electoral College vote draws many emotions. It has many supporters and many enemies. There was a huge debate over the 2000 election where Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College. I believe that the Electoral College destroys some of the integrity of the Ameican democracy. I believe this is due to the winner takes all system of the Electoral College. The Electoral College says whoever has the majority of votes in a state recieves all that states votes. I believe this corrupts the system because so many peoples votes go unaccounted. If one party has 51 percent of the vote the other 49 percent of the votes don't count. This is why I believe that we need to abloish the Electoral College. In a true democracy the people vote for a president and the ideal behind the Electoral College is that it eliminates uneducated votes. I believe that it doesn't do this very well and may actually harm the system even more. Peoples votes elect electors who elect the President in the Electoral College system. These electors are put in a spot of significant power. The question is who are these electors. It is very possible that they can vote for the opposite party of that which they were elected to vote for. Scandals like this have occured in the past what is stopping them form continueing in the future. Another major problem of the Electoral College is with the winner takes all system if a state is known to be a majority one party or another there is no use for someone in the minority party to vote because they have no effect. This allows citizens who are supposed to help elect Americas leaders to be unable to have any say in the goverment. The ideal behind a democracy is that the people rule and the Electoral College is destroying the democracy because it is restricting people form taking active particiapation in what they are entiltled too as a citizen. Without the Electoral College there might be some uneducated votes but the popular vote upholds the integrity of the democracy that America thrives on. The popular vote also eliminates the chance of any major scandals that could majorly affect the presedintial election.

But recently we have been cutting back on the usage of cars and we could extend the life of our planet by simply not driving. Transportation is the second largest source of America's emmisions and it caused Paris to ban driving for a little while due to smog, environmental conditions worsen by the day and it is apparent. Yet we still drive our fancy cars around like there isn't a problem. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emmisions in Europe and up to 50 percent in the U.S."" states Elisabeth Rosethal from the article ""In German Suburb Life goes on without cars."" That is a lot of pollution entering our atmosphere. Americans and other citizens around the world have increasingly recognized this problem and started taking the initiative to change it. In Bogota, Colombia one day out of the year all cars are banned except taxi's and busses. ""Violaters faced 25 dollar fines... but the turnout was large, despite the gray clouds that dumped rain showers"" Andrew Skelsky says from the article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota.""

This is important because is telling us how Venus conditions are far more extreme than anything humans can encounter. Another important point that makes Venus hard to study is the weather. In paragraph 3 the author says ""Beyong hig pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequesnt lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface"" (Paragraph 3). This is important because Venus having earthquakes, volcanoes and frequent lightning strikes makes it very hard for someone to go there to study it. Lastly studying Venus is challenging because researchers can't take any samples of Venus from a distance. In paragraph 6 the author says "" Rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risk. Or maybe we should think of them as challenges."" (Paragraph 6). This is important because not being able to take samples of rocks, gas or anything from Venus makes it very hard on scientists to find out forms of getting to Venus without having anyone in danger. Finally, exploring Venus is challenging and dangerous."
4681,0,"Is the FACS (known as the Facial Action Coding System) a good idea to read the emotional expessions of students in a classroom valuable? I agree that it is, the reason why I agree to that cause it can help students show their emotions when they are scared to, and in the future it can really come in handy. The reason why it can help students show their emotions when they are scared to is that because what if a student is in class and they are sad but they just don't wanna say or tell someone, well from the FACS it can show when the perosn is sad. In the text it shows that from this new technology it can really come in handy in the future by the more we use it and explore with it, it can help with us by first making animated videos, like in games, movies, short films etc. that would come in handy cause by then things will be really easy. In conclusion to my side is that I think its a good idea to start spreading the FACS around this will do good in the future and we can't make it good if we don't explore and make it spread cause i'm for sure know that this will be good for our society maybe for the whole world."

This could be a big part of our futures but whether it will help our future drivers or hurt them is the main importance. Personallly I do not think that driverless cars are going to do more harm than good to our furture drivers. Today to get your drivers lisence you have to hold a permit for one-hundred eighty days and have to pass a writen test followed by a driving portion of the test with an instructor. These conditions you have to follow to be able to drive a normal car are intense because you are being put onto a road that could potientionally harm another humans life or your own life. The precautions you have to take are endless while driving and the risk you are putting yourself in is immense. Having driverless cars where you still have to be in control part of the time just causes an even bigger distraction especially for younger, newer drivers. You could be talking and suddenly have to stop manually and not have enough time to make it there, because you were distracted by something else. Another reason that driverless cars have a negative effect on the future is the economy. To make a normal car cost a lot of money but to make a driverless car would cost twice that or more because of the type of technology you would need to use to make them run proporley. Having normal cars puts your life into harms way and teens are bad enough when it comes to staying focused, being attentive,and staying cautious with normal cars. By putting teens behind the wheel of cars that uses a computer, or a controling device to run it, is teaching them nothing but pure laziness, not to focus your one hundred percent attention, and to stay alert when it comes to driving. Driving is a very serious matter that people already abuse laws and regulations for. To give people another excuse to why the accident happened or to why they wrecked into a pole should not come from our local car dealerships and manufacturers. We together as a community need to stop the driving problems directly and not give people more advanced technology, just so they have another excuse as to why an accident occured."
2631,0,"Studying venus is a worthy pursuit depsite the dangers it presents, because if you think about it venus is like the brightest light in the sky and also the second plannet from our sun. The article talks a lot on venus, from trying to see why spacecrafts didn't stay up there long, how could they fix that, and many more. Studying venus won't be bad, you could learn a lot from it, probably things you didn't already know. In the text it states "" Previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason,....... no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours"". If you was to study venus, you could probably figure out why a lot of spacecrafts don't last up there. Despite all the bad stuff that happens on venus you could always look at the good side, like features. It's not always about the bad part of stuff it's the good part and what makes it good. In the story it states""...... Venus was probably covered largely with oceas and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth.Today, venus still has some features that are analogous to those on earth"". So if you was to study venusv which is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers, you can think about the good part and you could probably change why spacecrafts don't last or anything else that's wrong,but you should never let the danger stop you from learning something good."
16536,0,"I believe in driverless cars. Driverless cars are the next big leap into transportation. Throughout the past there has been major leaps in transportation such as aviation, cars and trains. Although its not entirly a new thing it could become the next step to having easyier lives. But would it? In the artical it states that new laws would have to be made in order to accomidate the driverless vehicals. They would have to change due to the unfortunate event of an accident or a collision. That could all be taken care of in a court of law but as safty issues go, what happens if the car malfunctions on the freeway or innerstate? This could very well happen but I supect that it will be a very rare occurance. The benifits however outweigh the issues. Just some of the many benifits are less accidents, safer driving condtions, and most likely no traffic. Selfdriving cars don't need a driver so that means more free time for the person woam would have been driving. In the artical it adress the factor of boredom. Stating that entertainment systems would be put into place preventing a passanger from being board. The artical also adresses how states will not allow driverless cars to even be out and about. I suspect when all issues are ironed out and flaws are to a minum those laws will be dead. The only laws that need to be put into place would be if an accident occurs or a colission were to happen. As of traffic there would be a significantly decreased amout due to no accidents,and no random breaking. Not only would they not have accidnets but they would be able to travel at faster speeds and no crash. Meaning that a person would get there safe and faster than they would have been able to. Finally the benifit of not owning a car. You may not realize it but owning a vehical is very expensive. Some of the expences are fuel, insurance, the actual car, maintence, ect. But if there were driverless cars then it would be just like a taxi servce but with no driver, ariving at the destination faster, and not having to deal with an accident. However that is ways away and selfdriving cars still have quite a ways to go. All in all I completely agree with having a selfdriving car. Even though they may have some down falls I believe that they will redeem themselfs in the near future. And I look forward to not have to drive myself and enjoy my free time."

While Venus does might be easy to get there to some people, the author does talk about how it will still be very hard no matter what. like how the author talks about how an ""amateur stargazer can spot Venus on most days."" Humans are not wanting to see it in the sky by to really look at it but the auther explains that ""it has been proven a very challenging place to examine more closely these days. Venus, often referred to as the Earth's ""twin,"" because ""Venus is the clostest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distace too."" The auther explains that ""Earth, Venus, and Mars are our planetary neighbors."" and ""how humans s have sent numerous spacecraft to land on the cloud-draped world."" Venus also have some cons also because, ""no spacecraft survived the landing for more then a few hours."" The auther explains that it could be deadly for humans to try to land on the planet Venus, and how ""it has been taking humans more then three decades"" to study and land on Venus. The other many reason way there are ""Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challening planet for humans to study, despite proxmity to us, as the author explain to us in the story. The study of Venus has been look at by NASA for many years, ""They have been thinking about sending humans to study Venus"" The auther explain's the plain that ""NASA many have possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus that would allow scientists to float above the fray."" The reason why it is so hard to get to venus or get on the suface is because, ""most of the time jet planes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms"". Flying to venus, over Venus, or flying on venus surface humans would have to deal with the ""unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way.""

The auther explains that no matter what Earth and Venus are very close in some forms and in other forms not even close but in the end they are still both planets.

11203,0,"I believe that the face is just a natural landform. There are no facts to prove that aliens created that. Also there are also no facts to prove aliens didnt make that landform on Mars. I will still continue to believe that it is just a natural landform created by the planet Mars in earlier years. I can prove my arguement in many ways. For example, it states in the text that "" And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Vikings photo. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting, when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform"". Just that last sentence alone can make my arguement 10 times better. That statement proves to us it was just a natural landform. In addition to this, in the article it states "" there was no alien monument after all."". Which tells us there was never alien monument and that never was made by aliens. As you can see in the picture, it looks pretty old. Which should really show everyone something. The photo as taken in 1976. With our newer, more advanced cameras it shows that its just a natural landform on Mars. In the article it states that "" As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" he added ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pryamids or even small shacks, you can see wwhat they were!"". Which means if we really wanted to, we can capture a picture of the so called ""face"" or natural landform. Also then we would be able to prove what it is and what it is not. There are many other reasons why this arguement can be won by either side, but there is never a true answer until someone goes onto the planet Mars and takes a look at the face or landform in person. in fact, I will always stand my ground and say it is just a natural landform on Mars."
17230,0,"Driving cars is something we all have wanted to see. And now knowing that they might actually be invented is something many people are excited about. There are so many questions about these newly invented cars. How do they work? Are they safe? What will happen to the cars we are using now? Many people are wondering the same questions. After reading the article ""Driverless Cars are Coming"" I disagree and am not for the idea of driverless cars because people enjoy driving, many companies will be out of busniess, you will still have to drive, and they aren't super safe. First off, there are many people in the world that enjoy driving. When teenagers turn 16 one of the first things they want to do is get their license and drive. Driving is something that everyone wants to be able to do. But if we have cars that drive themselves, teenagers will never need to know how to drive. And I am sure many of them would be upset. Yes, in the article is does say that the driver will need to take over but for only certain situations. ""This means that human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" So many people will loose the enjoyment of driving, and only be able to drive in those particular situations. In addition, there are people that enjoy sitting there and driving. And if we have self driven cars they will not be able to do that. Instead, the car will drive its self while the human just sits there. Many people will be upset with the fact they won't be able to drive any more. Futhermore, what will happen to all the companies and busniesses that have to do with the cars we have now? Including gas stations, car autoshops, drivers ed, and mechanic shop? Will all of these places just shut down and leave thousands of people without jobs? Since the new cars drive themselves there would be no need for drivers ed anymore. That would leave all the drivers ed places out of busniess. Secondly what would happen to the cars that we are driving now? Would everyone have to stop using them and go to the ""driverless car"" or could people still us the same car they have know? In the article it says ""The track was embedded with electrical cable that sent radio signals to the reciever on the front end of the car."" This makes me wonder would we need new roads with this electrical cable embedded in it, because that would leave to even more problems. In addition, these cars aren't fully finished and safe. The driverless cars they are making aren't fully driveless they still need the driver to be alert. So what's the fun in driving a ""Driverless car"" when its not completely driverless? When you think of driverless you think that the driver can be doing whatever he/she watns and doesn't need to be worried about drivng. However that's not the case, the still have to be alert. So the driver will have to stop the activity they are doing, and take over driving when the car needs it to. "" Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over."" These displays were if the driver was watching a movie, or any other entertainment. But, if I was in the middle of something, and was interrupted and had to stop and take control of the car, I would not be happy. And I am sure many others wouldn't be happy either. And who knows how frequent the car is going to need you to take over. If you were planning on getting something done in the car, you might not be able to if you keep getting interupted. Lastly, how safe are these cars? No where in the article does it say that these cars are extraordinary safe compared to the cars that we have now. So it makes me wonder, do I really trust a car to be in control of my life. No, especially if it says that the driver might need to take over at certian times. That makes me think that there could be some malfunctions in this car, and risking my life for it would not be worth it. Not only would I be risking my life, but the others on the streets as well. The quesiton also comes up, who's fault would it be ""If the system fails and a person gets hurt whos fault would it be? "" Technology is known to have its flaws and that is something that could risks lives. I would not feel safe giving 100% of my trust to a piece of technology. Especially since there is no proof to how safe they really are. In conclusion, I am not ready for the ""driverless cars"". There is still so much work that needs to be done to make these cars safer and actually drive themselves. Many people still want to be able to drive, and if everyone switches to driverless cars then people won't be able to drive anymore. Also, so many companies would go out of busniess due to this drastic change in the car company, including drivers ed places. The driverless cars aren't actaully driverless which I'm sure will make people mad. The driver will still need to be alert, but not actually driving. These cars aren't exactly safe either, there is still a big chance about a malfunction. I'm sure people would be as hesistant as I would be if I went in one of these cars. Overall, innovations and inventions are great but sometimes its best to just stick with what we got. And in this case I think the cars we have now are perfectly fine, and don't need to be changed."
6013,0,"Facial codeing is it useful? Technology is it really advanced enough to know whether or not someone is happy? Is the way we are suppose to look when angry the way to judge somebody, what if it's there natural face? would somebody take offense if they drew a drawling that was suppose to be happy but the computer said it was only 64 percent happy?i know i would now let me tell you what i think. Technology is really cool don't get me wrong i think technology is the greatest invention in this world. But i believe we all know the fact that technology can get really expensive and for really stupid reasons So, i am going against this and here's why. How this works is the computer takes a face into a 3-D model and there are suppose to be 44 muscles that move. In paragraph three there's is a part that says ""For example, your frontails pars lateralis muscle (above your eye) raises your eyebrows when you're surprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger"". Now your probably saying ok why are you against it, because not everyones eybrows move when they're surprised. Personally my eyebrows also move when im really tired, nervouse buzzed out on nicotine or simply when i have the jitter bugs becaus im scared and shaking. ""she's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disguisted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"". This is where the role play of me not aggree with this comes in, i honestly feel like the computer is throwing numbers at you we cant be accurate. and even if we were there doing this on scientifically how the muscle should look which is a lot of bull crap to me. ""Yet Dr. Huang observes that artist such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions"". So, right there we can see yeah he may be able to get pretty damn close but im sorry da Vinci just being close isn't enough for me you would have to be right on the dot. I get it's not going to be a perfect 100 pecent happy but how do we know it's 83 percent. Why cant't it be a 73 percent or a 65 yeah i get all of there percents add up to 100% but how do we not know the computer is just not being lazy and picking the easiest numbers to add. For examp they could do 75 percent happy, 12 percent disgusted, 10 percetn fearful and 3 percent that's how i see mona lisa in the picture. or it could even be something along the lines of 75 percent happy, 12 percent disgusted, 6 percent angry, and then 7 percent angry. I dont know if any of this made my point come across but here's my point. everyone will look at this picture or anyother picture and everyone will think differently of it you wont have a right or wrong answer. just like everyone will have a right or wrong answer about this form of technology. we could look at grandpa joe and say damn he looks very upset and angry he doesnt want to be here. but maybe in all reality thats just his face. Grandpa could be happier then you although you probably arn't happy grading all of these test. So, my final answer is im against this technology i think it would be a waste of money thank you."
13609,0,"Switching Sides Have you ever heard of the man on the moon? Well Mars has a similar thing. They both,at the time, had formations that looked like human faces. Some think it was made by aliens or some other superior being. However, the reality of it is that its just a natural formation that looks like a face. That part can be nocked out when you zoom up on it. The lines and basic formation of the mesa,the face, are too natural to be made by an intelligent species. Finally, if there was some marks or sign that it was created by aliens it would have shown up on the image due to the high resolution. We are looking farther then we should with this natural formation. At the moment the most recent picture from 2001 completly exterminates any facial recognition. You can see natural lines that run across the mesa and the higher elevation of certian areas. The eyes are just a steep hill that geos to the top. While the mouth seemingly isn't even there anymore. You can see the worn away parts indicating that its been there for quite awhile. The shadows aren't even there at the time which creates the distictive features. It bearly even looks like a face anymore. I was talking about the NATURAL lines that appear on the mesa. The lines on the mesa are to distictive to be created. If something made it they would have wanted smooth edges as well as an even ditch. If they tried to recreate the natural look it would have looked faulty and unbeliveable. The species would have completly deformed the hill exposing its true colors. Also what reason would they have for creating a random face with the possibility of no one ever seeing it. There is no point to it. Finally, the final reason for it not being alien-made is if there was marking on the mesa giving reason to believe it was created be aliens they would have been shown. If any wierd symbols showed up on the screen we would have seen it and still release the image. Why would we hide this from the world if it would increase the amount of funding we get from companies. You can study the image for hours, but not find a single symbol anywere on the image. The camera would have picked it up and we would have studied it. The mesa was not created by aliens if only looks that way to us because are minds are hardwired to find faces. Its much easier to remember a face rather than a name. Everything about the image is natural it wasn't put there for some unnoticable reason that we can't comprehend. It just existis thats all... nothing more nothing less. No aliens had anything to do with this mesa."
4473,0,"""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is about the studies that have been done on Venus and why scientists feel those studies are so valuable to our furture.Our planet Earth provides a safe tempature and oxygen enviroment for human life. However, even though Venus and Earth are close neighbors, Venus is not safe for humans to live in. Scientists continue to learn more and more about this planet to get as much information as possible. One of the major reasons Venus is studied so often is that it is closest planet to earth in terms of density and size. With Venus having such a thick atmosphere thats mostly made of carbon dioxide, and deadly temperatures over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, It is not able to allow any human life to remain on it. The weather on Venus also pose some issues including: volcanoes, and lightning. Scientist have sent normerous un-maned spacecrafts to explore Venus. With most of these trips resulting in damaged or losts spacecrafts, Astronomeres managed to learn alot about the Planets history commpanded to the way it is now and also compared to our planet Earth. This type of information can be very useful. Astronomeres belive that long ago, Venus might not have been much different than Earth. They think that it had large oceans and could suport life. Still to this day, Venus contains a rocky surface made of sediment very similar to Earth. Along with things like valleys, mountians, and craters. The value of having a second planet safe for humans is rather large, but making the trip now is impossible due to the deadly conditions on Venus. NASA formed an idea on how to make a safe travel to Venus that includes floating above the fray. A vehicle hovering over Venus would allow the ship to avoid the dangerous atmosphere. Despite being thirty miles above the planets surface, tempertures would still reach a boiling 170 degrees Farhrenheit. The air pressure however, is safe and livable for humans. With alot of work and research still needed to be done on Venus, people at NASA and other companies are still striving to make life on the mysterious planet Venus possible in future years to come."
7692,0,"What is the value of a smile? For most of us, it is simply a way to express your feelings. But in the future, we may be using smiles and other facial expressions to help others learn. This is because of a new technology, the Facial Action Coding System, that ""tracks these facial movements"" (D'Alto 4). It uses a computer algorithm to monitor the emotions of people, then it can reveal how exactly the person is feeling based off ""movement of one or more muscles"" (D'Alto 3). It may seem far fetched, but use of this technology has the possibility of improving the classroom experience for millions of children around the world. The use of this FACS technology in the classroom revolves around adapting lesson plans as they are being taught. Thomas Huang, a professor at the University of Illinois, said, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" (D'Alto 6). His logic makes sense, and implementing this technology could have a profound impact on students around the world. Think of all the children who struggle because of the pace or difficulty of a class. Those children may not have the financial resources for a tutor or the willingness to ask the teacher. But by using this technology to address confusion, the students' understanding of the content will strengthen. However, the benefits don't stop at the children. Teachers all around the world can improving their educating methods by interpreting the data of their students. A teacher who is using this technology may see that 75% of her/his students made confused faces when confronted with problem #7 on the homework. The teacher may choose to review that subject the next day with all of her/his students. Also, the use of this technology could lead to a more enjoyable classroom experience. There are many positives with being aware of a student's confusion. But several advantages may also arise from being aware of their boredom. If most students in a classroom understand a subject, but are bored with it, the teacher may see this data and choose to move on to new material. This avoids wasting time on content that the students are proficient in, and increases the morale of the students. Learning a new exciting topic may give energy to these students. Looking back at all of the benefits of utilizing this technology, it would be reasonable to say that FACS has the potential to benefit schools around the globe if used correctly. Implementing FACS in schools can lead to higher student morale, more proficient student comprehension, and an overall more enjoyable school experience. Students can be guided back on to the right track when they begin to get confused. Students can also be pushed a little bit harder when things begin to become too easy. Eliminating confusion and promoting enjoyable learning can have profoud effects on schools. These would become schools filled with students that love to learn. If FACS were to see these smiling faces, it would deduce that the subjects are ""100 percent happy."""
1439,0,"Venus is a well-known or maybe to some well - heard of planet in our solar system. It's also known as the ""Evening Star."" NASA has a ""particularly compelling idea"", for sending humans to study Venus, as the reader may notice from the text. We are told that Venus may have some interesting things being discovered that may lead to new studies. It's dangerous and takes caution, but is it worth it? As the reader can tell from the text, the author states mutliple reasonings for why it would be worth it for humans to do such studies on Venus. One of those might be for the fact that Venus is often reffered to as Earth's ""twin."" This is because Venus is the closest planet to Earth within being of terms in density and size. Plus, it's super close to Earth so it's one of Earth's closest ""neighbors."" It's found within the text also that Venus may have contained bodies of water such as Oceans and who knows, maybe lakes here and there. Due to the planets' surface of rocky sediment, it's possible that there were familiar features sich as valleys, mountains, and craters. It is said that maybe once there has been or maybe still is some form of life on our neighboring planet. Another thing that ties into why it would be worth the study is that what if we could send humans to maybe live on Venus? It's definitely a work in progress due to temperatures going to around 170 degrees Fahrenheit. Surviving human lives on Venus wouldn't be easy due to these conditions but that is why NASA is digging deeper into what can be done to make it suitable for human lives. Though one other thing shared with the reader is that the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth, which is a holdback but it's of course possible for adaptation in the right conditions which need to be discovered. If it's possible that other forms of life lived on Venus then why not humans too? The third reason for studying Venus being worthy is that human curiosity can lead to an endorsement of new ideas. Of course that is why NASA is such a thing. The way our bodies work have been in discovery for years and years. Which leads to the idea that if we can figure out how and why our bodies function in certain conditons on Earth, how could and would our bodies function on a planet that is closest to features alike the sun. These reasons explain to the reader why the author might believe that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers; because, who else is to make these discoveries and what if NASA were to find information that could help us learn a bit more about our own planet. Plus, more about the human life can be something that we learn more and more about. And lastly, who's to say that curoisity killed the cat? Well of course it's everyone; but, with new studies and leads we can figure out how curiosity saved the ""cat"" and taught that ""cat"" new things."
13690,0,"Joining the Seagoing Cowboys group was one of the most greatest accomplishments I have ever made. If you choose to do something in your life, it should be becoming a Seagoing Cowboy. I have some very good points on why you should join. The first and main reason is this program helps people. It supports people's horses, young cows, and mules, since this program is for those who are struck by natural disasters or for wars that have taken place where they live. It also supports the animals living space. The cowboys must feed and water the animals 2 to 3 times a day, the men have to haul oats and hay from the lower holds of the ship, and they have to clean the animals stalls. the second reason is that if you turn 18 while on a Seagoing trip and you get drafted, this counts as your service to the military. The last reason is when you are going to these countries you have these gorgeous and unique places to visit and sightsee. I have seen the Acropolis in Greece, the streets of Italy from the lake on a gondola ride, and I have even seen the Panama Canal on my way to China. If you become a Seagoing Cowboy then you can experience and support all three of these reasons."
2477,0,"What you think about Venus? Think we should study more? Venus is the second planet in the solar system and it's close to Earth and Mercury. Venus is sometimes called the "" Evening Star "" and it's one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. I say we should study one planet per unit in science class. In case a student wants to be in the NASA, they can study bout each planet and they can know whats coming. In paragraph 2 it states "" Each mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for human to study, despite its proximity to us."" The author is explaining details on why we should study Venus. If anoyone lands on Venus they won't survive much because they won't last more than few hours. Most spacecraft and spaceships need a lot of hours to be able to discover more about Venus. In paragraph 3 it states "" Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even thought Mercury is closer to our sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like eruping volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface."" This states one reaons why spacecraft and spaceships wouldn't last a few hours on Venus. It is very hot their skin can probably melt down very quick or once they touch Venus their spaceship can melt or not work anymore and they won't be able to go back to Earth. While people are studying about the planet can always find out something new about it. They can find out stuff about the old times or what that planet had long ago, or whats going happen to it, and etc. In paragraph 4 it states that "" Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with ocean and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, moutains, and craters."" This demonstrates how the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents and how the author supports the idea. Still think we should study Venus? I still agree with the author that we should study Venus but I say we should study one planet per unit."
12084,0,"I am fully against the development of the driverless cars. It is dangerous and unrealiable in so many ways. Here is why I am against driverless car: Driverless cars may look and sound cool but it is really not safe for anyone to drive. I understand that the car alerts the driver when they need to drive but what if that technology gets destroyed? Then what? The car doesn't know when to switch lanes and how to dodge potholes in the middle of the street. The driver sees all of that. The driver sees when there is going to be trouble on the street. The driver sees when there is a stop sign or when there is a little boy crossing the street.The car doesn't see any of that.So many unrealiable things can happpen when driving. New things happen everyday on the road.Humans need to be in full controll of the car for the safety of their lives and others.Dribers will be able to act faster then the car will in a dangerous situation. Drierless cars can sometimes be unrealiable as well as dangerous. What if the technology in the car freezes or what if it just stops completely for no reason? Will the car still be able to function right? teh text says that ""If the technology fails and someone is injured,who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?""I fully agree with this sentence. I also disagree with the development of the driveless cars because of the driver. The driver might get so comfortable with not driving that they either fall asleep or get distracted while the car is doing all the work. With the cars we have now, the driver is forced to pay attention to their surroundings avoiding accidents. the driver might even get into sn accident and blame in on the manufacturer when really they weren't paying attention. The cars we have as of today force us to pay attention but with driverless car there is less of an attention span of the people. Driverless cars are such a huge distraction and can cause lots of trouble. Driverless cars look cool and may actually be cool for a short period of time but will risk the lives of many people.Would you rather drive a cra and have a high chance at being safe or would you switch to driverless cars to look cool and to have a lower risk of being safe?"
22511,0,"Dear State Senator As it may have come to yourn notice I would like to foucus your attention to the debate about the Electoral Collage. The Electoral Collage is a unfair process the fathers of the Constintution established. As you know it is a ""Compromise between electon of the President by a vote in Congress and eletion of the President by popular vote."" (Source 1) In other words the Electorial Collage is where we elect represintives to vote for the president. That then makes their vote more important then everyone elses. And let me tell you, you wouldnt want that. The Electoral Collage was a structure our founding fathers set up to help formally elect the president. But if this process goes aginst the wishes of the people, the ones the Constitution was writen for, then what purpose does it serve? "" Its official: The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" (Source 2) Once the Electoral Collage has be abolished the president can then be elected by popular vote and every one will be satisfided. ""The Electoral College is widely regarded as a anashronism"" (Sourse 3) This means that the Electoral Collage is a thing that seems to belong in the past and does not fit in the present. Im sure that our founding fathers had good intions when they installed this system into our goverment. But times has changed since then,and we need to abolish the Electoral Collage so we can have a simpler system that almost every one agrees with.

Car ownership however is not forbidden but there are only two places to park in large garages on the edge of the developement. A media trainer and mother of two spoke about her details of this new rule, she stated she is much happier without a car. This will give children around a better enviroment to grow up in because everyone without cars will be outside playing, excercising, and riding bikes. In this new approach to they are making stores in walking distance from your home so you dont even need to use any type of transportation. Paris also limits driving cars due to bad pollution. People were fined for driving on the roads with a 22-euro fine. These cold nights and warmer days were causing a warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. Diesel fuel was to blame since France has a tax policy that favors disel over gasoline. Delivery compaines complained about the stopage of veichles and lost revenue, but due to no one driving around the smog cleared the air. in Bogota, Colombia they expirenced car-free day where everyone walked, hiked, road bikes, or took buses to work. Thsi was the third straight year where cars have been banned and buses and taxis permitted for the day without cars. The goal of this is to reduce smog in the air. ""The rain hasnt stopped people from participating"" says the Mayor of Bogota A bussiness man said its a great oppurtunity and lower air pollution.

23907,0,"If someone wishes to travel somewhere, such as a normal commute, proably the first transportation method they think of is a car. Cars are everywhere. They're the things hiding in a home, waiting for someone to enter the depths of the dark garage. Unless the grage is truly empty of the world-killing machiene, such as in Vauban, Germany where people have done the unthinkable: got rid off cars. Though it may sound proposterous, or even critically insane to even concider giving up a car, the citizens of Vauban are a lot happier to be rid of the burden. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happpier this way"" (Rosenthal, In German Suburb, Life goes On Without Cars). As you may have forgotten, car payments, maintnance, check up, oil changes, and gas are all part of owning a car which may be a financial strain for most. Again, those robots that you move with pedals and a steering wheel are seriously affecting our Earth. We're Earth murderers. ""Passenger cars arw responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"" (Rosenthal, In German Suburb, Life goes On Without Cars). Fellow humans, we are not the only species on planet Earth. We are so used to cars it's like watching something interesting on TV and trying to pull away from it; it's nearly impossible. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clean the air of the global city"" (Duffer, Paris bans driving due to smog). Less driving cars is less greenhouse gasses that destroy our Earth. In our society today, cars are the dominant transportation method. When you go outside in today's world it is most likely not the sound of nature, but a manmade vehicle. Without cars, a whole new world will come forth, or most likely the beautiful world we forgot about that is mercilessly trapped beneath unessesary layers of greenhouse gases. When Paris banned cars, it improved the pollution stuck in the air. ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French part to recind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday"" (Duffer, Paris bans driving due to smog).

9167,0,"As technology continues to progress, it seems evident that it will be important in more and more fields of study. The education sector, for example, has survived for a long time without the use of technology, going all the way back to when Roman scholars wrote on clay tablets. However, like the technology itself, the education system continues to improve, giving students a better learning experience. Knowing this, it is clear to see how technology can be useful in schools. Using more advanced technology allows for students to learn more effectively, and helps teachers to teach in a more impactful way. Thus, the use of facial recognition technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is very valuable, because it helps to better understand students, allowing for teachers to be more effective. A main way that this new technology will be valuable to students in a classroom is the ability it has to comprehend facial expressions. Knowing how a student is feeling can go a long way in terms of determining how to deal with a situation. For example, knowing that one student is mad at someone else but is trying to hide it can help teachers to address this issue, especially in younger grades. In fact, according to Dr. Eckman in paragraph 3, the Facial Action Coding System can recognize ""happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness."" Additionally, this technology goes farther than identifying emotions in a strictly singular setting, but it instead can ""even identify mixed emotions,"" as seen in paragraph 4. This proves to be useful yet again in determining how someone is feeling, even if they are trying to conceal it. The value of facial recognition technology in classroom settings is clear through its ability to read emotions. By knowing what this technology is capable of doing, students can receive a stress-free learning environment. Often times in class, students feel embarassed when they do not understand something, even going as far as not asking a question so that they are not perceived as unintelligent. This leads them to not understanding certain material and becoming stressed as a result. However, facial recognition technology offers a solution to this problem. The use of this technology would be able to ""recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" according to Dr. Huang in paragraph 6. Once again, this could be especially useful in younger grades when students may be too shy to ask a question. Using this technology lets teachers know when a student does not understand a topic, and allows them to modify their teaching style accordingly. The most important result from this technology is the ability it has to make teachers more effective. According to Dr. Huang in paragraph 6, ""most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" Teachers can use this technology to understand what students are trying to communicate, even if they are not verbally talking about it. This leads back into a point from the previous paragraph where this technology was said to be useful for understanding confused students. While these students may not be verbal about their confusion, facial recognition software allows for understanding their emotions regardless. By examining the many ways in which facial recognition technology is beneficial in a classroom setting, it is obvious to understand why such an improvement is valuable. Not only can this technology read a variety of human emotions, ranging from singular emotions to more complex ones, but it can directly sense when a student is feeling a certain way towards a subject. Teachers can use this knowledge to modify their material in a way to effectively teach the students. Doing this reduces possible embarassment from students, allowing for every single student to receive the education that they deserve. Looking at the enormous benefits that result in using facial recognition technology makes it clear as to why this improvement is incredibly valuable when used on students in a classroom."
7284,0,"Is it possible for us to identify human emotions with just a simple picture? Prof. Thomas Haung, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, is working with Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam to make a software that is able to recognize the human emotions on Leonardo da VInci's Renaissance painting, Mona Lisa. You may wonder how a computer can recognize facial movements that we use to express our feelings. Well this computer makes a 3-D model of the face. By this point Dr. Huang gives the work over to a psychologist such as Dr. Paul Eckman, who is the creater of FACS. Eckman has classified six basic emotions such as; happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. All of those feelings are associated with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. Sometimes we can notice these expressions on our own friends almost every day. Then again we might also end up reading their expression wrong, because we aren't really experts. Yet Dr Huang observes that artists such as da VInci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as eletronic code. Wouldn't it be awesome if a computer could read your emotions? Like what if you smiled every time you saw something that you liked, and the computer decided to give you more things simliar to that. Or if you decide you don't like it by scowling or frowning it changes it to something completely different. If these advances were possible it could make learning in school possible to understand if you are struggling. By that I mean you could be getting frustrated with a problem, the computer reads your expression, and suddenly it is giving you an easier version of that same topic you are going over. I think that these softwares actually could be valuablle for the students in the classroom. If the computures could read our expression and help us by automatically changing the lesson to a slightly easier version is very helpful. This can show teachers how well a student is progressing in school by the way the computer is understanding the individual itself. So if it is possible for this kind of technology to happen it would be very successful in most learning industries. This kind of technology can be helpful to some of those who struggle. Sometimes teachers can't just focus on helping one individual at a time every single day when they obviously have other students to attend to. If the computer read every kids facial expression then it could help show the teacher is a student is struggling or not."

The techology will help you with all of your emotions also by telling yourself what you need to get better at in the near future.

Huang has came up with a technology called Facial Action Coding System which is where computers can caculate up the real emotions of a student or person. Studies show that this technology system can read all your emotions you're feeling. It can tell if you're sad,happy,angry and lots more of emotions. Huang states in the text that they tell your emotions by the muscles on your face. Huang also goes on saying that he can pin point out emotins on kids in school. In my defence I dont this this would work accuratley. Not only do i think it would work. Many of teacher would not want to get out that device in the middle of class just to see your kids emotions. Many of kids fake smile or act like they are happy when really they are not. Studies show that they are identified by the muscles but you could easlily get told to smile which changed your muscles which changed the game. Many of student come to school depressed or upset. Many of teacher do not know if they are really happy or not. This technology I feel would not be valuable because maybe the student do not want people to know there emotions. Emotions should be kept private and with this technology it would be open to everyone in a classroom. Overall I feel like this would not benifit anything. I also feel like this would not be valuable to students in classrooms. Therefore This technology may help on paints. One example is the Mona Lisa but not on humans because this could lead to not there real emotions."
5181,0,"I think the Facial Action Coding System would be a great idea for classrooms. The FACS would help teachers know how the student is feeling.

In the article it say that if the software can tell a student is bored or confused that it could "" Then modify the lesson, like an effctive human instructor."" What if the student wasn't confused or bored? So I believe the FACS could be good and bad in the school system. However, in this article it explains how making a happy face in this experiment can make you feel slighty happy? If that is the case it could be a new thing. Kids these days never seem happy about the idea of school. This software could be the end of that. It could change a kids mind on the idea of school. Instead of coming to school just to see friends and try to learn they could also be getting help on the stuff they might be confused about but they are to scared to raise their hand. If the software really works it could detect their face and realize they are confused and change the lesson. I think the Facial Action Coding System could just be the next thing for classrooms. It could help out the students that are to scared to speak up. Also it can also help by telling your teacher or classmates if you are just having a bad day. Therefore, it can help the students understand each other more and just maybe enjoy school the way they should."

Driveless cars can be forseen as a positive insight into the future, however, in the world today, driveless cars are not a plausible option for society. Vehicles as such are not realistic because they are not easily accessible to the majority of individuals, and these vehicles evoke a major concern for public safety; the technology is not full proof. In the passage, it addresses the fact that the devices used in the development of drivless cars could not ""just be purchased at Radio Shack""; the point being made with that comment referes to limited accessibillity. A majority of the world's population consists of the common middle class citizen. The passage also states that the driveless vehicle would ""change the world"". In order for a consumer product (the drivless car) to have a major impact on the world, it needs to be easily avaliable to the common citizen, accorrding to the text, the technology would cost millions of dollars to develop. The cost of technology development would surely be reflected in the price of a driveless vehicle. In order for driveless cars to be successful, the technology must be nearly flawless. Technology is a major saftey concern addressed with the development of driveless motor vehicles. Many people own smart phones in this era, and many owners of smart phones endure technical ""bugs"" or glitches with the technology. Smart phone glitches are not seen as a major issue, but what if the new driveless cars experience such technical difficulties as a smart phone does? Many lives would be placed in peril. Developers of the driveless motor vehicles may create counter arguments to the points made. Manufacturers might claim that the driveless car technology has improved so much so that a driveless car could compete with the standard automatic transmission vehicles on the market financially. This argument is not realistic. If the technology of a standard car is compared to a driveless car by cost, the driveless car is going to automatically require more payments. Another argument that could be presented is the fact that alert drivers could always take control of the driveless car if there is a saftey concern. That statement might be true, however, a consumer is not going to invest in such a feat (the driveless car) if that consumer will have to manually drive the vehicle regardless. According to modern economics, an average consumer will abide by the reasonabally priced standard vehicle over the financially draining uncertain vehicle. The development of the driveless motor vehicle is inticing to imagine. Realistically speaking however, the operation of these vehicles world wide is not a probable option. These vehicles would be financially draining and difficult to manage, and they raise major saftey concerns for the public. The driveless car is a feat for the untouched future."

16934,0,"There has been a huge argument about driverless cars on whether to make them and actually continue with it or not. According to the article ""Driverless cars are coming"", ideas involving driverless cars have been thought of since the 1950s, but the cars have not been fully completed. For that reason, driverless cars should not continue to be developed. Having a car that does the same things you could kind of defeats the purpose of you being in the car at all, there is no point. The cars can be extremely dangerous. If you want to be safe, that means giving up things you might think you want. Driverless cars should not continue being developed because there really is no point in have a car that can do all of the things you are able to do. It is said that driverless cars can operate fully on their own until certain times require otherwise, ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires"" (paragraph 7). These cars can basically be categorized as kind of useless. Why have a car that will basically only drive straight until needing to turn? If there is ever a real driverless car created, it should meet all of the basic requirement such as knowing how to turn properly. Another reason why driverless cars should no longer be created is because they could go horribly wrong while someone is driving. While driving, the driver will want to be able to rely on a car that will take them where they need to go. Driverless cars could be deemed unable to do this. While someone is driving, they do not want their car to break down nor do they want it to explode or anything like the other new devices coming out. There are others also agree, ""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. As a result, in most states ist is illegal even to test computer-driven cars"" (paragraph 9). Some states believe that by putting customers in the seats of these cars, they are putting them in serious danger. This is why some states have these driverlsess cars banned and illegal. If possible and badly wanted, everyone should follow along. Driverless cars might seem very nice until serious things end up happening. They might allow the driver to take a break from driving, let the driver relax and see things without just driving for a long period of time, but they will not guarantee ones safety. If safety is wanted by everyone then driverless cars should be given up on. Also, maybe people actually like driving, they would not want to give up the amazing opprotunity of driving to a computer when they can do it themselves. Driverless cars should wait to be given to the public until fully complete."

This example actually shows how dangerous it could be to let your face be analyzed like that, to be manipulated by companies. The process of buying this product could be taxing on privacy of students face and emotions which would be a legal struggle. The privacy of what people decide to be analyzed by a computer should be a variable because in an age of evolving technology, it is important to still preserve our human values while everything becomes more technological. Things like emotional expressions should be privy to the people-people interaction because it will be better analyzed that way. If there is technology that stores this data, it could make people uncomfortable of what emotional information whoever mans the technology holds. A question of ethics and privacy would completely defeat the purpose of what the technology does in the first place. It would be invaluable to implement this technology into classrooms to read students' emotional expressions because of compromsing costs and ethics needed to implement it. Implementing this into a classroom to collect data for a certain curriculum would be inaccurate and invaluable because every student is diverse in their own way of interpreting and absorbing information. Not only is the student diverse, but the teachers using different teaching methods to teach the same curriculum would then have to be analyzed too. This would be extremely inefficient because there would be so many variables to consider that would make it hard to find a solution or improvement. Another part of this technology that is inefficient is the testing itself. When not in a natural learning environment, the emotions might not be the same in a testing environment. The fact they are conscious of being tested might influence their true emotions, leading to inaccurate results. Regardless of the accuracy of the software, it's results would not reap benefits because there so many emotions and variables to factor such has different curriculums, teaching methods, student mindsets, socioeconomic well-being, etc. Then after considering these several factors, scientists would have to work with the state-mandated curriculum to enforce changes for when students get bored and stressed. Dr. Huang states that,""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"". The value of recognizing emotions with a computer, when a teacher should be able to interpret the emotions of her students accordingly, is invaluable. Instead of making software for computers to inefficiently read student's emotional expressions, teachers and school administrators should be trained to better read student's emotional expressions because they will be the ones to create solutions and enact any change. It would be invaluable to implement this technology into classrooms to read students' emotional expressions because of lack of efficiency and benefits to the classroom. Taking into account the numerous interpersonal variables and inefficiency of the product, it would be inaccurate and invaluable to use this technology to read student's emotional expressions in a classroom. While the research is substantial to analyze, it fall short of a created solution to enact."
8952,0,"In the artical ""Making Mona Lisa Smile."" the author describes how this new techology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify humans emotion. This technology is valuable in a classroom to read emotional expressions because, It wolud make the lesson we do on the computer more intresting, it could help us know how people are felling in that exact time and, it could give us more of an explanation on older pictures so we can understand the picture a little bit better. First of all, the Facial Action coding system would be valuable in a classroom today because, it would make the lesson we do on the computer more intresting. What this means is that insead of a teacher just giving out a lesson that half the class wont even like, the Facial Action Coding system would elinonate that because it get our emotions and give each indiviual person a lesson that fits them the best.""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Seconltly, the Facial Action Coding System would be valuable in a classrom today because, it could help peolpe know how people are felling in the exact time or the picture kind of like we were there in the moment. Ok, if someone took a picture and put it on facebook or something you wouldnt know how there felling you would just know what they wanted you to feel. Just because someone is smiling that doesnt mean they are happy, it just means they are smiling, but with the Facial Action Coding System we would know how the person is actualy felling Thirldy, the Facial Action Coding System wpuld be valuable in a classrom today because, it could give us more of an explanation on older pictures so we can understand the picture a little bit better. So just like the ""Mona Lisa"" the Facial Action Coding System helped us understand how she was felling a the time of the picture. To sum this all up, The Facial Action Coding System is valuable in a classroom to read emotional expressions because, It wolud make the lesson we do on the computer more intresting, it could help us know how people are felling in that exact time and, it could give us more of an explanation on older pictures so we can understand the picture a little bit better."

There is no true face on mars' surface,it is merely a lava dome that takes on the form of an isolated mesa that is about the same elevation as the surface of this red planet. Nothing more than a huge rock formation that resembles a human face, in the sense that there are irregular shadows that create the odd look of eyes, a mouth, and a nose.This illusion may have made its way to movies, magazines.etc... But just because they mention the name of a planet that does not make what they say scientificly backed up. We have already photographed the surface of this grand land structure, and yet it has proved to be nothing more than I have just stated. through research and diligent study we, scientists, have proved scientificaly that this land formation on this astronomical body is, indeed not a face or an alien monument. And to wrap up the matter, Nasa has already sent a team of photographers to collect more photos. The pictures support the fact that, this lava dome is just that, a lava dome."

Driverless cars completly, can be a safey hazard for the passsengers and the pedestrains. There are possibly more negative aspects on this subject than there are postive here is why. Driverless cars have been thought of for a while, Google has had prototypes of these cars that can drive independetly under special conditions since 2009. But their cars can't truly ever be driverless but they do have smart systems that alert the driver for hazardous situations that can cause a crash. Yes the idea of driverless cars has evolved and could keep evoloving but there cant be truly driverless cars because of present law. Present law states are written with the assumption that there is a human driver at all times in control. Because of these laws it makes it illegal to test drive computer driven cars in certain states. And laws can be changed but new ones will be in place in order to cover liabilty in case of an accident as so written. There are companies that have plans on releasing cars that can drive themselves in the future whether or not its supported by the pubilc. Automakers will still continue their work with driverless cars assuming the problem with safely issues are solved in the future. But one problem the public might still have against these cars is whether or not the car is better in control by itself or with a human driver who does have caution of pedestrians and other drivers on the road and with passengers in the car. Yes the automakers can try and program their computer systems to do exactly what they are suppose to do but computers dont have the physcological brain system that a person does when commiting a traffic error like a crash that can result in a injury or death. Like said in the passage if an accident were to occur who would be at fault the manufacturer or the owner of the car? Driverless cars could be a good idea if it had the brain system of a human with causious driving skills and has taken a driving test of some sort but it doesnt its just a computer that has been designed to follow traffic laws and will probably never truly have the safety of passengers and all drivers and pedestrians on the road in mind because it has no mind its a computer. Laws can be changed to continue the research to create the perfect driverless car but safely regulations must be taken in place in order to let one of these cars on the street."
20971,0,"Dear Senator, Thank you for taking the time to read my letter. I would like to bring something to your attention that has been on my mind recently. I think the electoral college is important in picking our presidents and i think that it needs to stay apart of our voting process. The Electoral college is in our history and the founding fathers didnt put it there to just be removed. The Electoral College needs to stay apart of our voting process beause we always have the certainty of outcomes, Everyones presidents, and it avoids run off elections. With an Electoral College we' ll always have the certainty of outcomes because the winning canidate's share of electoral college invaribly exceeds his share of the popular vote. Also its highly unlikely for a tie in the electoral college unlike in popularity. In the Electoral College everyones president. This is such a big part because the electoral college requires a presidental candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. A candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidental election process, is reduced by the electoral college. In conclusion, the electoral college is a great thing for the united states and states. its very much what our founding fathers intendid it to be and it should never be take away. Its neccessary and needed in voting for presidents."
8849,0,"Having a way to read and understand what a student is feeling can be a very useful tool to have in a classroom. In paragraph 6, it states that the FACS can help determine if a student is confused or bored with a lesson and needs help from the teacher. It can then help the teacher modify the learning material to make it easier or more interesting for the students. It can also help determine if there is something going on with the student and whether they need to talk to someone get help. The FACS can also be very useful in helping teachers determine what students are feeling during their classes while learning. For example, a teacher can use the software to help them determine if the students are enjoying the class, or if they are bored during it. The teacher can have the computer record the facial expressions of the students during a normal day of class and review the data that was collected during the day. If compouter finds that the students are bored during the class, the teacher will know that they have to find new ways to make their class more exciting to the the students. This can help the teacher keep the students focused on the lesson so they can properly learn and understand the material. However, sometimes the FACS might be unable to tell what a student is feeling because the student is able to hide their emotions without showing the facial expressions that the software looks for to determine what the students are feeling. If the computer is unable to tell what the student is feeling, then it will not be able to produce acurrate results for the teacher to use and will basically be useless. There are many possiblilites and ways that the FACS software can be used in classrooms to help the teachers and the students out by determining their emotions while learning or teaching and help them improve where needed."

8454,0,"""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" is an article by Nick D'Alto, which deals with computer software that can calculate your emotions through your muscle movement, or ""'action unit.'"" You might be thinking; why do we need such technology when our owns eyes can see emotions? Sadly, our eyes are no longer a necessity. With all jokes aside, the use of this technology would not be valuable in the classroom to read students' emotions. This form of technology can not be installed anywhere. In paragraph seven, it states ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" This means schools would have to spend thousands (depending on the cost of the technology) to install computers that support this software. Schools barely have enough to keep art and music classes running. They can barely feed the students better food. Why would we want to spend money on something students are not afraid to show? As stated above, students are not afraid to show their emotion. In paragrpagh six, Dr. Huang states ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" Us, students, make it very clear when we are bored or confused! We begin to drift off, talk to our friends, or even go on our phones; everything a teacher choices to notice. We do not need a new technology to know when we are bored, we need better paid teachers that have the courage and patience to teach. Emotion algorithm software would not be valuable in classrooms. Schools already struggle with their budgets, and students care less about being silent towards their opinions. We do not need to be improving computers to help us, we need to be improving humans to help each other."

14029,0,"People should participate in the ""Seagoing Program"" because, there is alot of fun activities to there and very active groups. It would also be good to go because experincing something new is a great way to stay happy. Also the text states that you can travel to different places to take animals where they need to go. It is a good way to meet new people and try new things. It is also good to go because you can learn about your history and what happened. You can also learn more about World War II. You can help animals and get to do the things that you want to do. An important fact you should know is that if you go and acually enjoy yourself and work hard you can most likely earn treats like a shcolorship to a collage and also be a pro at the program. Trying something new is also a great way to stay healthy and help u be smarter. You learn new things if first you try it and second you pay attention and try to learn how it works, happened, and came or left. Just like luke did he tried something he never knew he would and soon learned some new stuff that he never thought he would. Its better to take risks than not try at all. Its also a great opportunity because some people wish they could do different things like most people could. Like in the text Luke said that he was very grateful for the oppotunity. He had also stated that it opened the world to him taking that trip. So it would be good for you to go you just don't know how much it would change your life. In conclusion, I think that you should go and try the new program. Its really good to interact with new stuff. I can make a connection to this by when I went to new program and I loved to do all the activities and experince what I like to do. So theses are reasons and ways to go to the program. You can learn alot if you try it and learn new things."
6941,0,"The technology used in the article shouldn't be used to read students emotional expressions. They shouldn't because if a student is very sad or upset even angry you'll want to know why and probably ask them why they feel that way. Some students might want to talk about it, but most probably wouldn't so it might make them even more upset or angry and sad if you ask whats wrong and they dont want to talk about it. Also if it a personal issue the student is having and they tell you what's wrong and you can't help them they might feel like they're doing something wrong and get sad or depressed becasue you can't help them. Also if this was used to read the emotinal expressions of students in the classroom I feel like it would be a distraction and take time out of the students learing to figure out how every student is feeling based on the facial expressions. Another thing could be what of the technology making this possible is wrong, so you walk up to a student and ask them why they're so happy but they are actually really sad. What if the student just changes their apperance to make them look a different way when they are read for their emotion. The last thing is what are the teachers going to do with the imfomation on how they think their students are feeling based on a facial expression. Maybe in a college where you want to be a consuler or something along those lines it would be a good thing to have to teach you how to read others emotions better, but it would be useless in a middle or high school classroom and just cause distractions. This shows why I dont think the technology would be good in the classroom. Becasue the technology could be wrong. Students could change their apparence to seem a different way. And it's useless to the teachers to have this information."
23183,0,"first of all I'm going to argue about changing election by popular vote for the president of the United States. the Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting the a president that out to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense. Second off, but each party, selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed)...[;however,] it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet it happens rarely. Also there are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree; all are practical reasons, not liberal or coservative reasons. Thirdly, a dispute over the outcomes of an Electoral College vote is possible it happened in 2000 but it's less likely than a dipute over the popular vote. The reason is the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. in [ 2012's] election, for example obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral votes compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney... because almost all staes award electoral votes on a winner-take-all-basis, even a slight plurality in a state creates a landslide of electoral-vote victory in theat state. Finally, the Electoral College avoids the problem of election in which no candidates recives a majority of votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoal votes, respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presendential elections process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner."

So here is why I am asking you to join the program just like I did. I know you probaby won't do it but I am just going to try my best to convince you so the first reason is since the (UNRRA hired seagoing cowboys to take care of the horses,youngcows,and mules that were shipped overseas.) That means you would get to help out other countries and their disasters. Another reason you should join is because you get to travel all kinds of places in the world ( Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the acroplis in Greece was special"". he says)which he is actually me. One more reason why is because (luke/I also found time to have fun on board,especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty hold where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling, and games also helped pass time.) So there are 3 reasons that I wrote out of why you should be a seagoing cowboy and if your a girl I suppose you could be a seagoing cowgirl.

18045,0,"In the article, ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the author talks about how cars that don't require a person at the wheel controlling its every movement. The article give benefits and nagative aspects. The invention of ""driverless"" cars would be a hassle more than a gift to people. The first reason that it is too unreliable. This being said because they have the car being run by a computer. Computers can most of the time in life can be very useful, but yet can crash and become ineffective to the user. Imagine you are ""driving"" down the highway at sixty miles per hour and all of a sudden the system that is controlling it fails. Now you going sixty miles per hour with no driver at the wheel and surrounded by other drivers. In the article they stated about having a warning system to notify the person in the driver's seat. In the time it takes for that driver to reach the wheel the car could crash. Now if a actual living person was on the wheel they could decrease the chance of loseing control and already be on the wheel if it happens. Thats one exaple why ""Driverless Cars"" should not be used. Here is another reason why they shouldn't be used. A second reason is the cost for a person to buy one of these cars. The article talks about how they were going to upgrade the roads instead of the cars, but they soon realized the price they would have to pay too much money to replace all the roads we have now. When that planned failed hey went to enhancing the cars themselves. They made a prototype for what they believe to be a ""smarter car."" They put all these fancy gadgets into it like a automotive radar sensors, Gps receivers, and a spinning sensor on the roof. This spinning sensor will project a 3-D model of the cars surroundings. How much is that gonna cost to make and put into the cars. They talked about replacing a money issue with another money issue. The prices for cars with all these exspensive gadgets will make the prices for cars sky rocket. Not everybody could afford a car that cost that much. That is example why money would be a big issue with these cars. Here is a third reason for why they should not be used. A third and Final reason is that if an accident occurs who's fault is it. Exactly what they talked about in the article. Referring to paragraph two above, if an accident like would occur would the person who was ""driving"" the car be at fault for not controlling it good enough or the computer in the car's fault for crashing. You can't really blame a computer can you. Then it would be the manufacturers fault then right? If we had them there would have to be a debate to determine who's fault it was and if they should be punished. Now if a actual person was at the wheel we would know who to blame and we wouldn't have to go through all that trouble to find out whos fault. That is another reason why they would be a trouble to everybody. The invention of ""Driverless"" cars would be more of a hassle than a gift to people. The cars can be unreliable, can cost too much, and too much trouble for one accident. These are why they shouldn't be used and reason why they are doing more damage then they are helping society."

These cars are not fully safe. Even though driverless cars are not an completely awful idea, i think manufacturers have a lot of kinks and problems to work out before they plan on getting any further with driverless cars.

These cars would probably also be easier to handle and make driving more enjoyable. In these days, there is the technology to help smarter cars prosper. Driverless cars may have some challenges but like the article states, these cars would change the world. Driverless cars are much safer than the convential cars that are used today. There are many reckless drivers out there that cause car accidents and deaths just about every day. According to the second paragraph of the article, the driverless cars created by Google have driven over half a million miles without a crash. Driverless cars would operate smoothly and theoretically, they could eliminate the possiblility for human error. Under specfic conditions, some cars have been able to drive independly since 2009. This could imply that it might not be that long before driverless cars start to take over. Driverless cars would make transportation much easier. Since attention would only be needed in a rare state of emergency, the driver can mostly just sit back and relax. According to the eighth paragraph of the article, some manufactureres plan to develop in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. The displays can aslo be used to alert the driver, if necessary. Today, most drivers have to be constantly vigilent for harmful threats on the road. Driverless cars on the other hand, will allow the driver to do something fun and relaxing while being automatically taken to a destination. Modern techonology has allowed driverless cars to be fully developed with less complications. According to the fourth paragraph of the article, Google modified a normal car by adding many different sensors to it. There are also a video camera, automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and motion sensors. The technology has finally caught up to make driverless cars a possibility. Driverless cars may still need modifications because there are still faults in dealing with traffic and roadwork. Despite these challenges, driverless cars are still the best option for transportation in this nation. Cars have been driven for over a century. Enhancing cars to be driverless would start a revolution in transportation. Driverless cars are one of the safest and easiest option for traveling. In just a few years, with manufacturers making more modifications and states modifying some traffic laws, driverless cars will truly change the world."

The Idea of a facial expression reading computer is a good idea but for as long it is used for the right intentions such as using it to read picture of families to know how they are feeling, or using it for a class that is not interested into a subject so the computer alters the lesson to change up the lesson to make more entertaining for the students, but for advertisements that is not very good way to use technology in that way. If the human race is going to use technology like it should be used responsibily and used to help man kind to strive to become better. The technology for this is remarkable and how we are going this far to use technolgy like this for only medical purposes, for learning, and to see if some one is lying or telling the truth. If it is going to be used to fill companies pockets full of cash for advertisements it shouldn't be allowed cause taking photos or using technology to invade on peoples privacy just to adjust their own benefits, and I can see it being used for purposes like art work just like the Mona Lisa. The Facial Action Coding System(FACS) and really what makes it remarkable it tells you all of the emotions that they are feeling rather than just one specific emotion. It tells you from the emotion they feel the most to the one they feel the least about. It is outstanding how technology could come so far in a short amount of time and their is a saying that comes with it comes great power, comes great responsibility and their is technology that is either taken for granted or it is misused for the all of the wrong reasons.

17556,0,"I will be sharing three reasons with you why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. For one, if you are an animal lover you get a chance to help the animals on the cattle boat. As it says in the text, ""On his second trip, Luke seved as a night watchman. His job was to check on all the animals every hour."" The second reason is that even though you are serving around the world you still get to go sight seeing. In paragraph five it says, "" Luke also toured an exavated castle in Crete and maveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China."" The third reason is that you get to be of sevice around the world to help countries after World War II. In the story it says, ""To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, forty-four nations joined together to form UNRRA (The United Stations Relief and Rehabilitation Administation)."" So in conclusion why you should join the Seagoing Cowbows program is because you can have fun and be of sevice at the same time."
3451,0,"Venus is one of the brighest points of light in the night sky and sometimes called ""Evening Star"". Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, It has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. In ""The Challange of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursit despite the danger it presents. Three reasons that supports author idea is Venus has dangerous geology and weather, the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere, and the surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The fisrt reason is Venus present dangerous geology and weather. In Venus, the climate and weather are worst and danger which make nothing to survive. in a paragraph, it said "" Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting vocanoes, powerful earthquake, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on it's surface."" This show why it's danger for anything that land on Venus. The second reason is venus has the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. In a paragraph, it said "" The cloud conditions are far more extreme than anything human encounter on Earth; scuh as enviroment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" this show how it is dangerous to humans and enviroments. The third reason is the surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fehrenheit. Also the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than our planet. In a paragraph, it said "" Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system and solar power power would be plentiful, and radition would not excced Earth level."" This support that no one can live on Venus because of the temperature. So, In "" The Challenge of Exploring Venus, "" The author suggests that studying venus is worthy pursit despite the danger it presents because of this three reasons. Venus has dangerous geology and weather, the clouds of highly corosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere, and the surface temperatures average over 800 degree fehrenheit. Venus is referred to as Earth's ""twin,"" It's dangerous for living organisms to live."
13868,0,"Hello I am Luke Bomberger and i'm going tell why you to join the Seagoing Cowboys. The reason anybody wouldn't want to pass up the oppertunity like the Seagoing Cowboys is because it's a opportunity of a lifetime. The reason I say this because it opens up the world to you, it lets you see amazing things in other countrys. This program also allows you to help other people in the world because of war. It really doesn't hurt to help other people in the times of war. The Seagoing Cowboys also doesn't have you traveling alone on your missons, you have other people to travel with! There's things you can do with your crew mates that I did with my mates such as baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, and more. A few examples of the benefits of being a Seagoing Cowboy is sight-seeing. You can see famous structures from all over the world including the origanal Rome, the Statue of Liberty,and the great wall of China. Another reason to join is to make friends. I was already friends with of them, Don Reist but i've made more friends thanks to joining."
17245,0,"Driverless Cars are Coming Imagine a world where drivers are not needed to drive a car! Now that's a world I want to live in. There's always advantages and disadvantages of new technology but I believe this innovation could change the world. Driverless cars don't require drivers, as said in the word, that are ran by computers and sensors to make it much safe for you and other drivers. It has many benefits like less fuel than cars, more flexibility than a bus, it eliminates blind spots, and are already on our way. One of the positive aspect of driverless cars are that it uses far less fuel than a taxi. Fuel for cars, gasoline, are dug up from earth and ruins the planet. The less fuel we can use, the less damage we cause, the longer we can live on this planet. Factories and cars are already ruining the atmosphere with carbon emissions anyways so we have to do our best to prevent problems that could be stopped. Another benefit of driverless cars are that it's has more flexible schedule than a bus. We all waited and wasted important minutes and hours of our life, waiting for that bus to arrive. What if you don't have to wait for it anymore? What if there was a better alternate for that's in between taxis and bus. Driverless are different from current cars becuase it has sensors on the wheel, video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors,a GPS receiver, intertial motion sensor, and most importantly the the rotating sensor on the roof.The rotating sensor on the roof collects 3-D model of the car's surroundings, mimicing what drivers will see plus more! Us humans have blind spots while driverless cars have none. Blind spots in drivers have caused a lot of death espicially in young children because you can not see what's behind and under you or what's on the side of you. In this one accident a toddler got ran over by her own parent because she was in the cars blind spot. Having a 3D model of the car's surrounding collected by the dubbed LIDAR laser beam can prevent these kind of tragic death. The idea of driverless cars aren't something new. It's in various movies and shows filling our young brain with hope that one day you don't have to drive cars, and that cars can drive themselves. The sensors that are needed for driverless cars have been here since the 1980s first used for antilock brakes. Living in generation Z, the generation of technology, we're rapidly inventing new technology. We're rapidly getting smarter by trial and error, we're rapidly getting smarter by the information exposed through the internet, we're rapidly getting smarter. Our smart phones used daily by everybody in a civilized countries were a product of generation Z. At first there were a lot of people disagreeing with smart phones but look where we are now. That is probably what will happen with dreiverless cars. With both advantage and disadvantages balanced, investing in driverless cars and using driverless cars in the future is a great idea. Some advantages like saving fuel, more convineant than a bus, having no blind spot, and with all the positive technologies around, it will be a great invention."
985,0,"INTRODUCTION: venus is a big planet, sometimes is called ""evening star"", is one of the brightest point of light in the night sky making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot. In our solar system, venus is the second planet from our sun. BODY: Venus is a secons planet with more similarity in our solar system, in terms of density an size and occasionally in distance. venus is a big planet for to go investigate. The atmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankets venus. on the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greather than waht we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus, for example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of venus's surfaces and have lasted for three weeks i such conditions. Another project is use old technology called mechanical computers. Just imagine exposing a cellphone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin. ESSAY: If you think is good if the NASA want search information about Venus, and end venus is a planet with more silmilarity to the Earth, i think is good but with the genocide atmosphere is so hard if we try live on Venus. maybe just how are the atmosphere or search life in other planets but for live on venus is a big problem. just live one day or less, or the human body change or some people born different the others. these conditions are not for a human, the human be killed in seconds. is a big challenge live is this planet, the temperatures are not for humans the clouds are acid and we don't know if this planet has other lifes."
11997,0,"Driverless cars? These style cars may be th future of our transportation, whether efficient or not. They may use less gas and they may be less dangerous than regular human controlled vehicles. I feel that these style vehicles are more dangerous than the regular vehicle because of the computer programming. Something may go wrong in the system and these cars may not be smart enough to transport human beings. I am against the use of these vehicles and say we stick with human controlled vehicles. Will these cars actually work? These cars can be extremely dangerous to us humans and may be the cause of accidents or even death. The computer programming system would have to control all of the driverless cars and something may go wrong. These cars may lose access to the computer programming system and then go out on a mind of its own. If detached from the system then they could speed up or slow down whenever it wants to and the human may have no way of stopping it. Due to this we may see a major increase in accidents and maybe even fatal accidents. What about when people need to take over due to a construction zone or an accident. Will the car actually switch over every time or will it stay doing what it wants? That is a question we all need to ask ourselves, will the car actually work? If a new construction zone comes about how is the car going to automatically know to let you take over or to slow down. Or what about an accident what if your ""smart"" car is going the speed limit but needs to slow down for an accident that is quickly approaching. Bam!! there you are doing 55 mph on the highway and an accident occurs how is your car going to know when to stop. Another question we need to address is, does it actually use less gas? The car may or may not use less gas, but I feel it uses the same amount. When driving you are going the speed limit and sometimes a little over, but the smart car may stay at the speed limit, if you both go the same distance then you most likely use the same amount of gas. And the speed limit, how does the car know how fast to go? Does it have a built in camera or sensor that can detect the road signs and switch speed that easily. Or does it just have a mind of its own and go how fast it feels like it should. These are things manufacturers need to address and try to figure it out. What about expenses, how expensive will this task be? According to the article we would need to put sensors in the roads and many sensors in the cars. Expenses may be a big issue because what if that doesn't work then we would have wasted the money on putting in sensors that we can't get back. These cars may be a big advamnce or not an advancement at all, they might even be a total failure. These cars are probably wanted by many people because they seem easy and people may think they can relax while the car does its work. I feel that those people are incorrect because they still have to be prepared to take over and have to worry about accidents that are likely to occur. I say we don't make these cars and stick with the human controlled vehicles."

We are in an age where computers can do anything, or almost anything. Computers have taken over so many jobs like makeing cars, phones, televitions, and so many other things. When this generation grows up and becomes adults we need to know how to use computers and the way its going everyone will need to know how to use computers. When I wake up in the morning I emediatly look at my phone or smart watch to see all my missed messages or lack there of, and every night when I go to bed I look at my phone for atleast an hour before I actualy go to bed. through out the day I am constantly using my laptop the school provides every student in the school. When every one is working on there laptops all there faces are blank and you don't know how they feel. I don't think that more computer entelagence is what we need in schools these days. What we need is more enteraction with others. Any where you are wether it be in a buisness confrence or half way acrost the world in china you are going to have to have come human interaction. Its not all about computers. In school I don't think we need to have a computer that is able to read faces to see if someone is happy or not. we have eyes and can see it for our selves. We just have to raise our eyes up from our screens and look around and interact with other people. A computer can't make you happy like human interaction can. In other words, no, I don't think we need a technology that can reed the emotions of people by looking at there face. That is just one more job a machine can do that a human doesn't have to do any more."
16407,0,"I am against driverless cars because if something goes wrong you cannot control it only the car can. I will say reading from the article the driverless cars can be beneficial. Althought testing driverless vehicles is illegal in most states. Also driverless cars will need a lot more work done on them before they will every be legal to drive. The pros about driverless cars are they have automatic antilock brakes. Also driverless cars can handle driving functions up to 25 mph. Another pro about driverless cars is they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves. The negatives about a driverless car is drivers would get bored waiting for their turn waiting to drive. Also you have to drive if traffic gets to heavy, or navigating through work zones. Also there would have to be more traffic laws if this happened. Also there are many problems with driverless cars that manufactures are working on. Lastly I am against driverless cars because they are almost just like a regular car. The car drives for you, but you have to drive when traffic gets heavy. Also there is traffic almost everyday when you are traveling. Also driverless cars have have just as many positives as negative so there is really no pinty of driverless cars."
5377,0,"The Facial Action Coding System is a very useful tool used to help tell what other peoples emotions are just by their facial expresions. Having this technology can be very helpful in the classrom. It can help define the mixed emotions of a student, how they feel of a topic they are learning, and if a student is telling the truth. The first reason as to why this technology is useful in the classroom is defineing the mixed emotions of students. In the artical it says ""The software can even identify mixed emotions"" (paragraph 4). Being able to identify mixed emotions of a student can be helpful. Sometimes a student may be stressed and upset over something, making it hard for them to concentrate on their work. You can't just let them not work though, but knowing their feelings you may be able to take it more slow paced for them that day. The student may have felt angry and stressed before they came into class, explaining why they got so upset when they couldn't find their homework. Another reason this would be useful in class is by defining how they feel about a topic in class. In this article it says ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... Then it could modify the lesson"" (paragraph 6). Having this tool say when they are confused is extraemly helpful. It lets the teacher know they may need some extra help, and the computer know to explain things in a different way. When a student becoms bored of what they are doing it becomes hard for them to concentrate, or causes them to want to rush through. The final reason Facial Action Coding Systems should be in classrooms is because it can help tell when a student is lying. In paragraph 8 of the article it says ""Muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a 'smiling' politcian or celebrity isn't being truthful."" This can help a teacher know when an anxious student needs help, but says they don't. Some students may be too anxious to actually speak up when they need help, causing them to lie when a teacher ask them if they do. This also comes in handy when a student has done something and no one knows who it was, like tearing down a poster or putting a tac on the teachers seat. In conclusion, this technology would be very useful for classrooms to define a students emotions to improve work, help a confused or bored student, and spot out lairs."
11904,0,"There are both positive and negative aspects of driveless cars. There are reasons on why driveless cars should be on the road. But, there are also reasons on why they should not be on the road. One reason why they should be on the road is because they would use half the fuel of today's taxi. One reason on why they shouldn't be on the road is because they still need a human in the smart car, and that might cause wrecks due to the driver if he/she is not paying attention. One reason why the smart cars should be on the road is that they are better on fuel. Google cofounder Sergey Brin says that he envisions a future with a public transportation system where fleets of driveless cars form a public-transport taxi system. He also says that the cars he forsees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer more flexibility than a bus. Television and movies have long been fascinated with cars that could drive themselves. Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009. One reason on why they should not allow driveless cars on the road is the possibility to wreck. The driver still has to remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires. This necessitates the car being ready to quickly get the driver's attention whenever a problem occurs. Which sometimes it might not quick enough or the driver might not have enough time to react, which will possibly cause a wreck. Another reason why they shouldn't allow smart cars is because they will cause more wrecks. Since they can steer, accelertate, and brake themselves, they might not brake in time when they get close to another vehicle. But, they notify the driver when the road requires human skills. They notify the driver when the driver needs to navigate through work zones and around accidents. And, they are better on fuel. They shouldn't let the driverless cars on the road due to the possibilies of a wreck. Also, they might not give the driver enough time to react. Then, the smart cars require a driver in the vehicle anyways, and they need full attention inside the vehicle. Another reason on why they should ban the vehicles is because the quick change from vehicle to driver would be very quick."

23511,0,"The advantages of limiting car usage result in a healthier environment for you and your children, exercise by walking or riding a bike, and saving money on parking and gas. Limiting car usage would be beneficial for the environment because the gas wouldn't polute the air. Green house gas emissions from tailpipes polute the air that everyone is breathing. If the car usage was limited, then the air would start to become fresh again. Stated in the passage, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" This exerpt from the passage ""Car-Free Cities"" explains that Europe's percentage is too high and they need to drop it fast or the percentage will grow and the greenhouse gas emissions will increase. Limiting car usage isn't a big move like most people are making it out to be. Walking to pick up your child from school isn't such a bad thing! It gives you bonding time to spend with them outdoors. You can walk or ride a bike to the park to play. Especially if it is less than 1 mile! Walking is a great way to exercise and its free! FREE! This component of ""smart planning"" could work if eveyone helped by reducing car use. Having a car is expensive! You have to pay for gas, which is expensive, and you have to pay to park your car! If you live in the area where you want to go, walk! But if you're going to the grocery store, obviously you would take your car if you're getting a lot at the store. You have to pay to park in the parking garage and that is $40,000 with a house. The passage ""Car-Free Cities,"" states that ""70% of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57% sold a car to move here."" In that town, everything is pretty close to each other so you don't have to drive anywhere. If you needed to go visit a family member in a different city, the the train! It's fun, free, and calming. As you can see, you don't need to drive a car. Yes, you can drive a car, but why would you? You have buses, and trains, and other ways of transportation. This way, you don't have to pay for gas to go to the park. Not using your car is healthy for the environment and it's great exercise. It's a good way to get outdoors and have a nice walk. So please, just try using your car a little bit less everyday and soon enough, you will rarely use it, the air will be fresh, and you'll be taking some nice strolls in the park with your family."

Driverless cars are not stable for all on the road task. Driverless cars have many abilities being completely safe is not one of these abilties. In 2013, when the ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" was announced by the BMW the car was not completely driverless. That is because the car still needs human skills to complete some task. The law assumptions are that a car is only safe with a human behind the wheel at all times. Driverless cars can not be trusted. Accidents happen even with humans abbord and alert so don't trust a manufactured driverless car to keep you safe. A wreck could happen and who would be to blame? Who would be fixing the damages?

21911,0,"Limiting Car Usage The number of positive connotations that limiting car usage around the world would have on society is infinite. It would lower congestion, promote more healthy and efficient means of travel, and it would reduce emissions by a very large factor. People around the world are turning towards methods of transportation that do not monopolize on the automobile. Maybe one day cars will be passé? According to a study in Paris, congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France after prohibiting driving for a few days, and fining those who disregarded the experiment. Less congestion led to less road noise, which, in turn, made people ""happier."" It created a safer environment for children and parents alike. Having fewer cars on the road encouraged people to go outside whenever they could. Citizens of Vauban, a city in Germany, are taking this newfound peacefulness to an extreme. Driving is forbidden in their city and there are not any available parking spaces in the event that they still own a car! Vauban is an example of a city that was built based on ""smart planning."" More communities are adopting this ideal and try to have everything located within walking distance of a person's home. This encourages people to get to where they need to go without the use of an automobile. People nowadays also have the technology to communicate with others electronically, so that reduces the need for an automobile to get from point A to point B. Why waste the time and money on gas to communicate with someone when you could send them an email or text for a low cost in a matter of seconds? This being said, limiting car usage promotes public transportation services. In Bogota, 118 miles worth of bicycle paths have been built in an effort to steer people away from automobiles. This encourages people to get from place to place via a healthy and fun means of transport. Undoubtedly, people are more likely to stay close to home without the accessibility of cars, so limiting the use of cars saves the time that would be spent on the roads. Limiting car usage has major benefits when it comes to carbon emissions and environmental problems. President Obama has wanted to curb the United States' emissions and so far his goal is a success. Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. Smog has been severely reduced in countries around the globe since plans to limit car usage have gone into effect. Limiting car usage might seem like something that ""would be good in theory,"" and it will definitely be a hard thing for today's generation to wrap their head around, but the positive impacts it would have on society are limitless. Congestion and emissions would be reduced, time spent commuting would be saved, and the world would be a much safer place to live in overall. Limiting car usage everywhere is definitely something to think about."

The drivers family would want to sew the car manufactures. He says ""The Manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the raod. While the driver watches the roas, the car watches the driver. Driverless car shouldn't be aloud to become a thing even tho is has some good things, it also has alot of bad things too.

After that thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting for the image to appere, when finally when the first image appeared on a JPL web site, revealing a natrual landing form. There was no Alian monument after all. If the ""face"" was created by an Alian/Anlians there would be trakings of them and all that and it was really hard to see because it was winter at the time. They dont pass the unknown figure very offten, but when they did they payed really close attintion to the figure. They took more pictures to discover them. They still found know tracings or sighs that alians made this. What the picture really showes is the Martiam equivalent of a butte or mesa- landingforms common around American West. ""Its a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same hight and the Face on Mars."""

Venusian geology and wheather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, poweful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to proes seeking to land on its surface.They explain why Venus is the best planet to study because is the most closest planet to Earth and the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also becase human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. First of all, Venus is the best planet to study because is the most closest of our planet. Venus is the may well once have been the most Earth like planet in our solar system. Venus sometimes can be our nearest option for a plenetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a missing both safe? Venus is our sister planet so inhospitable. Venus is sometimes right around the corner in space terms, humans have numerous spacecrat to land on this cloud draped world. Secondly, If Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too, so Venus, Earth and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. However, these differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus. This explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on venus in more than three decades, because numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us. ""Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" However, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. Lastly, the author explains trie to tell how Venus is a good planet to study because long ago "" Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various froms of life just like Earth."" The planet has a surface of rocky sedimet and includes familiar features such as velleys, mountains, and craters.The NASA has one particularly compeling idea for sending humans to study Venus, possible solutions to the hostile condition on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitudes to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground condiction by staying up and out of their way. In conclusion, the best planet for the humans to study is Venus because it's our sister planet, and the scientist even discussing futher visits to its surface, the astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth like planet in our solar system.

Many emotions can be seen on the face but, students have learned to keep those emotions well hidden with the intention of not wanting anyone to know or find out. Technology being able to determine students' emotion would be extremely benefitial in helping the student fell better and being able to share their emotions. Using devices to read our emotions would help frowning students smile more when they need it. The computer would be able to read their face by seeing the facial movements and determine whether a student is becoming bored in class. According to Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, having a computer that can read emotions in class "" could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor""(D'Alto 6). This could improve the student's learning skills and can help the teacher be notified when and where a student needs help. This technology would not only be benefitial in the student's school life, but also in his or her personal life too. Computors would be able to see if a student was truely unhappy or upset and would be able to help in a way a human could not. The student may not want anyone to know of their sadness, but a computor knowing is harmless. Depending on the mood, "" if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different"" (D'Alto 6). With this technology, when someones is upset, something happy and encouraging could pop up and make them smile. This could brighten a student's mood and encourage them to keep working with a better attitude going out than going in. The ability to know how someone is feeling without them having to say it could make it easier for people to jump in and help each other out. If one student sees another who was putting on a fake smile, they may be able to encourage them or say something nice to put a real smile on their face. Theory of Emotion, ""moving your facial muscles not only expresses the emotions, but may even produce them"" (D'Alto 9). Putting a smile on someone's face, even for a second, can truely make a difference. This technology would be extremly valuable a student's academic life, to help them to do their best and succeed, and in their personal life, to be more of a light to others."

In a class room students can get board and start to dose off, not totally engagin in what needs to be done. With a FACS it could help a teacher know what the class needs and so see whos understanding what fully. At times in a class room it can be hard for students to foucuse for a number of reasons such as: The topic is ' boring', not totally understanding, the teacher isnt explainin it clear enough. For what ever reason a student has for not being able to foucse the FACS could help let the teacher know that that students may need individual help, or that she/he needs to make the lesson more intesting due to the lact of enthusism or focuse dring that period. In paragraph 5 it states that "" infact we humans persorm the same impressive calculation everyday."" Although this may be true, at times we may not be as accurate as we'd like and we miss things. The FACS could also be a help in some students lives who are going through somthing and need someone to talk to, such as depression or stress. The FACS could indicate that they are destracted, worried, or scared about somthing witch could result in the teacher sitting them down and being the person they needed to talk to. All in all i belive the FACS would be a good handy tool in classrooms as a way to read students expressions. Not only would this help teachers to make certain topics more intresting but it could help in the personal lives of children."
12797,0,"Driverless cars are coming to us soon, which means less driving. In the article, they say driverless cars will do the driving 90 percnt of the time. The only time the people will really have to drive is if there is tricky traffic or roads, and pulling in and out of driveways. For the most part, these driverless cars cover all of your driving other then that. This would be great for people that have to drive a lot for work and that are very busy. It would take a lot of stress and pressure off of teens or even adults that get easily frustrated or really serve road rage. If you aren't paying attention to the road when you are driving for whatever reason, then your car would technically be doing it for you. In case you miss something, or happen to almost run a red light, driverless cars would prevent things like that from happening! The article states that the car will pay attention to you just as much as you pay attention to it, and the roads. Which is great, because this will basically cover anything bad that could happen wihile driving like speeding, or running red lights, which means less tickets and getting pulled over. This also could really help out with less car accidents and save lives tremendously! A little help would never hurt with driving for everyone, or something there to keep an extra eye on you to be safe, because there are a lot of not-so-good drivers out there. Everyone will agree with that! Overall, driverless cars would be brilliant and do wonders for anyone at all who drives. Driveless cars could save you money, and or tickets/court, and lastly, even your life! These cars could change history even!"
16593,0,"Having driverless cars could both be a positive and negative idea. My thought on having driverless cars is that I think it could be a helpful and safe operated vehicle depending on the driver. First, I think one of these cars is a good thing because it is more enviorment friendly and could use half as much gasoline as a normal car does today. The text states ""the cars he foresees would use half the fuel's taxis and offer far more flexability than a bus."" Therefore, the way I view this, is it could be a better vehicle for the world seeing as Google foresees that it could use half as much gas, and also that it is more flexable than buses. Second, I think this is a good vehicle because it will have many more features than a regular car, but even though it will be a driverless car the person driving the car will still have to be aware of the sourroundings or when a problem occurs such as through work zones, or accidents. The text states ""they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are still designed to notify the driver if a problem has occured."" This means to me, that safety still could be a concern, but if the driver is aware of everything happening around them, it could be the smartest car out there. Lastly, although I do think this could be a well made, manufactured vehicle, there are still flaws about it, that could change someone's whole point of view on the car. As stated before, it is a driverless car, but the driver still needs to be aware of sourroundings and whats happening on the road. As safe and smart as Google may make this vehicle, anything could happen at anytime wheather it could be that it did not brake itself at the right time, or something were to happen with the computers that was put in to run the vehicle. The text states ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or manufacturer?"" I agree strongly with this question, but I believe that whatever could happen with it, lies upon what caused the damage. Ultimately, Google's driverless car could be a good or bad vehicle, but in my opinion I do think it could be good, although there are many things I would be worried about such as any misfires that could happen."

If we had driverless cars think about how much safer our world could be. Just think about it. Think about all the car accidents that happen all the time as a result of drivers simply not paying attention. Now, if we had driverless cars the number of accidents would go down by a whole bunch! Driverless cars have sensors everywhere on them, interior and exterior, that could keep people safe. Driverless cars would be a lot better for the earth also. The reason why they would be better for the earth is because they do not have to burn as much gas, which means less pollution in the air. The last way that driverless cars could benefit us is because driverless cars get way better gas mileage. In paragraph one the author says ""The cars Sergey Brin, Google cofounder, foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus."" Driverless cars seem like such a good idea for this world!

14541,0,"Is there really life on Mars? This question was asked by millions in 1976. A face was detected by Viking 1, a spacecraft, when it was gathering pictures and information for another landing spot on Cydonia. But is this really an alien? After NASA has collected other information and pictures, it is certain that the Face is just a natural landform. The Face is a mesa, which is a common land feature on Mars. ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh (p.2)."" The shadows and poor camera quality had made the mesa look like a face. ""Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA...(p.6)"" Though, most scientists didn't believe that it was really an alien artifact they still were going to prove that it wasn't an alien artifact. Photographing Cydonia became a new priotity. When scientists went back to get more pictures they still found the same answer, only more certain. It is not an alien artifact. The pictures they captured only make it more clear that it isn't. ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the firts time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos (p.7)."" After, the new picture was taken, not all were satisfied. So, NASA went back out to Cydonia to capture another shot. This time, each pixel captured 1.56 meters, which is very detailed. There is no way the picture could have been misinterpretted. The Face is just a natural landform. Opposers say that this information is bona fide evidence. ""Some people think that the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. ""These people think that NASA is just trying to hide it from them. This is not true. ""Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars (p. 5)."" If NASA hopes to find life on other planets, why would they hide it? ""But not everyone was satified (p.8)."" NASA has went back to Cydonia three different times, and the thought that it is just a mesa has gotten more certain each time. The ""ten times sharper"" camera proves that is just a natural landform. Some may say that NASA is not trying hard enough to figure it out. ""We don't just pass over the Face very often (p.9)"" ""In fact, it's hard work (p.9)."" As you can tell, targeting Cydonia is not very easy, and NASA still got three shots just to prove them wrong. The Face is just a natural landform. It is not an alien artifact, and if you don't believe me by now you aren't using logic. NASA worked hard to get the three pictures that reveal the Face. It is a mesa, which is common around Cydonia. Any landform can have shadows that look like a face, this one just happened to be on Mars, where we are looking for life."

Humans have always looked to the future where cars would one day be able save us in more accidents. We also want cars to use less fuel and could be able to drive us anywhere. However, we never truly look on at what it takes to build a driverless car, until we do. However, not only do driverless cars take time to make, once driverless cars are complete, there is more responsiblity that comes with the product. Driverless cars a great thing for our future because the cars can save us in moments where humans can fail, each of them will use less fuel, and drive us anywhere. Even today, there are driverless cars andregular cars present the ability so prevent accidents to some extent. In each of today's cars, there are sensors and other gadgets that send information to the car's computer. Processing this information, cars can apply brakes to certain tires and cut the engine in faster time than humans could, if the time ever came up for it. One such car, Google's modified Toyota Prius runs such sensors, video cameras, and gps recievers to run driverless car software. Another reason, driverless cars will help the gas prices lower all around the world. Gas prices constantly rise as more demand for it arises and the supply of it lowers. The driverless cars of the future will need as less as half the amount of fuel or lower. With cars needing less fuel, the prices will lower due to it being affordable to give to everyone. And with more fuel, cars can travel farther and to more places. With this in mind, the driverless cars of the future will drive humans to any place needed. Some may think it impossible, but Google cofounder Sergey Brin belives otherwise. He believes the cars in the future could be used as a public transportation system, with fleets of driverless cars as public-transport taxis. He believes it can be great. However, for a driveless car to be the greatest it can be, it first has to be driverless. The driverless cars that are currently existing today cannot claim the title of driverless. Each car will drive to the destination as required but will alert the human to stay awake and alert such that one can take over the car when nearing accidents or work zones. So that raises the question, how can we make this car truly driverless? The technology and cars of today are not driverless yet but in time they could be. These future cars will drive humans to any destination without human assistance. Each car will run on less fuel, effectively lowering gas prices. And with its software, the car and the human will witness less accidents. Due to special software, the cars will prevent accidents,burn less fuel, and drive to any destination."

Google has developed their own type of driverless car. The text states, ""Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009."" The technology for driverless cars is not as new as some people might think. This idea has been around for more than six years.

18569,0,"A Face To Remember A distinctly human face, nearly two miles in length, stretches across an arid, barren landscape. This came to be known as ""the face on Mars. It is a highly debated topic, being that some believe it was made by intelligent lifeforms, and others believe it to be a naturally formed landform. The latter is, beyond the shadow of a doubt, correct, the reasons range from picture evidence, to the same landforms forming on Earth, to the fact that it would help NASA's budget immensely if life were to be discovered on other planets. To begin with, concrete photos have been released to the public that clearly show that the ""face"" is merely shadows cast onto a natural landform. Since the beginning of its discovery in 1976, ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah."" Guess what? They were right, because in 2001, Mars Global Surveyor brought back a photo of the mesa that was in the ""...absolute maximum resolution,"" and it perfectly showed the mesa for what it was; a naturally formed chunk of land. Another thing distinct about this landform is that we have similair, proven-to-be natural landforms on Earth. To quote Garvin, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" This means it is an undeniable truth that these kind of things can form naturally. Of course because something can, usually means that it will, so, without denial, this landform is proven to be real, and able to form. The final fact of the matter is that NASA would get an enormous amount of funding if they could prove there to be life among the stars. So the truth is, ""...defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" This discovery would lead to a piqued interest in space, and a need to conduct further research, meaning people would begin to give more donations to this new, interesting cause. In the end NASA would benefit, and the point is proven wrong. Over all, consiracy theorist seemingly wish to stir the masses, and make distrust flourish, but most times their theories are easily dissproven. The theory of the face on Mars was simple, and very wrong. The topic of solid photographs seems not to be enough, but the similair landmarks being on Earth, and the way it would positively effect NASA's budget should be. After all, there may still be life on Mars, for this is but a bump on a planet."
20475,0,"Many car manufacturers have been working on making driverless cars. This goal is evidently complex and difficult to achieve. It requires advanced technology to be able to create a satisfactory vehicle of this type. So, it is understandable that we have not reached this goal thoroughly. In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. The development of computer-driven cars are not the best driverless vehicles invented, but they are certainly a good start to the manufacturing of autonomous cars. For example, the author states that ""many furturists believed the key to developing self-driving cars someday wasn't so much smarter cars as smarter roads"", thereby, in the 1950s, ""General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special test track"", of which the author explains to be ""embedded with an electrical cable that sent radio signals to a receiver on the front end of the car"". Though this did not exactly meet the idea of driverless cars, it still shows efficient progress. In addition, car companies began to manufacture cars that had more beneficial driving abilities. For instance, the author claims that ""the car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel"". The author also points out, ""This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" This example shows that, although these new vehicles are not completely self-driving, the development of smart cars has definitely improved; the sensors that are installed in the vehicles allow the driver to relax for a while while driving -- since the car is capable of driving itself under certain conditions -- which meets, though merely, the purpose of smart cars. The author of this article provides a variety of advantages and disadvantages of driverless cars. Nevertheless, the author seems to be more against the development of these cars rather than agreeing the process of it all. It surely has to be taken in consideration the fact that we do not have extremely advanced technologies yet that alow us to create and manufacture much more sofisticated things. As time advances, we will likely be provided with better knowledge and technology; it is all a matter of time in which our automakers will solve the variety of problems and faults that are at hand. Mankind is most definitely capable and we shall one day reach the destination of successfulness upon new inventions."

There would be a number of benefits if there was such technology availiable. This technology would not only benefit the students in more ways than one. If schools had technology that could read the faces of students and modify the lessons, it would increase the students chances of success. In the article, Dr. Huang claims, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" If the lesson was altered to improve the facial expression of the student, there is a huge chance that the student will become more engaged in the lesson, resulting in success. When a student is bored in a lesson, it is more than likely the student will not pay as much attention to it as well as they would if they were truly interested. Confusion may cause frustration which would lead to a more difficult learning process. A student who is actually interested in a certain lesson has more of a chance to become excited about the lesson, making the learning experience more enjoyable and easier to learn. In the article, Dr. Huang says, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" This being said, most students will more than likely not verbaly express when they dislike a certain lesson. Most would show their unhappiness through facial expressions. Because a teacher may not be able to fully read a students facial expression, it would be more effective if computers were availiable to read the expressions and alter the lesson for the student. Technology that is able to read the facial expressions of a student would benefit the student and the teachers. The student would be more engaged in the lesson, and the teacher would have a better understanding of what grabs the attention of his or her students compared to what drives his or her students away. The new technolgy would make a students more confident their skills, leading to a better, more successful educational system."
1175,0,"Venus could be dangerous but curious. NASA is willing to build a spacecraft to see what Venus is like. Although the spacecraft has not gotten anything from Venus. NASA has failed many times so they have not sent a spacecraft in decades. And that is one of the things that makes Venus dangerous. Venus is like ""Earth's twin"" they say. It used to have oceans like Earth. They had mountains, valleys, and craters. Although, they do have some danger too. Venus also has a very high temperature that goes up to 170 degrees Fahrenheit. They also have dangerous earthquakes and storms. NASA has tried to get rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. But they have failed and it was too risky that could put danger in lifes. Although NASA is studying and researching more and more so we could see the life in Venus. Which hopefully one day we all would see. Venus is very similar to Earth but does has its danger. Maybe one day, we could see pictures or rock or sands or Venus."
24045,0,"DEAR state senator i am writing this letter to argue in favor of keeping the electoral college and changing to election by polulor vote for the president of the united states. I beleve that we should keep it because peolpe and citizens have the right to vote for who they think would be a good leader for ower counrty. I think that we should keep it like this because if we dont have enugh peolple to vote there may be a 100% that there will be a tie. Like in 1976 there was a tie if a mere 5,559 voters in ohio and 3,687 voters in hawaii had voted the other way there wouldnt have been a tie. I do know that under the electoral college system, voters vote for the president,but for a slate of electors,who in turn elect the president. I also know that the peolpe who pick the electors in the firs place depend on the state. In conclution, i would like to make this argue because i think that we should be the ones that get the chance to vote for some one that i think we enough trust in please i hope that you understand the reason to why i am arguing in favor of keeping the electoral college and changing to election by populor vote for the president of the united states. thank you very much for receving my letter have a good day sincearly: PROPER_NAME"
21983,0,"The advantages of limiting car usage are that it saves time, conserves resources, lower emmisions and improve safety. Limited car usage will have a tremendous effect on our planet in a great way. It would help conserve our resources such as fuel. In the passage ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer paragraph sixteen it states that France has a tax policy tha favors the fuel diesel. Diesels make up sixty-seven precent of vehicles in France. Due to France's favor of diesel the carbon that is emitted into the air has created smog. Paris typically has more smog than any other European capitals because of these such emissions. france saw his as a problem in need of serious correcting. In attempts to reduce the smog the French had a ban on motor vehicles with few exceptions; sure enough the smog cleared and the ruling French party rescind the ban. Drastic efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailipes in Vauban, Germany have been put into order by creating an up-scale community that is ""Car-free"". As a result seventy precent of Vauban's families do not own cars. As said in paragraph eight of the passage ""In german suburb, Life goes on without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, ""emissions from n increasing number of private carsowned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities."" Sociologists believe this concept of car-free enviorments will have beneficial implicatins for carbon emissions and the enviorment, since transportations is the second largest source of emissions. there are critics such as the car industry that counter this idea because it could have negative implications on their business. Companies like Ford and Mercedes are already renaming themselves ""mobility"" companies with a broader product range other than the personl vehicle. Thousands upon thousands die in car acciddents every year. Cars are lethal weapons that caue misery to many involved or anyone who knew of someone in a car crashes. ""When i had a car i was always tense. im much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer that is living in a Car-free district. France even joined the trend by banning cars and making public transit free admission Monday-Friday. Car free areas are a good thinng. it would help the world so much. lowering pollutions and decreasing car crashes are one over the worlds major issues and this is the solutions. car-free cities is the answer. So people of the world, invest in walking shoes or a bicylce because this is the future, this is the beginning to "" going green"" to make a happier and safer world for its people."
15658,0,"I feel like the development of driverless cars are dangerous. Driveless cars are not promised to not malfuntion and get in an accident. Also the difficulty of making laws to fit driveless cars would cause a major problem. It will cause a big universal issue if driverless cars develop legally on the road. One issue with having a developed driveless car is the risk of the car malfuntioning and getting in an accident. Who is there to blame if the car malfuntions and kills someone? Neither the person driving the car or the company would want to take the blame. There isn't going to be a law that helps both driver and company. Another issue is the risk of getting trafic tickets. Who is to blame if the car speeds or runs a red light? A car with that much power could seriously hurt someone. There are possibilties of people falling asleep in front of the wheel and not being able to take control if something happens because they believe the driveless car is safe. Having a driveless car does not eliminate the risk of another careless driver smashing into them. It is a dangerous idea to have a driveless car. With saying all of that, i believe the idea of developing driveless cars is a mistake. There are enough problems on the road, adding driveless cars would just add more issues. The risk of accidents happening because of driveless cars is a disaster waiting to happen. The world will enventually be ruined because of advanced technology."
7939,0,"One of the latest innovations from Prof. Thomas Huang, of Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, may not be what you would expect. Facial Action Coding System, also known as FACS, is a software program that is designed to reconize the subtle facial movements that humans express. The use of Facial Action Coding System can be a beneficial part of a classroom, allowing teachers to be more engaged in their students and agenda. FACS would give teachers information of what their students are expressing, and help them develope a more perfected lesson plan. “Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,” notes Dr. Huang. This is an important factor, students most likely aren't going to be groaning everytime they get bored or distracted. Most students are too shy to even ask a question. FACS would be able to track six basic emotions, according to Dr. Paul Eckamn. Those expressions being happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Over time the system will be able to track when and where the students feel certian emotions, and be able to relay that information back to the teacher. Allowing for the teacher to see where his or her students are having issues. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,” Dr. Huang predicts. “Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This quote from the passage is the pinnacle of the argument to use FACS in a classroom. According to Dr. Huang, of the University of Illinois, facial expressions are universal for each emotion. When a body of students start to get confused, the teacher will be able to tell. With more specific data the teacher will be able to tell exactly where and when the students are getting lost. Effectivly, the teachers will be modifying the lesson plan on a classroom basis. This would be a monumental improvement for students across the world. In contrast, there is a counter to this arugment. The use of FACS in a classroom setting is only ever mentioned once, and it was merely an opinion of one of the researchers. There is no actual evidence that FACS will be able to relate facial expressions to the lesson plan. There isn't evidence that the teacher will benefit from knowing exactly where the students are falling. It's only a thought experiment at this time, but has a lot of potential. In conclusion, the use of FACS in a school enviroment could be a very powerful tool for teachers, allowing teachers to understand what their students are feeling and how to better their lessons. But it's not a tried and proven fact that it would work. FACS is still in its early stage of development, and has only been demonstrated once using a still image. It holds emense potential to do great things for the students of the world, but only time will be able to tell."

All technology has flaws, so why put that kind of technology in cars that go high speeds, where you dont know what could happen. The car could have a misfuction and drive off the road, or hit a telaphone pole. How would driverless cars know where there is ice and where there isnt any ice, where they could be going the speed limit on icy roads and slide into other cars, and harm them in the process. People do fine on there own without the help of driverless cars where so much could go wrong. Yes people do wreck sometimes to, but we all make mistakes and we arent going to stop that fro happening, because we arent perfect. It will be a whole different world if there are driverless cars, and why would we want to change that much in that short of time. Nothing is perfect so why take the change and risk peoples lives just to let the rich people have there fancy cars that can drive themselves. It doesnt seem right that normal people wont have the chance to drive one of these cars because they will cost so much money which not many people have millions of dollars to blow on one car that can create so much more danger and havic. So thats why i tthink that we shouldnt give the resonsibilities of humas to technology, which will only make thing worse in the end."
9171,0,"This technology in the classroom is not very valuable to the students and teachers. This system shows the students emotions by just looking at a computer. This system on the computers will be a waist of money and time can be useful in different places. Dr. Huang predicts in paragraph six,""A computer could recognize when a student is becomig confused,"" but is it worth spending so much money for a system like this? Teachers in the classroom can simply just ask the student on how they are feeling. That's it! Why would the student lie on how they are feeling? Letting the student state their own emotion is probably better because the teacher and a student can have a simple conversation rather than the teacher checking the students emotions. It's also none of the teachers buisness. Teachers don't need to know The teacher doesn't need to know how thier student is feeling, its the students buisness, not the teachers. This device can be useful to other people in the school building as well. For example, counsilors can use this if they want to run a test on their student to see how they are feeling. ""Most human communicationis nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" this can help counsilors help their student with a problem. In conclusion, this device on the computers are a waiste in the classroom and it will lead to less conversation from the student and the teacher. But it will help counsilors with their students with conecting emotions."

Fisrt it starts off when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face. Eckman has classified six basic emotions which are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness; yes it is like the that one movie we've all seen Joy. Even the smallest smile you give can indecate how you are feeling. For example when you smile people think are happy; when you fake smile people stillthink you are happy even though you might either be happy, sad, or mad. Or some people don't even have a smile and people think that they are mad even though they could be happy, some people just don't like showing it. There are many reason why people may not like showing how they really feel, some people don't like showing it because they may think they look weak. It is fine showing your emotions. Maybe they can let people know how they are feeling and it will get a lot better to let everything out, some kids don't like telling their parents how they feel, so maybe they can talk to a teacher who they actually trust. Some kids think no one understand them that is why some kids end up killing themselves. These are reason why technology should be used to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom."
12604,0,"The article ""Driverless Cars"" is about the stance on when and how driverless cars will be made and deploded onto the roads of the United States and elswhere. When I read the article I was fasinated by someparts of the story and not happy about other parts. I believe we shouldn't have driverless cars or have some version where we can turn on and off the driverless mode. If we have driverless cars I wouldn't buy one because it is so much easier to me in my opinion just to drive it on itself. The reason being is that I don't believe they will be as safe as they say. The reason I say that is because people might want to drive their own cars and people might not like computers controlling their every move. I personally think that since most of the world's population already know how to drive it will just have more deadly accidents. In the story it says ""The combination sof all this input is to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel."" They don't say it will improve human driving just that it will mimic. So why would we replace something that has worked for a hundred years with something that will work the exact same way and not improve it? I don't get it. Now I like that we have cars that will be able to make the roads safer with sensors. That's something we can capitilize on, not driverless cars that change nothing except the driver. Tesla will not release a car by 2016 because it is 2016 and I've not heard anything. The technologies not even there for people to drive on highways and it's a big waste of time on all those engineers when they can be making something to make this world better. I hope you all enjoyed this. If not I'm sorry and i don't realy care. So thanks for everything. This is why we shouldnt have driverless cars. Thanks for nothing."

Driverless carss can be an advance in technology to where if it gets a virus of some sort it will danger other humans. They could also do something that thier not suppose to like drive into a tree or off the road and into the river or lake. It is very unsafe for people to even be living thier. He believes that it can fundamentally change the world. They can not handle pulling in and out of driveways or deal with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through road work or accidents. Companies are making computer driven cars. Special touch sensors are installed into the cars. Google car simply announces the driver should be prepared to take over. A driverless cab to take you wherever you desire without you driving one bit sounds like bus drivers and cab jobs will be taken. Then the all cab and bus companies would shut down. Then it will get bigger to where they make heavy equipment vehicles. It will would then take over construction workers jobs. It will eventually take over truck drivers jobs as well. Then it will send familes and more people jobless and homless and possibly thier families to leave them. Although it sounds good to have driverless cars but it will ruin lives. It will take over alot of peoples jobs and lives making them homeless to where they can die of starvation. Any car cannot just drive on thier own without an accident reported or someone killed by the car malfunctioning. But I think the cars are a bad idea becauser technology dont ever work as good as it says. They always will crash or malfunction and they will always ruin someones life. They can ruin someones life bad enough to where it can be permanet. They will eventually have an accident and just kill someone because it cant handle certain conditions. They will also malfunction and drive its self into a tree or over a bridge or even into someones living room."

17018,0,"The author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. Although he presents boths aspects. I feel like he leans more towrds the idea that we are ready to try out and create driverless cars. I feel that people are still getting used to electronics and cars. So rushing into the idea of driverless cars is not a god idea. Maybe towards the future we can create and build on the idea but right now I feel as if that idea can wait. In the text it says ""In most states it's illegal even to test computer driven-cars."" This proves that the world is not quite ready for driverless cars. It also states in paragraph 9 that, "" If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault--- he driver or the manufacturer?"" If the technology fails people are bound to blame and sue the manufacturer. The will state that the technology fails and you aren't doing anything or they will say I want my money back. Who could blame them? If the technology fails then it is definitely the manufacturers fault. Not the driver. Human driven cars are safer because humans have control over the cars but if computers were to driver then they would not know the traffic laws. They will not know what to do at a construction site. There is no promise that the computer knows these things. They maybe little issues but if something were to go wrong. It could end up being a big issue over the littlest thing. Even though Sergey Brin believes that the world is ready for this next step and that he can envision it. I think he needs to look at the little isses and problems that may occur. Apple is send out new technology every year. Also every year people have to get used to the new technology and the idea behind it. So you send out a completely new idea on cars. How will people react? If these new cars get into more accidents who are the people going to blame? I think driverless cars should be an idea towards the future. So my position on driverless cars is that the idea can wait and that the idea is more an idea towards the future of human kind. I'll admit I love technology but even I think that driverless cars is a bit much. Let's focus on the problems right now."
24171,0,"Cars have been a part of our culture and society for a very long time now, but this might need to change as limiting the useage of care would lead to substancle benifets to our society. these benifets are a lowared carbon footprint, not having to spend as much on upkeep and lowared public transportation costs, and more closely knit communites with healtier people. To begin, limiting car usage would greatly reduce our carbon footprint thus help the enviorment. This is because emissions from cars produce around 12 precent of the greenhouse gasses in Europe and could be up to 50 percent in certain car-intensive areas in the United Sates. If we where to cut down on driving there would be a significant reduction in the pollution in the enviorment. Paris is already enacting laws around this where only people with odd license plates where able to drive one day and even plate numbered cars the other. This has lead to less congested roads and lower amount of smog in the city. Another draw to limiting car usage lies in lowered cost of public transportation and less money having to be spent on car upkeep and insurance. If people where to use more public transportaiton insted of personal cars people not have to worry about needing a car and insted keep the money that would normaly go to upkeep and insurance to use on other things. Furthermore if public transportation became more nessisary, then public transportaion will be cheaper such as in Paris where public transportaion became free for the week when they where testing the new law. Lastly with a reduction in car usage there would be better suburban planning like in Vauban, Germany and people getting more exsersize. Over in Vauban driving cars is severly limited so locations like shopping centers are a walk away from houses and the city is more closly knit with more bike and pedestrian paths. With people walking more that would help with the growing obesity problem Amarica is currently facing and could lead people to live healtier lifestyles In conclusion limiting car usage would be a very fruitful endevear because of the reduction of our carbon footprint, not having to pay car insurance and lowared cost of public tranportation, and more closly knit communities away from the roar of an engine the world would be much better off."
8268,0,"In the passage whether the use of the technolgy to read a emotional expression of students in a classroom,whether its vaulable or not is questionable because Da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely mostly enough to convey specific emotions. Although Your muscles called orbicularis pars palpabraeus that makes crow's-feet around your eyes, but the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and that uses a different muscle called the risorius. The muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling politician or when a celebrity isnt being trueful. In some cases, moving your facial muscles not only express emotions, but also help produce them. We unconsciously imitate anothers person's facial expression,but whoever is making the face could reveal so much about the science of emotion. In Conclusion, whether the use of this technolgy to read the emotional expression of students in a classroom is not valubale to me because some people could have a expression that makes them look angry when really thats just there normal face expression. So it can get face expression wrong no matter the technolgy. Also because it doesnt seem important to know how someone is feeling by facial expressions you should know how there feeling when you talk to them."

Throughout the article ''The Challenge of Exlporing Venus'' The author expresses the dangers and reasons why humans on earth have not been able to explore our neighboring planet. With that fact, the author still advocates for studying Venus and sites evidence for why this is needed. Overall, the author supports the study of the planet Venus because it's studies could inrich new knowledge about it to Earth. He supports this idea by stating Venus is similar to Earth, The study of Venis may allow fetaure pathways to increase it's study, and items learned form the experiment could lead to human settlement on the planet. The author's claim of studying Venis could inrich new knowledge to Earth is supported through the two planets being so similar to each other. This is so because according to the author the two planets at one time shared similar charcterisics ''The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountins and craters.'' (The Challenge of Exploring Venus, Paragrpah 5) This evidence is relevent to the claim because the author proved that Venis and Earth are alike. Just like Venis, Earth has valleys, mountins and craters. The author's goal is to use this information to better know what this planet is, why it's important, gaining better human knowledge about the panet. Futhermore the study of Venis is useful according to the author is because the planet could help NASA and other space comapnies in discovering the rest of outerspace. The author belives in if comapnies like NASA study space it would lead to better ways of getting more knowledge about the planet, '' Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribue meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus.'' (The Challenge of Exploring Venus, Paragraph 6). This is meaningful information because it supports inovation in space and what the author invesions of the future. The author's claim is support Venis can be a steepingstone into humans futher knowledge of space. This suports inriching new knowledge to Earth Finally the author's call for the study of Venus could inrich knowledge to earth because there is a chance that humans could settle on the planet. This can be said because the explorations of Venus could be survivable for humans, ''Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.'' (The Challenge of Exploring Venis, Paragraph 5) This information that the author gives is motivation for humans to discover the planet Venus because humans in the future could settle on the planet. This would support the claim because in the future if earth continues to have issues with climate change and globle warming there might be exploration to other planets. Having more knowledge about Venus could gives humans a chance in the distant future to inhabit a new planet. Overall the author suppirts inhabbiting Venus because he or she belives that humans on earth can benufit from it. The author sites in the article that the Earth and Venis are similar planets, increases in techonolgy could go along with the exploration and the study could give humans in the distant future to inhabbit Venus. So the aiuthor looks upright."
2035,0,"After reading ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the authors idea that study Venus is a worthy pursuit, did not meet all criterias. The author provided many facts about the planet Venus, but didnt give a clear explaination on why we should pursuit the study of Venus. In paragraph 8, the author's reason to pursuit the study of Venus was that ""our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation,"" the author has a valid point on that we should try to go beyond our limites, but he also relies on the fact of human curiosity and the gained insight of the planet itself. He does not take into concideration that we have attempted to explore Venus, but failed because the tempeter is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and has a pressure that is over 90 times greater then we have experienced. In paragraph 2 and 3, it shows that we know the risks of trying to travel to Venus, with many attempts that have failed, and with the information about the planets thick atmosphere, that is almost 97 perent carbon dioxide and clouds of sulfurice acid, one small mistake could cause the whole mission to fail. With the information we have now, we know that the planet Venus is curently changing and getting hotter, it includes that ""not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades."" In paragraph 5 and 6, it provides us with the information that even if we are able to travel to Venus, we would have to stay close to the sea level on Earth keeping us at a safe air pressure, we would have to be 30 or more miles above and the temperatures would still be around 170 degrees Fahrenheit. In conclusion the authors idea to travel to Venus does not lead anywhere, his claim is not well supported and is made up of him own curiosity and he does not give a vaild reason. Travling to Venus is not a worthy pursuit that we should do, without our imagination and innovation met, we are forced to work harder to achieve our goals and to do more."

I also think that if classrooms had this students will be able to comprehend what they have been taught and do well on test. In conclusion, I think that this would a very positive outcome if implemented in the school systems. It would probably help improve many grades and students will have an easy time learning.

24665,0,"In many places around the world people own cars and drive around almost every day. But what many people dont know is that cars can release harmful gases that can hurt the earth's environments. Three reasons why limiting car usage in your community is good is because it prevents traffic, it helps the environment and your community, and we dont really need cars to live our everyday lives. Limiting car usage in your community is good beacuse it prevents traffic. Everyday, people use their cars to go places even if the place their going to is down the street and that causes traffic some times. For example, in Paris there has been days of near-record pollutions due to traffic so Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air from pollution. They said every Monday motorist with even-numbered license plate were ordered to leave their cars at home or face a 22 euro fine. This ban helped because congestion dropped 60 percent in the capital of France just after five days of the ban was set. Another reason why limiting car usage in your community is good is because it helps prevent pollution to the air around you. Cars can release gasses that can harm the earths environment and the community around you. Which is why in the United States the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities much like the one in Vauban, Germany. These ""car Free"" communities consist of a small town where the usage of cars is illegal, you are not even allowed to own homes with a garge in it. This is very good for the environment and can prevent air pollution. We should limit how often we use cars because we dont really need them to get around and many countries beleive so too. For example in Bogota, Colombia there is a program that was set to spread out to other countries, during this program millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work. One reason why these people might have done this is because any one who violated this rule would have been fined $25 but the main goal for this was to prevent smog in their countries environment. The turn out however was huge! Even when there was rain it didn't stop them. The mayor of Bogota said ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating"" and now for the first time two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar joined the event. There are many reasons why we should limit the usage of cars in our communities because it prevents traffic, helps the environment and because we dont really need to use cars so often, take Colombia for example. So lets take action and follow the steps that many countires and communities are taking to help our communities."
10012,0,"Inventors are rapidly thinking of new ideas on how to improve the world. One idea might seem like an improvement, but how can we be positive nothing will go wrong. I believe driverless cars should not be manufactured because technology has downfalls. The idea of having driverless cars frightens me because we are relying on computers to safely drive us. In the article, the author says, ""but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents"". This is a issue because what if the driver has fallen asleep or the driver is not paying attention and wreckes the car. Again in the article it mentions how the driver would get bored sitting in his or her seat, so to fix that problem car manufacturers put in an entertainment system. An entertainment system is a disaster waiting to happen. Some states have made it illegal to test computer-driven cars. Other states have limited the use of semi-autonomous cars. I believe the reason for this is because technology is never one hundred percent safe. The way people use transportation today is perfect the way it is. If a malfunction occurs when the car is in drive, the driver might not know what to do and could cause an accident. Cars are safer being driven by a person because the driver is in control and not an almost reliable computer."

You sing, you talk, and you laugh, but the biggest thing you do is make memories. Now imagine you are doing all of this while your car is driving itself. What happends when something goes wrong and an accident occurs and you can no longer make these memories with your family anymore. Driverless car pose many threats in todays society. They suggest lazyness and take the fun out of driving. They can't without any certain stop all car accidents that happen on a day-to-day basis. They also can be unrelistic. For these reasons why, driverless cars are not a nessasary item to have in the future. To start off, a driverless car would impose lazyness for the person who opperates it. How would you tell who can opperate one and who can't? How would you have a driver's test if the car drives itself? That also takes the fun out of learning how to drive also. Yes, it would be easier and less work but then you would not have the memories that come with learning how to drive and the feeling of learning and experiencing something new that you will use for the rest of your life. Memories that you won't have if your car does all the work. The next reason why driverless cars are not a practical invision is because they are not completely driverless. In the article the writer states, ""... the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over..."". That means that sleeping while driving would not be safe nor would interacting while on the road. All you would be doing is driving with no hands acentually. The article also bring's a point about if an accident were to accure, who would be to blame? Would it be you or the manufacturer? If someone is injured who do you put the blame on? The person with there hands at there sides or a huge manufacturing company like GM? The practicallity of a car thar drives itself is another reason why driverless cars are a negitive, not a posituve want for the future. My last reason for why a driverless car is a negitive rather than a positive is the fact that they are unrealistic and unpractical. The average day person can't afford a BMW or a car made by google. So how do these companies think that a car that drives itself would not be the same? The article also makes a point to say, "" Mercedes-Bens, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020."" Two things stick out in that sentence, one being that all three of those car brands are labled as luxuary cars, and second being that this dream car would not be accessible until the year 2020. For this reason why i believe a driverless car is a dream only meant to come true in a Jenson's episode, rather than everyday life. To conclude, a driverless car would be easier in a way that you would have a little more lee-way to move in your car more, like to get that fry you dropped inbetween the console and your seat for example. But, it would also take the memory of dropping that fry in your car.They would make you feel lazy, could also cause more trouble if you were to ever get into an accident, and they are not practical for an average day Joe. For these reasons I believe that a driverless car would be a strong negative rather than a positive."
949,0,"Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky and human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Venus's knickname is sometimes called the ""Evening Star"" mainly because Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth has proved a very challenging place to examine closely. It is also called the ""Evening Star"" because Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. On Venus, the temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than on Earth. These conditions are far more extreme than anything human would encounter on Earth. It is not suprising that the temperature average is so high given the fact that Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. So basically, if you walk on Venus you will get burns. Studying Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky because it is simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot. Yes, Venus has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely, but although it is not clear due to the fact that 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus, it is still simple to see from the distant, safe vantage point. No spacecraft survived for more than a few hours because of the carbon dioxide blanketing clouds of Venus. The clouds of Venus most likely explains why not a single spacecraft torched down on Venus for more than three decades. Venus's atmosphere at night is not affected by carbon dioxide of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. This is exactly why studying Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky is simple for an amateur stargazer to spot. Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Venus has value because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself just like intimidating endeavors does as well. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts, it should only be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. This helps to strive to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value. So, because our travels should not be limited by dangers and doubts, intimidating endeavors should only be expanded to meet the imagination and innovation of the travel. So, because Venus is simple to see from the distant and because our travels should be expanded, studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because it only presents a small amount of dangers. So, If Venus was more of a dangerous planet to explore, walk on, and study, would this be a planet that everyone would be interested to study and afraid to walk on to explore?"
21270,0,"Throughout the past century car usage has exploded; from a luxury available only to the highest echelon of society to a tool almost essential to life. Although cars are convenient there are many downsides to having them. Some reasons a society that limits car use could be beneficial are: expenses, environmental costs, and health degredation. Hopefully together we can curb car usage and lead the way for a cheaper, greener, and healthier future. Its a known fact that cars are expensive, but when you add up all of the costs how much is really spent. Especially for younger drivers; insurance is a ludicris expense, often totalling hundreds of dollars per month. Another expense, obviously, is gas. Gas may be at a 5 year low right now but the slightest instability in oil producing countries could cause prices to skyrocket. Still if you add in the cost of the car your looking at a highly expensive way of living. Life obviously could be less expensive without car use. Another illeffect of car use is environmental impact. car emmisions are responsible for up to 50 percent of total green house gas emmisions in some states. Using cars is not good for the environment. Cars pollute are atmosphere and can accelerate the rate of ozone layer deteorioration. They also, indirectly, damage habitats by requiring new roads and highways to be built thus disturbing ecosystems. Automobiles also use large quantities of petrolium; a finite and ever neccesary resource in this global world. Car usage needs to be drastically reduced in order to preserve the environment. Health issues can also develop from overusing cars. For instance, by looking at cultures that do not use cars it is evident that less children with autism are born to said peoples, such as the Amish. Another benefit of not using cars is exercise. People that drive instead of walking or bicycling are not only becoming more obese they are also putting themselves at an elevated risk for heart disease. Car accidents are one of the highest causes of premature death in the united states; thus if people drove less these accidents would occur far less often. The choice seems clear; a carless society is more healthy for all. All in all, although cars may have benefits, the drawbacks of having them far out way any of said benefits. Car usage is expensive, bad for the environment and unhealthy. Together, society must ultimately decide whether life with automobiles is worth it and live with the consequences."
18584,0,"Driveless cars have been a fantasy on television and in media, but in many ways, they have evolved into what could be a distant reality. As the author states, Google has been working on driveless cars since 2009. For cars that drove half a million miles without crashing, it is a remarkable step into what could be a possible evolution for cars. There might be questions and concerns on safety, but there is much thought put behind such measures. For cars to drive on their own efficently, sensors must be put into place for the driveless car to imitate a human driver. The article states that over the past years, sensors have improved to respond to dangerous, out-of-control situations. As advancements head way, sensors on cars are becoming even more reliable and safe. Even if a car could drive itself, applications and abilities such as texting can be turned off for even more safety reasons, according to manufacturers. Such as laws against texting while driving were made, laws will need to be put in place to ensure the safety of people. In this moment and time, cars are safer in the control of humans; to avoid confict with manufacturers and drivers, driveless cars are still not available for the public. But technology still continues to improve. So much so, Tesla is presenting a 2016 model that can drive by itself for ninety percent of the drive. Other companies such as Audi, Mercedes-Benz, and Nissan plan on producing driveless cars in the close future. Cars that drive themselves may seem hazardous, but in the distant future they will be able to eventually become safe. Driveless cars are becoming a reality for many technology companies and are plausable for an innnovative way of transportation. There are many safety concerns, but as they are being kept in check, fear of mistakes should fall. There are many steps that go into the car for safety measures, such as sensors. Though they are still in the making, driveless cars are an exciting and plausable mode of transportation that will change the world forever."

10183,0,"The Believe of Driverless Cars Do you believe that it is best to use driverless cars in our country today. Yes, I believe that if we use drivreless cars today in our country it will be more safer than just manual driving. The reason I say that is because people in our generation today is distract by every thing they see, but machine don't get distract by nothing. This is why driveles cars are safer than manual driving. Driverless cars are also more useful, by give the driver opportunity to do things in the car. Like if the drive have kids they can tend to their child while the car drive by itself. Another reason it is more useful if your running late and you doing stuff to your hair or putting on make-up. The car can takeover while you do what ever you have to do. This is how the car is useful to the driver when the driver is busy with personal stuff they might be going through. Driverless cars are also better because you can program a place you want to go and you don't feel like driving you can just let the car drive for you. Or you want to travel to somewhere far and you feel sleepy. You can let the car keep driving until you wake up to drive yourself. This is how driverless cars is better than manual driving. You don't have to stop every time you feel sleepy and you can get there at a nice pace in time. Another reason why driverless cars are better is because they will be program with google, so you can know where your going and don't have to continue stopping to look at a map every hour or have to follow signs. The car will do everything for you. This is how driverless cars are much better then other cars. Plus they are more advance then regular cars and are much better. This is how we make our country more safer today in this generation. In conclusion, driverless cars are made to protect humans while they are driving. Driverless cars can make a diffence that everyone will love. Everyone just have to be smart and make this work for the better. There will be less crashes and fewer deaths in the world if we have driverless cars. This will also be great for the U.S.A."
10052,0,"Driverless cars have been in development in some form since the 1950s, when General Motors created a car that could run by itself on a specific test track. However, driverless cars on regular motorways began to be practical just recently. Google has specifically been working on driverless cars in these conditions since 2009 and these cars have driven over 500,000 miles without crashing. However, their cars aren't fully driverless; when something out of the ordinary happens while driving, the car alerts the driver to take over. Even so, driverless cars are starting to be thought of as viable alternatives to traditional automobiles. There are some setbacks within the idea of a driverless car. As aforementioned, most cars in development that are ""driverless"" still need human drivers behind the wheel to take over if road conditions become unusual. Also, the development of these cars requires much more funding to equip each car with the sensors it needs to effectively mimic human driving skills. In the modified Toyota Prius made by Google, the sensors needed included ""position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor"". This would force car manufacturers to spend much more money so that these driverless cars would be fully functional. However, technology in this day and age is extremely advanced, much more so than in the 50s with the first attempt at driverless car manufacturing. This advancement in technology makes it much easier for today's car manufacturers to start implementing driverless technology in their cars. In driverless cars, there is also the issue of fault in accidents. While Google's aforementioned cars have driven over 500,000 miles without crashing, there is always the chance of technological failure. If a driverless car gets in an accident with a normal automobile, there could be very heated conflicts and lawsuits involving the two drivers and the manufacturer of the driverless car. However, the benefits involved with driverless cars outweigh the setbacks. One major benefit involved with driverless cars is the fact that driverless cars effectively eliminate human error, specifically drunk driving. Thousands of people are killed or injured every year by drunk or intoxicated drivers. Also, if no accident occurs, the drunk or intoxicated drivers operating these vehicles are sometimes pulled over and arrested by law enforcement. A relatively new app called Uber allows a smartphone user to contact an Uber driver to pick them up and take them to their destination. It is effectively a personalized taxi service. Uber is used very frequently by drunk or intoxicated people that otherwise would not have a way to get from place to place, eliminating the hazards to the general public of drunk driving. Driverless cars would helps eliminated accidents involving drivers who are drunk or intoxicated in the same way that Uber does. Another major benefit of driverless cars is that if driverless cars were used in public transportation, these services would be benefitted greatly and help many more people. One of Google's cofounders, Sergey Brin, envisions a future of public transportation using driverless cars as a fleet of public-transport taxis. These cars, or at least the ones he envisions would use half the fuel of the taxis used today and would be far more flexible and personal than the buses used today. This driverless taxi system offers a far better alternative to both today's taxi system and today's bus system. Driverless cars are becoming a major innovation in both the automotive and technological industry. While there are some potential setbacks involved with the development of these vehicles, driverless cars effectively reduce and/or eliminate human error from roadways and offer a viable alternative to bus services, taxi services, and drunk drivers."

Im about to give you some every important information you need to know w\about Venus/Evening Star. The detailes that author gives you is incredible he tells you everything you need to know. The evidence is information like its referred to as Earth's twin. Venus is the closest planet to earth in terms density an size. Venus is out of a thick atmosphere of alomst 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets. Even NASA wants to send people to study the planet Venus. NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus. He tells you everything you need to know about Venus. There devices they use were first envisioned in the 1800s. it sounds shocking but its true. If I was you if you want to learn more about it get into deeper articles about it. The conclusion on this article is that Venus it a plant that should be study on or even looked at. Because you never know what you could find on that plant. They think it might have value into it an i think they are right. Just because it might be dangerous or even doubts on dying. Its ok to take resk on something that could or can change the world inot something different.
22435,0,"In the recent years the state of the country has been a major issue. The enviornment is a growing concern and the econmic condition of the citizens is a pressing matter. One way the alliviate the stress on these factors is to limit car use. Doing so will help the enviornment by limiting greenshouse immisions, and not having a car all together or limiting car use will save money for those who are econmicly weak. Limited car use would alliviate all these problems. The enviornment houses us along with everything that supplies us with the means to live. In recent years that has been under attack by pollution. Acording to Robert Duffer one of the major issues of Paris, France is the increasing smog and pollution that has decended upon the city. The level of pollution rivaled the most polluted cities in the world: Beijing China. In order to combat the smog French officals have placed a ban on drving, and for those that chose to disobey recived a fine. The smog then cleared up to allow the ruling French party to rescind the ban. This should be an example for highly poluted areas everywhere. Not only does this perserves the enviornment but it also takes the health and well being of citizens into account. The limited use of cars would help those who are finacialy weak to strengthen themselves, because not having to use money to pay for the expenses of a car would leave you money to take care of other necessities. Elisabeth Rosenthal wrote that in some German suburbs there is 70% of the people residing there that do not have cars. And there is only a few places where they can be parked, and for the places that allow parked must be purchased for 40,000 dollars, along with a house. Just not having a car itself would be much more affordable! 57% of the people who live in that suburban area sold their cars to move there. As shown by Rosenthal's report, not having a car would prove to be more econmicaly sound and benifital especially to those who are struggling. There are many advantages to the limiting of the usage of cars. For one thing it aids the enviornment by adding less pollutants into the air, which harm the enviornment and the people in it. Also people that use their cars less save money, which would benifit those whoa rent in the best possible econmic situation. Many say that limiting the use of acars would prevent many from going to work, school and other obligagtions, but there are other means of transportaion including bikes, buses, subways and monorails. Think of the disadvantages to excessive car use, high pollution, expensive expenses such as gasoline and maintence of the car. Limited car use would remove all these burdens."
15900,0,"My position on driverless cars is that it is a good idea. It will prevent more accidents. An it has a lot more sensors. An the car still makes the human pay attention just in case its needs help and cannot handle the difficult problem by its self. In the 1980's automakers created antilock brakes to help prevent accidents form happening. Another one was within 10 years, they where more advanced to detect and respond the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. It resonds better than a human can while driving. An for those reasons are why accidents happen less often. This car has so many sensors to help the car from running in to something or from having something happen. For instance it has a sensor everywhere u can think of. This car even has a sensor for when it cant handle a difficult problem that it alerts you so u can help. the car viberates and also has a flashing light to alert you. So those are just some of the reasons why i think its a good idea to have a driverless car."

This technology would be great for school education, maybe in college. It could be a new subject for a science class. For these six emotions for the class, it would be a great class to pass a high school class. Doing this is pretty cool to do. Out of all the science classes and math classes it could prove that emotions for humans would be great. That is what we should do for the future science class talking about emotions.

18966,0,"Driverless cars have facinated the mind of many, old and young alike. Whether one like it or not, a future with driverless cars seems inevitable. In truth, many car companies and even Google, have started projects on driverless car. Then, what about the people, the customers? Can everyone accept the idea of driverless car? I for one, am rooting for the developments of driverless cars. I believe that driverless cars can be and will be safer than traditional cars. Google's car for example, even though it can only run under specific conditions, have gone more then half a million miles without a crash. Even though the car still need human control under certain circumstances, half amillion miles with out a crash is impressive. For normal human, I believe it will be hard. Moreover, we have been using machines to help us in everyday life. Too much in fact, that it has become our lifestyle. Be it Micro-wave oven in the kitchen to our computers, we rely heavily on machines. And these machines perform better than ourselves. The driverless car will also be like these machines. In fact, the advancement in sensors have allowed cars to be braked on individual wheels and engines with far better response and control. This show that machines perform better than humans. There is also the economic factor. Google co founder Sergey Brin envisions fleets of driverless cars forming a public-transport system. He believe these would use half the fuel today's taxis uses and have far more flexibility than a bus. When the world is struggling for natural oil, these cars only need half of the fuel modern cars need. That is a huge econimical advantage for everyone. Although driverless cars will offer many benefits, making one is a hard task. Driverless cars today still need human's attention. Still, automakers are thriving towards the goal of making a self-driven car. This goal may seems far away, but we are moving towards it everyday."

But, there are a few downsides to all this new technology. Google cofounder Sergey Brin sees a bright future with public transportation. In paragraph one of ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" it says, ""He envisions a future with a public transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public-transportation taxi system. The cars he forsees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more felxibility than a bus. He believes such cars would fundamentally change the world."" All these improvments in technology and cars could change the way we live. There are some downsides to all this great technology, sadly. The passage states in paragraph two that ""Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash, but so far, Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigation through roadwork or accidents."" Also in paragraph seven it states, ""In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skils."" These driverless cars do still need assistance in a few things to where you have to stay alert while driving but, besides that, this new technology will change the lives of many people. I am personally all for the driverless cars. The less I have to drive would make it much easier on me. I would love if within the next 10 or 20 years, we get it to where we don't have to do any assitance with the driverless cars and we could just sit back and enjoy the ride. In conclusion, driverless cars and all this new technology impacts many people of all ages. Some people believe it's for the better and some believe it's not. It is a matter of opinion. But I believe that everyone would love to have these driverless cars. It saves on fuel, there would be less traffic accidents, and many other great improvments that could save the lives of others."

Its a bad idea to modify a computer to read peoples emotions because when a kid is doing there homework and the kid is bored the computer is going to detect that the kid is bored from doing his/her homework and put a add with a video game and the kid is going to get distracted and fail the assingment."

Whats to say the car is driving itself and when it switches to manul and the drivers not paying attention, or if the sytem is not working right and it does not alert the driver to turn or break. There are a lot of things that can go wrong. But on the other hand there is a lot that can go right. The sensors in the cars could allow the car to break long before the driver can react. These sensors can stop drivers from backing into things. the gps and 3D mapping could allow drivers to avoid crashes and avoid contrustion on roads. This would save drivers a lot of time. In closing I do believe that these cars are safe but to an ectend because they can not fully drive themselves."

10674,0,"I think that driverless cars should not be made becuase there are a variety of issues that can happen with them and that come with them. If we had driverless cars then we would still need the driver to be at full alert because anything could happen. The dirver is already alert when driving why do we need a self driving car that requires us to still be fully alert. The driverless car requires a driver to take over in case something goes wrong so people will still need to know how to drive a car and will still be required to get a liscense. So if driversless cars are made then people are in a car that is the same if you were driving it. You have to have full attention, which defeats the purpose of having a driverless car because when people think driverless car they think they can do whatever they need to do and the car will drive itself, but thats not the case you will still have to have full attention. Another issue with drverless cars is morality. Many people might not put this problem into consideration but it should be. If someone was about to get into a crash and they had passengers in their vehicle the car would take over as it would have a faster reaction time. The problem with that, is what morals will the car go by? The car will have to make a decision that will be based on the best result not morals. So the car would have to either choose to save the passengers at the cost of the driver or to save the driver at the cost of the passengers. These choices are not meant to be made by machines that determine which choice they make with data. The driverless car has negatives that come with it if they are made. They are expensive, they have to have a human at full attention ready to drive in case of a situation, which defeats the purpose of a driverless car, and there are morality issues with the driverless car."
6147,0,"The use of the technology that can read emotional expressions of students in a classroom would be extremly valuable. This technology would be so valuable because it would not only help teachers see when students are confused or lost but then the computer could modify the lesson to help the student learn the best way possible. Plus this technology is active and working right now. The use of technology to read emotions would greatly benifit students. It would allow teachers to provide even more help when a student is struggling with the assiginment or the lesson. Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, has been working on a way for a computer monitor to read human emotions. Dr. Huang says that, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This would allow for every student to learn in the best way possible, because when their is only one teacher, that said teacher will only teach the lesson one way and expect everybody to learn it that one way. Although in reality everybody learns differently, some students learn best through hands on learning while others may learn the best through seeing examples of how to do the disired task. The point is that, everybody learns differently and if a computer can modify each lesson to fit the learning styles of students, students would not only learn better and faster, they may also enjoy learning a little bit more. Which would then help with attendance issues and people not wanting to go to school because it just being ""dumb"" or not fun. Plus this technology is also already working and has been improved on. In ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" written by Nick D'Alto in 2006, says that, ""She’s 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" D'Alto is refering to the Mona Lisa painting. These said percents, 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, etc, were only able to be obtained through the latest innovation on a new computer software. (Keep in mind that the article was written in 2006.) With technology that can read emotions extremly well in 2006, just imagine how much farther it can come in 12 years. The technology has been sure to have advanced, to it being even accurate. This would teachers to know what students are thinking and how they can help them or how the computer can modify the lesson for the student to help them learn in the best way possible. With technology becoming more advanced by the day, why not advance the technology in our classroom's to help benifit the students. The use of technology to read a sudents emotions would grealty benifit the student and if it is benifiting the student why not use it. If this new technology helps students learn better and faster would'nt it be wrong for it not to be used. If this technology is available for schools, schools should invest it this technology to help the student learn faster and quicker."

If there truly is or was life of Mars, why would this massive rock be a sign of it? The earlies picture of the face is an extremely low quality and blurry image taken by a really old camera. Even in the picture from 1976, to me it just looks like a rock, which it is. Newer photos show the intricate cracks and molding on the landmass, there's even 3D models showing what it really is. There is absolutely no way this is something created by a living being. Just look at the size of it! Well, I guess you can't tell how big it is from the photos, but it's miles long. There is nothing that could exist with enough power to make something this huge, yet leave nothing behind to show us proof of foreign lifeforms. So many consistencies in this evidence has to convince anyone skeptical that the Face is just a rock. Got it? I hope you learned something today."
7089,0,"There is software that can percieve peoples emotions. The software which goes by the name, the Facial Action Coding System, can detect feelings accurately. Some uses of this new technology is astounding. But would it really be helpful in the classroom? While this new technology seems promsing, it just wouldn't work in the classroom. This is due to the technology being inaccurate, flawed, and inconsistent. First off, the Facial Action Coding System could allow teachers in schools to modify lessons but that doesn't mean it will help matters at all. For example, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" While this technolgy can read the emotions and help notice when the lesson needs to be modified, that doesn't mean it will prevent students from becoming bored and actually get information from the lesson. Especially when its taken into considerstion that there are usually twenty to thirty students in the classroom. What may help one student doesn't always apply to the other twenty or so students in the class. Therefore the technology seems flawed as it can apply to one student but not necessarily twenty to thirty students. Also, the Facial Action Coding System can be inaccurate like all technolgy. Human beings are very off sometimes when attempting to read emotions. Who says technology can be any better. The passage shows, ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."" This example shows how humans misinterpret emotions. Technology can easily do the same thing. Another example of this is the Mona Lisa painting. The text states,""The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do."" This example shows that the technology can be inaccurate because the technology may recieve one range of emotions from the painting, a person could recieve a completely different set of emotions. This example could very well apply to a student in class because everything is different from student to student. In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System seems promising in a classroom but seems very flawed, inconsistent, and inaccurate. Students may or may not benefit from their emotions being read and lessons being changed in the classroom. Each student is different, so one change will not benefit all students."

17691,0,"Driverless cars would be pointless to invest in. They promote people to make laws for the vehicles which is a smart idea, but that could promote some drivers that can test them to be less concered behind the wheel. Driverless cars would still have a driver in it, and driverless cars would be very expensive. Making laws for using semi-autonomous is a good idea to limit usage of it and illegalizing it is better. Testing a car that may not be relible can endanger other people on the road. Especially if someone may be careless behind the wheel. Another reason why I would not invest into a car is becasue they are too expensive and you would still have to be behind the wheel. If you can test it, then you can only be behind the wheel while the car drives itself, you can't even be in a car that cannot fully drive itself at all time. The other issue is the cost of the vehicle. A driverless car is not going to be easily affordable. They want a lot of people to be getting it but it is not even worth getting. Not many people would be able to afford a vehivle over $80,000. People would not like to drive and have to all of a sudden controll or take over the wheel. ""'The psychological aspects of automation are really a challenge,” admits Dr. Werner Huber, a BMW project manager driver. “We have to interpret the driving fun in a new way.'"" If other manufacturers try to make a system to where you can shut it off, it would make the risks of getting into a car accident higher than normal.

You also should not invest into it because it will promote careless drivers in the future."
11071,0,"Driverless cars are the future of transportation. The technologies that we have right now limit us in what we can do in the field of driverless cars but sometime in the near future we will have fully driverless cars. Car engineers are already pushing the envelope on what they put in cars as far as technology and computer systems. There has also been a rise in the number of cars that are running with electric engines, which will be necessary to driverless cars. These three pieces of evidence are all reasons why cars of the future should not require an active driver. The technologies that we have today are amazing to older generations that thought that having a car was crazy. Even with our advanced technologies we still do not have advanced enough technolgies to have fukky driverless cars. As the passage stated, ""Google cars arent truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents."" This statement shows that even companies that have the latest and greatest technologies are not able to make a truly driverless car. Even though we are not able to make a fully driverless car today, our technologies are still advancing at a higher rate than ever before. The technologies that we have in cars toaday are truly amazing and extremely advanced compared to what the standard of technology was in a car ten years ago. That is because car engineers are working their hardest to put as much technology as possible in the cars that they are making. The 2017 Ford Focus is supposed to be able to park for you and it is able to tell you when you are okay to change lanes on the interstate. Tesla has projected for a car to come out this year that is supposed to be 90 percent driverless. These are just two examples of car engineers trying there hardest to put the most technology in vehicles as they can. As you can see this is being done by both luxury brands, such as Tesla and BMW, and by everyday brands, such as Ford. One of the main problems with running a carr that is completely driverless is that there needs to be a main frame that the cars computer systems can run off of, and that main frame starts with an electric engine. Almost every car company now a days makes at least on vehicle with a completely elctric engine. This is good that electric engine cars are starting to be made usable and can now start to be perfected because electric engines are necessary to a fully driver less car. A fully driver less car will have a lot of computer systems that are necessary to opperate the vehicle. These computer systems will all need a main frame to run off of which means the majority of the car is going to be elcetric anyways. Wouldn't it make sense for the engine to be on the smae page as the rest of the car. Just think, instead of you have to go fill up your fully driverless car with gas and then having to go charge it, you could go charge it and refuel the engine at the same time. The technolgies to make a fully driverless car are not avalable to us yet but they will be in the near future. Car engineers are already making cars partially driveless so it is only a matter of time until they are fully driverless. Electric engines are already found in a lot of cars and they would be necessary in a fully driverless car which means we are going in the right direction. It is only a matter of time until we will have all of the technologies necessary to have fully driverless cars. So the question is, will you be picking up your next car from the dealer ship or will it be driving to your home?"

Yes, a driveless car may be fun and easier to do things that you usually can't do when driving. You could eat, talk on the phone, do your make - up and more, but is it safe? Are you guaranteed no accidents when using this car, are you guaranteed that the car won't take a wrong turn and get lost? What happens when there is road work or a street is blocked off? You'll have to take over and go the right way or turn around. So, in some cases you'll have to drive your driveless car. So why buy it? This car doesn't seem fun or safe to me. Like the article said,'' safety is best achieved with alert drivers.''. With that being said, I think it's best to drive the old fashioned way. Learn how to drive, get your driver's liscense, get a car, and drive it. It's safer that way and it's much cheaper that way."
7885,0,"I strongly believe that the use of this technology to read students' emotional expressions is a good idea. This use of technology can be very useful and valuable for many reasons. The first reason why would be because if a student does not understand the material effectively, the computer can identify this and try to make the problem a little easier for the student. In prargragh six it states, "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang. "" So computers need to understand that, too.""This could help students pass classes because the teacher can not know if everyone is understanding the material all at the same time. The second reason would be because this technology could prevent suicide or other serious case senarios..""In paragragh six it also says, "" Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad."" This means that the computer would be able to indicate if a student was sad or angry. If the computer indicated this kind of feeling upon the student everyday, then the teachers would be able to talk to the student to try and figure out why they are so sad or angry. These talks could prevent a student from making that bad decision. The final reason would be because it could prevent a sickness from occuring. Sometimes you can tell when a person is about to have a seizure or heart attack just by their facial expressions. By the computer being able to indicate that, it could save someones life. In paragrapgh one it states, "" Dr. Huang and his colleagues are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate."" When a person is sick or having a health issue they may not be able to talk and tell you that they are having an issue, so this technology could identify this behavior and give the teacher a sign or warning that there is something wrong. Some people may not want their teachers to know what their emotions are, but I strongly believe that having this new technology will keep kids safer, and smarter in a various number of ways."

I mean, sure the driverless car seems so convienient and everything, but if you still have to pay attention to the road then what is the point? Driverless cars may seem great, but they truly are not. So many teenagers are foaming at the mouth practically to get there license when they turn 16, and some people just love to drive in general. They would not want to be driven around by a computerized car. Driving yourself around is a passion for some people. I personally do not think driverless cars should be a thing. Technology is always getting bigger and smarter, but will it truly be smart enough to simulate the thought process of a human brain in a bad situation while driving? It does not seem very likely. While there are many pros to driverless cars, there are also cons. One of the main cons that comes to mind when I think of a driverless car is the safety of it. I mean sure, they may be proven to be safe, but almost all technology messes up at somepoint. How can the creators of driverless cars say that they are completely safe. For all they know there could be an unknown glitch in their server and it could cause the car to crash and the driver to die. Also, in the article they said they use a lot of sensors and radars to simulate that of the human vision. What if one accidentally broke or malfunctioned, but continued to drive seemlessly without error? As mentioned in the article, the driver could be using one of the entertainment systems that they build into the car to occupy the driver while the car is self-driving; consequently, they may neglect to see a car in front of them and crash because they were distracted by the entertainment system, and then there is a possible human life lost. Who would be at fault then? Would the company that made the car be responsible? Or how about the driver who was distracted by the car's entertainment systems? No matter who is at fault for the wreck, the wreck could have possbile been avoided if there was a human driver behind the wheel. These are jsut a couple of the many safety concerns that come with the possibility of driverless cars. While they may be advanced, futuristic vehicles, they seriously be thought about before trusting a human's life with them; consequently, I think they should be kept off of the roads until they are proven 100% safe. I really do not think driverless cars are a good idea until they can prove that the technology that goes into them will run 100% error free and not malfunction. Until that happens they should not allow them on the roads just for the sake of human lives being at risk. All it could take is a single crash, and while I know that hasn't happened yet, it is bound to and a human life will be lost; therefore, I say keep them off of the roads. Driverless cars are not for us until we can prove that they will not glitch or mess up and crash."

Driverless Cars Would Have Negative Aspects Do To The Fact That The Driverless Cars Can Not Navigate Work Zones Or Go Around Accidents Without A Driver.

In Order To Even Have Driverless Cars We Have To Have An Earth To Keep Them On. Global Warming Is Basically Over Heating Our Earth And Is Caused By Many Things Including The Gases That Come From Cars. Using Half The Fuel Of Today's Cars For A Far More Better Transportation Sounds Pretty Good To Me. My Second Reason, They Offer Far More Flexiblity Than A Bus, Is Because Buses Have Certain Routes And They Hold More Than One Person.

Last But Not Least A Driverless Car Is Not Able To Go Around Accidents Without A Driver. This Means That The Driverless Car Would Either Do Three Things If Confronted By A Accident. It Would Either Cause A Big Traffic Jam, Cause Another Accident, Or Even Cause Angry Citizens. Everyone Knows An Angry Citize Is Not A Nice Citizen. Then If There Is Already A Traffic Jam Due To The First Accident And A Driverless Care Cant Get Around It, That Would Cause A Huge Traffic Jam. All In All Those Were My Reasons Why Driverless Cars Are Both Positive And Negative Aspectd. The Positive Aspects Would Be That It Uses Half The Feul Of Today's Taxis And It Offers far More Flexibility Than A Bus. The Negative Aspects Would Be That They Cant Go Around Work Zones Or Accidents Without A Driver."
24724,0,"What you are about to read is going to give you insight on the advantages and disadvantages there are when talking about limiting car usage. In the next few paragraphs and sentences I am going to state true facts about the advantages and disadvantages of limiting your forms of transportaion. I will also talk about not just the individual advantages and disadvantages, but I will also talk about how it could help or hurt, a community. Now strap down, let's click on those seat belts, and go for a ride, all puns intended. I think it would probably be best if we started this paper off by talking about the disadvantages right off the bat. Now, the first one that I think everyone thought of right away would be that of, how could places like the United States of America, a country that is thousands of miles wide, convert to what is being proposed in these articles? Where I live now is on the ocean, so on the outskirts of our city, LOCATION_NAME, to be exact. If our county, LOCATION_NAME, was to change to this ideal, then we would have to bike about 3 miles just to get to the bridge to get across the river back to main land. Another example would eb that where I used to live, LOCATION_NAME, there was a lot of land seperating my old house and the main drag of my town. In the summer, it wouldn't be that big of a deal to just take a bike and gon on a bike ride, but when it came around to it being winter I would probably want to take a car that had 4x4 wheel drive, if you catch my drift. I think that the disadvantages are painfully obvious when it comes to this system, but I could definetley see it working in large citites not unlike Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, and so on. Now that we've finally gotten the disadvantages out of the way, we can talk about how this would help communitites all across the world become safer and cleaner. In the first article I read a quote that I thought was perfect for the advantages paragraph. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happer this way,"" (Paragraph 2, Lines 4-5) This really got my attention right from the get go because It made me think about our daily lives and how I feel when I'm behind the wheel. Im always stressed Im going to wreck my car! The other thing that caught my eye was when I read about the Columbian city of Bogota. In Bogota, they banned all motor vehicles except buses and taxis for a day. A businessman was quoted as saying ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" It seems that when the idea of outlawing all motor vehicles and having only bikes and your feet for transportation, people are a lot happier. In conclusion, I would love to see less cars on the roads, and see more people switch to greener alternatives such as bikes, skateboards, feet, etc. I think it would also take care of the issue of obesity and pollution. The only thing that I find hard to believe is that we would just disband the use of cars all together. I think that we have built so many roads all over the place that finding another use for them would be hard. All in all however, I think this is a great idea. To have communities closer together which would form stronger community bonds and it would allow us to drastically reduce the amount of pollution we create each year."
6519,0,"The way of seeing how kids feel in a class room, this new technolgy shows it all. Will this change teaching and everything else in the class room, lets find out. Professor, Thomas Huang of Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the Universty of Illinois, working in collaboration with Professor Nicu Sebe of the Universty of Amsterdam. Are construction a computer with a 3-D computer model of the face; it uses all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles, this is called an ""action unit"". I support this idea and here is why I do. This will show very high improvement in class rooms, as this it will show how a kid can learn, if they are happy about this subject and if they are highly entertained, or this could go another way of teaching say we didn't have this type technolgy. A math teacher gives there students a test, the average over all is a 72%, that is not good, a teacher will have to go over the subject again majority due to failing of the subject. Was it the teacher, or was it the students, who will ever know, but if they had the technogly in the room to read their facial expressions, for that the teacher may have post poned the test due to the results of the facial expressions coming back, which could have showed alot of confusion over the section. That could have saved alot of time and get better grades, as they could of not gone back over the section. This would show a lot of improvement in testing scores over all, as teacher would not mine going back over a answer if a student or students or confused what is going. There are 6 different basic emotions in the system, happiness, suprise,anger,digust,fear and sadness. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code. In fact, we humans preform this same impressive ""calculation"" everyday. We can tell when a friend is happy, or upset, due to how much we around them. Its that this 3-D facial computer system can even tell more when you can't. If we had this in a class room, this would help so much, schools could see higher test scores and better improvements. I think it would even better if they took this to even more places. Such as Jails, Conceling areas, Thearpists, as it could show in their true emotions, this could be a lie dector, shows the emotions. Say they can't get anything from someone in a jail, they use that, they could see a fear emotion, or a blank emotion, or sad emotion. I just say this could change the future of alot things in every day life. This could also mean that, school corportaions might recieve rewards for really high scores in testing, which could really help out and some schools, for instance my school, we have don't have some of the newest technolgy as some other schools due, and why because i go to a small school, so we don't recieve high standards as other schools around us do. So that is why i agree we should have this newest technolgy and alot of the schools, to suceed in life and to help kids get better."
3252,0,"Venus In this essay you will be learning about the dangers of pursing Venus. Venus gets extremely hot on its surface, has powerful earthquakes, and Venus could have supported life. Even though these conditions are extreme a machine could survive on the surface for a couple hours. Venus is worthy of studying because it is our ""sister planet"" and at one point in time we believe there was water on Venus. Even though Venus has a hot surface of over ""800 degrees Fahrenheit"" you could study it if you hover above Venus. In the article it states, "" At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that at sea level on Earth."" This demostrates that if NASA were to send people to Venus to study it then they would be fine just hovering over it. Yes the temperature is still really hot but as long as they have air conditioning and the air pressure is close to sea level they should be fine. Secondly Venus has a lot of earthquakes and erupting volcanoes but nothing we can not handle if we hover about it. In the article it states, ""Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface."" This states that yes Venus would be very dangerous to live on and of course we can not live there but that does not mean we can not study it by going above. If we were to send humans there they would need to understand that this is a risk. The author supports these ideas very well because he does not leave any details out and he even says that it is a dangerous mission. Lastly we believe that Venus could have been able to support life on the planet. In the text it states, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" This states that with the large bodies of water Venus could have supported some form of life. The author describes this very well becauase he states that ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" So if we could some how control the temperature and air pressure on Venus who is to say we could not live there. In concluesion Venus has extremely hot surface temperatures, has powerful earthquakes, and could have supported life. The author uses very good details to describe how water and life could have been supported here. He also explains all the earthquakes and lightning strikes. Venus would be very awesome to study because of its Earth like features."
13962,0,"My name is Luke Bomberger and I was apart of the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" program. You could join! Have you ever wanted journey and see the world? Do you like helping people that need help? If you have I think this program may be for you! The Seagoing Cowboys program is a great one I believe. You get to journey the world and help people who really need it. You could all around the world to places like Greece, Europe, China, Mexico,Iran. Most of the time you're there you are helping people who desperately need your assistance and that have been affected by wars or other tragedies in their homeland. After helping, you may even get to see beautiful tourists sites in the places you travel to. You get a chance to help people in need and the satisfaction from it. On top of that, you get to see and visit different unique places! That is why I love this program. Like it states in paragraph of 2, ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"" my first task I carried out was in 1945, World War || was over in Europe, and many countries we're left in ruins. So the UNRAA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that we're being shipped overseas. It also tells you in paragraph 5 of the article that on top of being able to help others I had the wonderful oppurtunity of seeing Europe and China as well as the Acropolis in Greece! I even got to take a gondola ride in Italy and on my way to China I toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal! How great is that! I strongly believe that the Seagoing Cowboys is a great program that gives you oppurtunities to experice adventures and visit many unique places. Getting the satisfaction of knowing you helpled others is a great feeling and enjoying seeing unique and beautiful places is great too. I'm glad I joined this wonderful program and I think you would be happy if you joined to too. Go help and adventure!"
10675,0,"Should cars be driverless or shouldnt be driverless? Driverless cars have a negative and positive effect on the world, some many accident could happen and you wouldnt know whos fault it would be. Either the driver or the manufactorer. Or it could really help out if people need to driver some where and they dont have a car, or there car broke down. I'm against having driverless cars because so many negative things could happen. For example, all the sensor could so out and not work, not even tell the peron in the car. Accidents could happen and wouldnt know who's fault it would be. Driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe. Having driverless arent a way to start. To continue, gas station would be low in business or could go out of business, becasue driverless cars dont take really much gas at all. Sergey Brin says "" the cars he forseeswould use half the fuel of todays taxis and offer far more flexiblity than a bus. What would happen to the bus driver and the taxis driver, they barely even get payed enough and they could lose their job becaise of these cars. There is already problems with cars today that have malfunction have caused death, and having bluetooth in the car so they can listen to music is such a big distraction, teens will always be on the phone to change the song or look who texted them, which could cause a wreck. To conclude my argument, driverless cars arent worth it and take up time and money. Teens get so excited to start driving and becoming like an adult, teens need to feel what an complishment it is to drive, and not driving yourself around thats just being lazy. Driverless cars could effect teens driving. This is why cars need to have a driver at all time and pay attention of what around them driving, them being their own sensor."
8929,0,The Facial Action Coding System can tell how someone is feeling by looking at there face or a painting of them. It showed how Mona Lisa was feeling just by looking ar her picture. Now that is pretty cool if you ask me. I think this technolgy in the classes room would work out so weel for students. Having a coputer that can tell when you are upset or happy or even bored is pretty cool. They talk about how it would sense when someone is bored and the computer would be able to chage whatever its going to someone or interesting for the student. That would help keep students focused on what there doing in a fun and cool way. It would be an amazing idea to have a computer like that. i think this because fit he coputer can know hwen you bred and be able to fix that it would be great. More and more studensts would want to pay attenion. The computer would make it into something cool and insteresting for the student. That if could stop students from losing focus. I mean come on we have all been there when you really dont want to pay attention to somthing that doesnt spark your insterst. Students would guess there way out of the work because it would be do boring for them. They wouldnt try which ends up bad for everyone but mostly students. There are some tihns that could become a probelm though. Like the computers cant hold up all that imfornation on to one small computer. Also schools would have to pay about of money just to give them out to the students. And it would cause about more money to make it the conputers. Some parents may even think there child is being watched and that it might not be safe. There are so man thing that will have to thouhgt of and talked about. That maybe it is best just to keep things the way they are. One last reason why i think it would be a good idea to have these in school is because teachers will beable to understand there students a little more. getting to know how they are feeling about things. When a teahcer finds out there student isnt doing there best they can do a better job and make suree they are doing everthing they can to help. Althought this is a very great technology there are many bumps thy will need to look at. And right now may not be the best time but way down in the futue i hope someone can make it happen. I think it will work really well with students and help them much better. If they do make them out for everyone. I will be first in line to get one!
7708,0,"The use of technology to read students' emotions and expressions would not be valuable in a classroom. As a student living in a generation that is becoming dependent on technology, the ability for computers to read our emotions would not only be a waste of our resources but also a detriment to our education systems. There are many consequences of using technology to read our facial expressions at school. Distractions are prevalent in a classroom and adding the emotional recognition would only be adding a game for students to play with while the lesson was being taught. According to the article if the student was paying attention, their lesson could be modified based on their facial expression. This may confuse the child or present them with material in a way that has never been taught before. They then would have different information from their peers and teacher. Not only would the customized lesson confuse the student, but it would also promote the selfish lifestyle that other technology is by giving the student exactly what they want when they want it. Our students are growing up in a world where technology is providing them with everything they want, and that has made them needy, spoiled, and reliant. If the emotional recognition technology were implemented, then in the future the child may not be able to sit through a job interview or meeting because it would not be modified for their enjoyment. If we were to use technology that reads expressions, we would continue to create people who are not satisfied until everything is catered exactly they way they would like it. The use of technology to read humans' expressions would not be beneficial in a classroom."
17284,0,"Driverless cars, am I for or against the idea of them? I am against the thought of driverless cars for two main reasons. One, drunk drivers and two, kids using the cars. Technology has been becoming more advanced over the years from phones all the way up to cars now. In paragraph four lines one through two says, ""Without the option of smarter roads, manufacturers turned to smarter cars."" Smarter cars are not going to make the world safer because not everyone will be able to afford the new ""smart car"". These new ""smart cars"" will probably be hybrids running on electricity instead of gas. Which will make gas prices for normal cars sky rocket. Now thinking of driving safely that means no drinking, texting, or sometimes even eating. With these driverless cars more than likely people will go out to drink and take there driverless car with them thinking it will still be safe to drive even though they have been drinking. Just because the car drives by its self you still have to hold the wheel. ""special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" paragraph seven line three. Thinking of safety also includes the protection of kids. Teens will think that it's okay to take their parents driverless car because all they will have to do is hold the wheel which is wrong because in paragraph seven lines six through eight reads ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" In conclusion the driverless car would not be safe for this generation."

18131,0,"Wouldn't you like to take a break from having to drive all time? Well maybe now you can because the driverless car period is in the near future. Though the car wouldn't be completely driverless, it'd still give you a small break from having to do all the driving. Safety is alway the number one priority, and a smart car will deliver that. There are plenty of benefits in the making of a smart car. Think about all the sensors that would need to go into a smart car. Doesn't that make you feel safer just thinking about having sensors that detect and tell you when you're in danger? So far, a smart car can only steer, accelerate, and brake themselves. Also, they're all designed to notify the driver when there is a work zone or anaccident ahead so the driver can know to take control. GM has seats that vibrate when the car is in danger of being backed into an object. There are other options of danger warnings being considered as well. Such as, flashing lights on a windshield and other heads up displays. Yes, a smart car is not yet completely driverless. Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan have plans to have cars drive on their own by 2020. Smart cars would fundamentally change the world. According to the article, Google cofounder Sergey Brin ""envisions a future with a public transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public-transport taxi system"" that would use half the gas of today's taxis and also offer way more flexibilty than a bus. Of course we run into the agument of why would anyone buy a driverless car that would still partially require a driver. And the question of: wouldn't it get boring waiting until they need to drive? Sure, but think about not having to drive 100% of the time in a fun, new way. Some manufacturers are even hoping to have in-car entertainment and information systems. Those systems would use heads-up displays that could be instantly turned off when the driver needs to take control. In conclusion, think about all the benefits of a smart car. At the same time though, think about the downfalls. A smart car would be safe and fun for you and your family. Some would argue otherwise, that a smart car is just as dangerous and it'd get boring. Finally, these cars are our future because there are car manufacturers that already have plans in motion."
5480,0,"The use of this technology to read students emotional expressions is not valuable. The software may be incorrect on how a studnet is feeling or it may be a intrution of personal space/information. The software may stop emotional communication for sure and or communication period. The software may not always be accuate and be wrong on some parts. As the text states in paragraph 1. ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."". The way it gives percentages on how someone is feeling doesnt always mean thats what they're really feeling. Also when a software can recognize how a student is feeling it's sometimes a matter of invading personal information and/or thoughts. As the texts states in paragraph 5,"" For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" connecting to ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"", in paragraph 6. If a student is having issues such as feeling sad or mad about something they should be able to come to a teacher or adult themselves rather than a computer pointing it out. The same technology may be a threat for people to actually connect on a emotional level and nonverbal at all. In paragraph 6, it states, ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive-for video games or video surgery."" connecting to ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"". The creators of the software inlcuded some good examples on why we would need this. In paragraph 1 it states, ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on their face. Of course most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."". It is true some of us would have trouble reading someone if they were depressed or unhappy. It would be good to have that reassurance to make sure they are okay and prevent something from happening to them. The software would help students in the classroom when they are having trouble undertsading something and the teaher is not around. As in paragraph 6 states, ""A classroom computer could recogize when a student is becoming confused or bored.. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Overall I feel the software is not a very good idea, due to lack of communication and accuracy. Although it has some good values in it, it wouldnt be a good way for humans to tell their emotions and communication through one another."
7788,0,"Personally, I can see why society would look against this. I like the idea of bringing this technology into a classroom because it can help a teacher find out when a student is confused while doing activites during school hours. I think this software should only be used for school purposes though. Sometimes teenagers or in this case students, hide their feelings or emotions on purpose. So, this software can make a student really uncomfortable. So back to what I was saying, I think this type of software is helpful in some cases not all. I think the idea of a computer recognizing what our emotion is really cool and a very interesting topic. The fact that such technology can recognize our emotions and go into detail specifically is a well thought of idea. Personally I wouldn't really like the fact that a teacher would be able to tell what my emotion is real or not real. I just think that goes a little over the privacy stage. This type of software could be really expensive in my guess. It would probably cost a fortune! Dr. Huang talks about how this type of software could modify a lesson by a computer telling if we are confused or bored. I can see why Dr. Huang would think that this software could be benefical but I don't think such material should be presented to the students. What if that specific student is going through a hard time and doesn't want others to know? I feel like this argument could go either way and it should.This idea that is presented by Dr. Huang is a really good idea, but personally I just think it's too much."
12665,0,"Driverless cars have both positive and negative things about them. They are supposively supposed to drive on their own, without needing any human assistance in the future. At the moment there are some cars that can drive at certain speeds or do certain things on their own, but still need a human to be there when the assistance is needed. An example of a car was made in 2013 by BMW, called the ""Traffic Jam Assistant"". The car can handle driving on its own for up to 25 mph,and can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, and let the driver know when the road ahead needs their assistance. I think that driverless cars would be really cool if they were actually 100% driverless and 100% safe and reliable. There are laws against driving these cars in most states right now, just because they want to make sure that everyone on the road including the driver in the ""driverless"" car is safe. They could do a lot of good though like allow people to stop driving after a long car ride for a while, like if they were driving to somewhere very far like vacation, or just had a long day. Also would be good if they were really tired while in the car, they could also eat food if they wanted while in the car. If they had kids or animals they could also pay attention to them more instead of having to just focus on the road ahead of them and other cars, stop lights, and signs, etc. Those are just some positive things about the driverless cars. There are also negaitive things too, like if they weren't 100% safe, they could be very dangerous to the people in the cars and to other people in different cars. If they weren't all the way safe and reliable, they could get into a lot of crashes or kill or harm people, they could malfunction or stop doing what they're supposed to do. If that were to happen things could just be bad altogether. In my opinion the only way these driverless cars would be cool and work was if they would be all the way reliable and not need assistance. If that was true then driverless cars would be a great asset to the world and could do a lot of good and just overall be helpful to others. I think that if they continue to work and upgrade the driverless cars they're trying to make in the future it could be possible that we have these cars without needing any help from the driver, unlike now which needs some human assistance and is not all the way safe and reliable to be on the roads and driving."
9546,0,"A face on Mars...more like a mesa on Mars. The ""Face on Mars"" is definatly not an alien monument. It has been proven to be a Martian mesa. There are many reasons why you may have mistaken the mesa for a face. This essay will prove that the ""Face on Mars"" is just a mesa on Mars. The idea of aliens on Mars is quite exciting but it's not true. On Mars there are many other mesas around Cydonia which is a region on the Red Planet. The only difference is that this mesa has unusual shadows. These shadows give the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. On April 5, 1998 when the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took a picture that was ten times more sharper than the original Viking photos. That picture instead of revealing a Martian civilization it instead revealed a mesa with indentations and outcroppings of land. Then again on a cloudless summer day in Cydonia, April 8, 2001, they took another photo. This time the photo used ""the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" And again all it revealed was a simple mesa with little lumps and marks. It didn't even resemble a face at all. These photos proved that there are no aliens, just alot of oddly shaped mesas. The ""Face on Mars"" has been debunked. Instead of an alien monument it is just a simple Martian mesa. There are no credible sources or people that agree with the alien monument theory. All of NASA and the science field agree that it's just a simple mesa, so why shouldn't you and me?"
14980,0,"In my personal opinion, I think that driverless cars could be a good idea, but only when any problems with the technology behind the driverless aspect are fixed and the cars don't still somewhat rely on the person in the car to take over in certain situations. Driverless cars can be helpful in many situations, but we need to be sure that they are as safe as (if not safer than) the cars we use today and have been using for decades in the past. There are many situations in which driverless cars would be a good thing to have. In paragraph 5, it states that ""Within 10 years, those sensors had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers."" Here, we are provided with an example of how these cars can already help prevent accidents even if they aren't completely driverless. Though these cars are still somewhat dependent on the person or people inside, the manufacturers have made advancements in technology that make somewhat driverless cars safe to a certain extent. Next, if we bring our attention to paragraph 8, we begin to learn about certain displays that can alert the person or people in the car when they need to take over. The author helps explain this by saying ""Some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over - something not available to drivers trying to text with a cellphone."" As the reader can see from this paragraph, advancements have been made to alert drivers who may not be paying attention, so that since these cars aren't completely driverless yet, the driver can still avoid accidents by being alerted when there is a potentially dangerous situation at hand. So while these cars are not completely driverless, I think that if the manufacturers fix any problems with the technology and make them completely driverless to avoid any problems on the driver's or passengers' part, they could be a really good thing to have, not to mention they could be really good for making more money for the car companies. These cars already have sensors that can help prevent skids and rollovers, and manufacturers are developing systems to alert distracted drivers when they need to take control of the car. While there are still some problems with the technology and the fact that the cars aren't yet 100% driverless, I think that driverless cars are a step in the right direction when it comes to transportation."

But here is why you are wrong,""A small strip of metal along the edge stopped his slide, keeping him from flying overboard into the dark Atlantic."" The small things can keep your kids from doing something that is bad or you can do it yourself. That is why your kids should do the Seagoing Cowboys program it is the right thing to do with your kids or yourself. Have fun at the progarm."
8447,0,"In the article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile, "" I think that the use of this technology is possible to give us an answer to the questions we've always asked about. This piece of technology is very useful and can show varying degrees of expression, it dectects how you feel just by your facial muscles. The computer can only classify six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness; and all associated with movements of facial muscles. We humans perform the same impressive calculations everyday, when we see our friends we know if something is wrong just by the look on their faces. In conclusion, this technology would be valuable in a classroom to detect students emotions because some of us are not capable to understand facial expressions and instead of asking if they're okay and making them more upset, all you have to do is use this technology and tell if something is wrong."
11851,0,"The face on mars is a landformation. People would argue it isnt but keep in mind that isnt the case with this. With people argueing that it isnt they think aliens did it but that may not have happend. The face of Mars has to be a landformation. The face on mars is a landformation because natural occurances happen. This could have happend fromm a meteor strike or the winds in Mars. Not to mention if the clouds in mars are constant then finding this twice on over a 20 year period should still be the same fro slow winds and mild weater. Many people belive aliens were the cause of the face. Well thats nearly impossible if you consider the aliens were made in mars. Life forms take upon millions of years to grow and need about 60 degree weather on average and mars has below freezing average. Plus if theree were life on Mars, there should be green on Mars because of plants. People also think its aliens because of the lattitude changed. Well this is because the camera that had to take this picture had to be on a cloudy storm probaly causeing some small problems but nothing minor. At the end I think the face is a landformation and that life could not of done this. It solid evidence. I mean stuff on earth happens like that all the time and people dont care, it is like how you see a bunny on the moon but in reality they are just cooled down oceans of lava. So the face on Mars in my opinion is a landformation."
8013,0,"Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. This is valuable because a computer program could know how you are feeling, adjust your viewing program to make you happier with the program, and make you happier. A computer program could know how you are feeling based on your facial expression. In the passage it states that, ""It's all about those muscular action units. They can even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one."" This shows that a computer program can tell how you are feeling even when you may try to hide it or force a smile. The Facial Action Coding System could also adjust your program to make you happier with your program. For example, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,""Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This shows that FACS is able to make the lesson into something you can enjoy. This can Improve grades and overall attitudes in classrooms. The program can make you happier overall and allow you to succeed in school. It states in the passage, ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions but also may even help produce them."" This shows that smiling can help you become happier. The program is made to allow you to feel certain emotions and adjusts the program based on your feelings. For example, if you are getting bored with the work that the program is providing it can alter the work to what you can feel more comfortable with. FACS is valuable because a computer program can know how you feel, adjust your program to meet your needs, and make you happier. If we had this program this would allow more students to feel better about our learning, leading us to learn more. Also allow us to enjoy viewing ads, movies, TV, etc."

The author also states highs and lows of studying venus. In the text it states ""Often referred to as Earth's ""twin,"". "" This explains that the author is trying to make people think that venus is just like Earth. He wants to make people think that Venus is just like Earth because he knows if people like Earth they will like Venus as well.

8097,0,"Technology has greatly advanced throughout the years. It goes from the first light bulb, to the first phone, to cars, and now to todays technology, such as smart phones or self lacing shoes. Now there is even a more advance form of technology, and that is a computer software cabable of scanning faces to help determine/understand the emotions of another human. Profesor Thomas Huang, of Beckman institute imagined being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, thus he invinted his new computer software to help him do so. With this new software he claimed it would help students understand each other better, not only that but it would help teachers understand the students better as well. Which I believe would valuable and would greatly impact schools in a good manner. First of all this is how Huang's technogogy works. The computer is to construct a 3-D type model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the said model will need to move just like a humans.Then with its six basic emotions, happines, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness, it will associat each of the emotions to the characteristic movements of the facial muscles. The article gives the example of how your frontalis pars lateralis muscles raise you raide your eyebrows when you are supprised. Also the human orbicularis oris tightens a persons lips to show they are angry. The emotions we show and how we show them are universal, even if we all show them slightly different. Now with this new found software/technology students would be able to benifit from this. As a kid sometimes you dont show/share your emotions well with others, espically if youre a teen. Sometimes it is hard for people in genreral to open up to others, because we don't want them to worry. But with is extraordinary invention kids/students would be able to help themselves and each other with their emotions. Here is an example, if a kids parents are getting divorced, this will greatly impact that kid. It might make him mad, sad, stressed, all other sorts of things. One day if the kids friend asks him how is he doing and the kid just says fine, that is the end of that conversation and the kid wouldn't have gotten the support of his friend. Now if the emotion scanning was used on the kid then maybe his friend would be able to see that the kid isn't alright and needs to talk to someone. This could help so many kids with issues like this. Farthermore this wouldn't only be helping kids but this would be helping teachers as well. It could help a teacher understand what his students are thinking, such as if they understand the subject or not. With this technology in use a teacher would know if a student is becoming confused or maybe even bored for that matter. Thus allowing the teacher to modify the lesson he or she is giving, and in doing so he or she is becoming more effective instructor. With the emotion scanner in a classroom it would become a better envirement for students due to the fact the teacher can now tell who is confused and may need extra help with the lesson. The new technology that is able to read and understand emotional expressions would be very valuable to a classroom/school envirement. Not only would it allow students to help each other by now being able to share and understand their/ their friends emotions, but it also now allows teachers to help students if they do not understand what is being taught. This new software seems to have the capablity to make school a better place for all the people in it, adults and kids alike. Technology right now has the capability to make schools better for sutdents and teachers, that can only mean there is a strong possiblity of even more technology to come in the future thus increasing better school envirements even farther."
11158,0,"""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" Unmasking the Face on Mars tells us about the face that was on Mars. Everyone think it is created by aliens.I think it is just a natural landform. I say this because in the story ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" in paragrapgh 1 it said ""When it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia"". I feel like they just spotted the photo in just took a picture of it. Other people think it is alien movement going on up in Mars.Ithink that because in paragraph 6 it said "" ALthough few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact photograpghing Cydoina bacame a priority for NASA when Mars Global Survyer (MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in Sept. 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended."" They are saying some of the scientists do feel like it was an alien movement. I think some of the scientists are trying to tell other peopleit is a alien movement to. In paragraph 5 it said "" The "" Face on Mars"" has since become a pop icon. It has started in hollywood flim, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years! Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspireacy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an civilization on Mars. I think it is a landform because they just took pictures of it. They didnt see any type of movement. In when people are sent to out of space they would have seen aliens, but they didnt. Now people are trying to bring up all the aliens things. If we had aliens we would have known by now. So, I don't see why people are trying to say we have aliens on Mars. If there were aliens they would be in a label testing right about now. People would know. Everyone tell and say things on Facebook so it would have been going around by now. We don't have aliens. I say its just a natural landmark. They just took pictures of it. In paragraph 7 it said "" And on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydoin for the first time, Michael and his Mar Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times shaper than the oringal picture Viking photos. Thousand of anxious web surfers web site were wating when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was an alien monument after all."" So, they are basically saying there wasn't a alien after all. Also in paragraph 9 it said "" In fact its hard work."" "" Mars global Surveyor is a mapping spacecraft that normally looks striaght down and scan the planet like a fax machine in narrow 2.5 km-wide strips."" ""We just don't pass over the FAce very often,"" he noted. H is basically saying they don't go over the face very often.They went over it to prove to people it wasn't a alien movement."
8225,0,"Everyone has some sort of technology whether it be a televison, phone, or gaming console. Some have absolutely no type of technology and can do without. Others work with technology to make useless things. Useless? yes! useless just like the latest innovation from Professor. Thomas Huangs created to reconize peoples mood. To begin, who needs a computer to tell someone your mood? exactly!! nobody. Give the students some privacy in the class room, especially if they like their privacy. What value does this application have? you can scan someones face in hopes of getting the correct answer. Furthermore, I dont know about you, but we are all human and I can tell when my friend is upset or happy. It's natural, we have eyes and can see so why trust a computer that is can only reconize six moods! In the prompt it states ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions"". That's just silly, if im paying for something it would have to tell me exactly how im feeling and be 100% accurate. Also, Dr. Huangs reasoning behind this is nonsense. In paragraph 6, it states "" A classroom computer could reconize whether a student is confused or bored"" Dr. Huang goes on and says ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" There are many things wrong with, one being that the stundent(s) can just make confused/bored faces until it modifies the program to be really easy or super fun. In conclusion, this program is useless because it wouldn't be very accurate, you can see how someone is feeling with your own eyes, and it could cause students to manipulate the program and teacher causing school work to become easier and more on the fun side rather than boring and confusing to the students and their classmates."
1581,0,"In the article ' The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author says that studing venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it holds. The author states in paragraph 2, "" no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" With him saying this it makes me believe that there is no way to study the planet Venus if nothing can with stand its heat. If nothing can with stand the heat, nothing can go down below and try to retrieve the data. The author did not support his idea well enough. In paragraph 3 the author states that almost 97 percent of Venus is carbon dioxide, but even more challenging, the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. With those conditions not even a human could with stand the pressure of the gases and may not even survive. Eventhough the scientists are considering the probability of sending humans 30 miles above the ground on a blimp - like vehicle, they neither have the blimp or enough data to even know if they could be 30 miles above it. The author has no evidence to support that the blimp could with stand the heat or the pressure from the gases. Nor do they have the data about being able to send a human there safetly and being able to get them home. In conclusion the author did not support his idea well enough. There was not enough information in the text to support that this could happen. It was just an idea he had without any of the information needed to support it. Therefore, the authors claim did not support any of the information given in the article. If the author had given data saying how it could be possible and ways to make it possible with factual data then this his idea would have been supported. But the information he gave did not inform or support enough."

15242,0,"Moon faces. Have you ever seen faces on the Moon? Three examples im going to use is that there is no evidence left behind also, aliens dont know how people look, second NASA is a highly qualified place that does lots of research, third aliens dont exist. These faces are not made by aliens because, there was no evidence left behind. For Example, there would have been footprints or hand marks left behind. According to the story NASA didn't see any evidence. Second, how do aliens know what people look like or other species. According to life aliens dont have t.v's or pictures of things. Last, there was no evidence of tools left behind and, what tools are there that aliens can use. According to the story they found no tools anywhere. In conclusion, It would be hard for an alien to make faces like that without having human knowledge. Second, NASA is a highly qualified research group. First, NASA looks at the faces more than one. This example shows that NASA couldn't have really missed important evidence. Next, they also do their experiments over and over agaun and they also have multiple people do it to see if they get the right answer. Ths exampe shows if six different people observed the same thing more than once its had to be possibly correct. Lastly, NASA has lots of advanced technology to help them with their job. Thia examle shows without that advanced technology they wouldn't be able to observe lots of things correctly. In conclusion, NASA is highly qualified group of scientist who carefully do their job correctly. Last, aliens do not exist. For example is aliens exist when NASA go to space im pretty sure they would have eventually seen an alien. This shows that aliens are not on Mars. Next, NASA has not found one piece of evidence that aleins have been on Mars. This shows that footprints would have been left on the surface of Mars. Last, NASA would have been found alien UFO's or pieces of their UFO's when they get damaged. That example shows no evidence was found relating to aliens. In conclusion, not alien evidence was left behind or aliens were not seen. Aliens could have sculpt these faces. But, they did not because we have no evidence. Aliens could be real. But, we havent see evidence or have seen one wit our eyes so, until then aliens do not exist."

Google has made a driverless car that has senors on the wheels of the car and on the roof of the car. Even though senors have been around since the 1980's and have advanced since then, the senors that are on the brakes of the car can reduce the power in your engine.the senors reduce the engine because it takes a lot of power on your car. you need the power you can get from your engine just in case you're in a bad sitution. Not only driveless cars need lots of senors they arent able to help through nagativing through road work and heavy traffic. Driveless cars arent really driverless when you think about it. Driverless cars need the assitanants of humans to pull out of a driveway. They also need help with heavy traffic issues.

In some states driverless cars are already considered illegal for that reason. Who would be responsible if theres a crash, the driver or the manufacture? Its better to limit the use of driverless cars because cars who be more safe in the control of a human driver. Its better not to have driverless cars.

The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars. Although few scientists believed the face was an alien artifact, photography others think its just a natural landform because there is no evidence that it was a alien. The team eve snapped a photo not once but ten times sharper than the original viking photots to make sure it was no ailen and that it would just come out as a natural landform. So perhaps thousands of anxious nervous we surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site. After all ther was no alien as they see on the pictures they took. But nobody was satisfied. They had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center to center the face in the field of view Mailins team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's because people still dont believe that it is not an alien face. So after the results it was actually a natural landform, landfroms comman around the American west. As you know you always have to have another plan to figure out if the situation is true or not. Always try another camera or a better camera to know rather its a alien or landform to know the real exact answer. Even if you trying to find evidence if its true or false and have otthers on your team or with you to figure it out."
21414,0,"Dear Florida State Senator, I do not believe that we should keep the Electoral College. I think that we should vote for presidents and have them win by popular vote. My reasons for aboloshing the Electoral college is that the president should win by popular vote of the citizens of the U.S., we shouldn't let electors be the reason the president wins, and we should have a direct voting system than the Electoral College system. First, the president should win by popular votes from the citizens, not electors of the candidates. The people would vote directly so the president would win by popularity of people in the states. The presidential candidate has electors. So when one person votes it counts as the electors votes not theirs. I don't think that is fair. Second, we should not let the electors be the reason our president wins. It states in the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" that the ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their own candidate. They decided to vote for whoever they please. Isn't their job supposed to be to vote for their parties candidate. How can we trust them? Thirdly, I believe that we should have direct voting instead of the Electoral College. The reason why is because we can easily vote ourselves and actually realize that the president we chose was actually us, not the electors. It is nice to know that we made that decision and not remember that it was just the electors getting their votes from ours. It states in the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" that ove sixty percent of voters would prefer a direct election because some states know that the actual voting and winning comes from the states electors. The people would not even pay attention to the campaigns because they don't care anymore. In conclusion, people would rather have direct voting than the Electoral College. Direct voting is easy and it makes us feel like we actually care. The Electoral College however, doesn't really pay attention to the campaigns either because they are basing their votes from ours. The Electoral College is unfair in many ways. I would rather have direct voting than the Electoral College. Sixty percent of the U.S. would agree with me."

They are not a gaurentee of saftey for the passengers nor pedestrians, and they are not completely driverless! These cars still require human assistance. If one of these smart cars were to have an issue and cause an accident the blame will be put on the owner of vehical, not the manufacturer. These cars have alot more things that need to be added and fixed before they are aloud on the road, in my opinion. In the reading it states that ""drivers will need to keep both hands on the wheel as a safety feature""-- that could be aggrivating if you aren't getting to drive. I do not think that driverless cars are a good decision to have on the road. I also do not believe they are more effciant or safe. These cars are just another way for us to be lazy. The car still requires full attention as if you are driving-- so why not just drive?"
23731,0,"In Source 1 Elizabeth Rosenthal gives information on Germany's car-free cities and shows her support of the idea. I belive that a car-free day as shown in Source 2 in Paris is a good idea for two reasons. First, a single day of no use of automobiles can be extremely beneficial to the ecosystem. Second, it is shown tobe less stressful and safer to those who participate in the event. The benefits of a car-free day far outweigh the slight inconvenience that it may bring. In the event in paris they had a 60 percent decrease in traffic congestion and before the car-free day paris had 147 micrograms of pollution in the air and after the car-free day it had a measley 79.9 microgram count, thats impressive. not to mention this is only a 24-hour event everyone can sacrifice that ammount of time for a great cause like this. Secondly, there are several records of people claiming that they feel less stressed like citizen of Vauban, Germany, like Hiedrun Walter. No automobiles means no traffic, no loud horns or loud engines in the middle of the street. Plus, you will be able to enjoy exercise and taking a train or Taxi to you're destination which allows for a more public and social experience for those who participate, and not to mention you could be fined if you dont participate. In conclusion, I feel that it is highly beneficial to the ecosystem to limmit car usage even if only for a day. It's a slight sacrifice for a potentialy huge gain. It can also prove to cause less stress than every day transportation that were used to."
22569,0,"Dear State Senator, I personally think that we should not have the Electoral College, because the citizens should be allowe to pick our president and vice prsident. It should be up to the people not the congress. According to paragraph three of source one, the Electoral College consist of five hundred and thirty-eight electors. A canidate has to earn two hundred and seventy of those votes. To me that is not right. Why spend time bringing these people in to vote when you have a whole state full of people who wants to have a voice in the matter. Also the congress does not know what the people want. So if you pick a canidate and he is not what the people what he may be planning to blow up the world. The citizens of the United States know what they wan in a leader and they know what they look forward to in the future. By letting congress select our president your not letting us speak for our self and that is wrong.According to paragraph fifteen of source three,Electoral College is widely regarded as an Anachronism and needs to bee overruled which i strongly agree with. Also in paragraph sixteen of source three, it states that citizens choose their representative and they trust them to pick the right person but that trust is often betrayed, So why would you keep having this election? Soon enough people are going to stop caring. According to paragraph eleven of source two, The electoral college is a waist of time and it is not needed because people are starting not to care and are not even choosing their own canidate. They are not liking who their state chose and they dont care because state legistlatures are responsible for picking electors anyway. Some states choose two slates and send them to congress,Like Hawaii did in 1960,Things like this is why we dont need electoral colleges. What if it happens again? or What if there is a tie? In an electoral college every state could only cast one vote. So they have one represntative for lets say five hundred thousand voters.That doesnt make any sence at all. How come everyone doesnt vote for who thy want by themselves? Maybe someone whats a president frome another state instead of their own.According to paragraph fourteen, It states that the electoral college is unfair, outdated and irrational and i agree one hundred percent. As Bob Dole Says Abolish the Electoral College. In closing i hope you will view in my favor and in everyone elses who says this type of system is old, unfair and it needs to be ruled out. I thank you for reading my letter and i hope you enjoyed hearing about what i think. It was a pleasure writing to you and i really hope you take my opinion into consideration. Thank you again and have a wonderful day. Sincerly, PROPER_NAME"
6634,0,"Any language is not completely verbal. The truth is that language is mostly non verbal communication in all species of animals. Dr. Paul Eckman spent his whole life studying emotions. He is widely respected in the field of psychology, and even went to Africa to study if emotions really were universal. He learned that humans all had a universal language in emotions and programmed what he knew into the ""Facial Action Coding System"". This marvelous system allows computers to identify human emotions. Having a machine read human emotions is the most valuable tool you could have in a classroom, becuase you can tailor education to each individual student, further prepare students for the material they will be tested on, and ultimately choose a fiulfilling career in a field of study they enjoy. This technology has the capability to recognize percentages of emotions. You would now be able to tell if students are 80% happy about being lectured, or 87% happy about reading from a textbook. It is also now possible for teachers to tell how well a student is understanding the material. If a student's face appears flustered, or frustrated to the computer it can alert the teacher and they can give some much needed help. The FACS can recognize when a student is frustrated, and needs help with a problem even if they aren't raising their hand to say so. By giving this reading it will allow overall grades to be higher. It will also allow teachers to observe how happy a student gets when finally understanding a topic. This technology will allow tailoring education to each individual student so they can learn and gain the most they can out of school. In schools that have FACS you could also tell how a emotionally prepared a student is for class. Most studentds are able to act as if they are having a really good day when they are upset on the inside. With this machine it would be able to read their facial expression and let the teacher or an administrator know that a student was having a rough day and needs special attention or some time in the hallway. Teachers would also know if the well hidden feeling of sadness or any mix of emotions was from a student who was rather unprepared for a test. The pupil could now not fail, but have the teacher review the material for them the day before so they will feel more prepared, and perform better. Finally this technology compares emotional faces to neutral faces. It can recognize what subjects a student takes pleasure in, and more precisely what subtopics a student enjoys allowing them to find a fulfilling career. Students may be taking an APUSH course and have a heighened enjoyment for the civil war. The machine will detect the smile on their face during this time and you will be able to see that this student should have a job in the field of history. A student could also take a few percents more pleasure in buisness than in another subject, and open themselves up to the world of buisness which is something they never thought they would do. If you are able to read human emotions in a classroom the learning experience will be substantially more effective. By understanding exactly how students feel you can prepare them better for exams, find them careers they will love, and help them understand all the material more clearly."

They are way to dangerous for the comunity for any where to be exact. why would you want driverless car any ways they are dangerous. Thats why im against the driverless cars because they are dangerous,unsafe,you dont know if they are reliable. What if one of the google cars the part doesnt work like such as the vibrating seats when the car is backing up what if it didnt work and you backed in to something? what is when the person needs to take over the vehicle what if the person doesnt hear it say it? Well in paragraph 9 it states that "" even if traffic laws change, new lawd woll be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident."" yeah say a technology fails and runs off the road into a house on that road and there are people in their. in sentence 12 says ""Whos fault whould it be the driver or the manufacturer?"" Also in paragraph 7 it states that "" human drivers stil have to be alert and be ready to take overwhen the situation requires."" say the sensors aren't working and you cant get you car under control, and kids are playing in their yard not the road their yard and the sensors aren't working and you struck one of the kids its going to be put on you. Now do you see that these cars are dangerous and we shouldnt have the driverless cars? They should build other things then a driverless car. Google can build other products that people wil buy the helpful object."
1569,0,"In "" The Challenges of Exsploring Venus"" how the author suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents is by comparing venus to earth by saying "" Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth. What i think the author is trying to say is that Venus is very much like earth."" even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's athmosphere."" Why i think this is a detail that supports the claim is becouse in paragraph 3 the author list all of the negitives about Venus of how the temeture is exstreamly hot and how thick the atmosphere is and how the the clouds are filled with highly corrosive acid. despite all of these things about Venus it is still interesting exslpore and to learn about. In conclusion our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but shoud be exspaned to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."
20808,0,"Having a car can get you places much faster than walking or riding a bike. But there's a price you pay either on gas or the co2 emisions coming from the muffler. It is extreamly bad for the planet and we need to take action. Reducing car usage will releive you and you wont be as stressed. In some countries they have a car-free day where millions of people ride the bus, hike or walk. Thats in BOGOTA, Columbia it is smart of them but its going to take a lot more to make a change for the best. (source 3:Car-free day in spinning into a big hit in Bogota) Conjested cities are known to have smog and that is nothing but air polution. And all of that polution isnt going anywhere. it stacks up causing a greenhouse effect and harming the air we breathe. But theres always going to be people driving cars unsless stricked rules are made up. we need to enforce that we only have one earth and everytime someone steps inside a car we are harming it. There are other means for transportation and we need to stop being lazy and carpool or take a taxi or bus and limit the emitions or else we are bound to doom ourselves in a co2 filled planet. (Source 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars) But banning car driving can harm the economy greatly causing the unemployment rate to skyrocket because the car companies couldnt sell anything. And transportation keeps everything running throughout America and the world. So the greatest idea would be to create a car that doesnt burn up emitions and sends them out into the atomosphere. We couldnt just get rid or all cars because our world is dependent on them. but we should use them smarter and drive durng sertain times. so all in all we should just keep on driving and do the best we can to stop all the air polution and try to make the world better for future genorations. and we just need to get smarter"
15826,0,"My position on driverless cars is that they are bad. Driverless cars are machines. Like any type of machine it can malfuncton. If machiens in a factory malfunction it just sets them back for a couple of days but if a driverless car was to malfunction then it could take lives, hurt people, and pretty much destroy anything in it's path. Like it syas in paragraph 8 we don't have completely driverless cars the cars still have areas they need people to drive for them. If we can come up with the technology to fix this problem then we would still have the issue of the car malfunctioning. Some people might say that we still have human error in the world and the wouldn't be any different from a malfunction of a driverless car but I think it would. There is a thing before and after a wreck called defensive driving a computer wouldn't have that people would be able to steer away from the wreck but the computer wouldn't have the fast insticts that a person would have. It is also not legal to even test a self driving car in some states so if we are going to change from driving our selves to having a machine do it then we would have to make it legal in the whole country because if the only car you have is a sel friving car and you try to take a vacation with it then you would end up getting a ticket or even worse arrested. I also think that we can spend tax payers dollars to better use then just trying to build a sef driving car we could or on a cure for some diseases. That is my view on us trying to get drive free cars. People may be wreckless at times on the road but things would get way worse if it was just up to machiens to drive for us."
4474,0,"In "" The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author makes Venus seem cool to explore. But he also makes it extremley clear how it's so dangerous to go to the planet. He states that not one single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proxiity to us. Some details that the author gave us on why Venus is dangerous are; Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting stirkes to probes seeking to land on its surface. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. A thick atmospher of almsot 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of higly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface the temeperatures are over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. Now Venus is a worthy pursuit because Venus may have been the most Earth-like planet in our solor system. Long ago Venus was coverd by oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth today. The planet still has some features that are similiar to those on Earth. Venus has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and creaters. As written above I have stated all the facts that the auhtor gave us on why Venus is so dangerous to explore. I've also stated the facts on why the astronomers are fascinated by Venus and why they want to do more reserch on the planet. Venus can sometmes be our nearest option for a plaentry visit."
11311,0,"The so called "" Face'' on mars is just a landform that looks like a face. I know this because there are no such thing as aliens, if aliens did exist we would have seen them and known by now, and lastly I know that I is just a landform because it looks like a coincidental landform that looks like an alien. The first reason that I know it is a landform and not an alien is because aliens do not exist. They are some made up characters found in science fiction books and movies, just like monsters, witches, and ghosts. There has never been actual scientific evidence that proved any of those things to be real. Many crazy people think that they have encountered ghost sightings and other things like demons, zombies, or even something as dumb as slenderman. These things are all fantasies that they make up in their heads and then try to get other foolish people to believe them. The second reason that I know that it is not an alien is that if aliens and monsters really did exist we would have all known by know. If they were anything like what they are in movies we would all be dead or abducted. In movies people see UFO's and they suddenly are sucked up into a portal and abducted by aliens and used as slaves. If they existed you would think that many people would probably have gone missing after ""UFO"" sightings. Like I said before it is just a bunch of nonsence that people have made up in their head and aren't smart enough to know that it isn't true. My last reason that I know it isn't an alien is because I know that landforms can often look like things that they really aren't. For example at my uncles house they have a big rock in their back yard that looks a lot like a ground hog. I know that it is not a ground hog, but if I was like the people that thought it was an alien I could make up a bizare story about how in ancient times the ground hog got cursed and then was turned into a rock because the king demanded it to. See? It just doesn't make much sence. Sure, the landform looks somewhat like a face in the 1976 picture, but so did the rock in my uncle's back yard. All the thoughts of it being an alien is so made up in their heads. The NASA crew said, ""Nasa's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous heaad nearly two miles for end to end seemed to be staring at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. First off, the aliens in sci-fi movies aren't nearly two miles long, not even close to that. Secondly where it says that the head seemed to be staring up at them, obviously if you are above it and it's a 2d or 3d shape it's going to appear to be looking at you! In conclusion there is no way that the so called face on mars is an alien. It's not an alien because aliens don't exist, we would have known by now it aliens really existed, and some landforms are shaped like odd things. Like I said earlier, if aliens really existed we would have encountered them before and seen UFO's that would try to abduct us. This is why there are no such things as aliens, which means the face on mars is just a landform that just so happens to look like a face."
14549,0,"Is this ""face"" an alien artifact. No. It is just a mesa or large hill that looks like a face. When nasa first discoverd it in 1976 it must have shocked groun control to see such a figure. However the first time somone ""other than nasa workers"" saw it they hald to think of the posibility that it could be the remains or a statue of a life form. Threw time picture resolution got beter and beter and the face would look more and more real every time. However it was still jus a mesa, some would want you to think it was real so you would buy a product or suport a cause to explore it more. The last picture taken of it in 2001 would show that it was just a hill. It is explain in pararph 10 scentences 2 through 4. In paragraph 12 it states "" what the picture actualy shows it the martian equivilant of a butte or mesa-lanforms comon in the American west."" More facts that can prove that the face is just a hill can be found in paragraph 11 "" ""As a rule of thumb, you can dicen things in a digital imiage 3 times biger than the pixel size,"". More info is found in scentence 2 of paragraph 11 "" So if there were objects lin the picture like airplanes on the groundor Egyptian- stile pyramids or even small shaks, you could see what they are. However ther are no objects near or around the face. The last bit of information that I have at my disposal canbe found in paragraph 9 scentence 2 ""Mars global surveyor is a mappin spacecraft that normaly looks strieght down and scans the planate like a fax machinne in narow 2.5 km- wide stips. Even with such detailed skaning the MGS found nothing on the entire planet the showed and sighns of an anchent life for or any present life forms there today. Even after all of the space craft we have sent to mars none of them show any sighns of life or past life. So in conclusion there is no evidence suporting the fact that ther is or has ever ben any life on mar to have made the face. However ther will still be people the try to say the face was made by someone or somthing."
20465,0,"Driverless cars are not a good idea. I think that it will not end good. The human race is making computers do everything for them today. What if the computer in the car glitches? What if the computer just stops working? I do not see how it is so hard for a person to drive their car and not have a computer do it for them. Development in technology is a good thing, but we need to make sure that we are using it for the right things. As a person that has their license I do not see how it is so hard to sit in a seat ans steer a wheele and press a pedal. Humans are getting very lazy in my opinion. I think we have more things to worry about than having a computer drive your car. If computers do everything like drive a bus or a taxi that is going to put millions of people out of work. People drive for a living and if we have taxis or busses that can drive themselves where does that leave the driver? People complain daily about people who have to live of the government and use our tax dollars but only the government is to blame for it. Driving a car is not that hard. Why are we not using our advances in technology for better things like finding a cure for cancer? We should start using this intellagence for things that matter more. I am sure that there is a cure for cancer out there but if it is discoverd then millions of people would be out of jobs. The same goes for the computer cars it would leave someone without a job. I personally think that it is not a good idea. I think that there are worse problems out there than a lazy rich person not wanting to drive their car. It really is not that hard to drive a car. I do not like the idea of a computer driving a car. Like the article said, if there is an accident who would be at fault? The person or the car? I believe that people need to get a grip on reality and realize that computer cars are not a good idea."
1546,0,"The Challenge of Exploring Venus is an article where the author's main idea is to persuade the audience that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.The way the author supports the idea that studying Venus is worthy is very important since it depends from that if the author is going to convice the audience. Firstly, the author supports the idea by giving details and explaining how and why humans are so interested on exploring Venus. In the text, explains how ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too"". By this the author is telling the reader the first reason of many to study Venus with saying that Venus is the other planet that is more alike to earth and humans are so interested on exploring it to discover how the two planets can be similies and analogous. Secondly, the author gives examples of some of the dangers that it represents. ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus.... On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degress Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth"". The author states this to inform the reader about Venus environment, temperature and pressure; however, with these facts the readers may now be less convinced about Studying Venus being a good idea since they now might be thinking about the danger of humans trying to get into Venus. Lastly, the author introduces details about NASA working on approaches to studying Venus. Such as modern computers, or other devices. ""Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus"".with this the author is now trying to introduce how not only humans can be the only ones exploring and studting Venus, but NASA and other researchers might come up with some inovations that may be the success for Venus exploration. To conclude with, the author does support the idea that studying Venus is a wrothy pursuit despite the dangers in a nice and explanatory way. The author stayed on task, explains the pros and cons of exploring Venus but giving more details about it being worthy. He supported with details explaining how inovatory it could be to know more about Venus.The author for sure might convince the audience of its idea."
15495,0,"You should join to help and say I helped that country. I think you should because there are things you have and other people don't. I also think that it should almost be a requirement to help people to go to heaven. I think alot of things should because I am like that. I think a lot about others believe it or not. I love other people and apparently Luke did also. He understands the true meaning of love. He even knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime to help people in Africa,Asia,Haiti, and other places like that he had to understand that time is too valuable and other people give that time away to you to make you a better person and he is using it that way. Not saying this is all good there is downs too. Every rose has its thorns. It is a lot of time that people spend with others. It was better for Luke I think because he was a good person. He had a heart of steel to make himself not say no to miss out on people in his family to go help other families. I think that was the best thing to do for anybody. He missed his mom,dad,aunt,brother/sister,nephew/neices,and his other friend to go help other people. Which makes me wonder if he's a Mason. I know that he had to miss out because that was so much time taken up,not wasted but taken up. He spent 2 weeks on each trip and then did it 16 more times! Reasons not ot would be. You could die in fog. I'm not sayin I wouldn't go but I wouldn'tlike to have the thought of dying in my brain. I bet more than once or twice he thought of dying and cried. I know I would go but I wouldn't go 16 times because of the fact. There are sharks,squid,octopi,and plenty of other animals. The oceans are the most unexplored places on earth. People die millions of times a year because of the ocean and I have a high paranoia level so my paranoia would keep me on my toes. I would be so scared at times. There are 60 foot sharks named megalodons and can swallow me whole. There are plesiosaurs confirmed in the pacific. There is a six gilled shark that is 20 feet long. almost all sharks can taste a drop of blood 400 yards away. If they swim underneath a boat with 335 horses and 1 of 335 is bleeding or in labor. (the tissues and blood)I would die. I would probably have a heart attack. I can't stand my paranoia. My friend was going to let a train go over him to prove he wasn't scared but I put a little paranoia in him because under a train gets hot enough to crystalize a rock and make it look like silver. What would it do to my friend. Back to the water. Plesiasours started as lizards. Lizards have a third eye. It senses changes in lighting. Ripples and vibrations shift lighted areas. Horses make alot of noise and stomp alot. Stomping causes vibrations. I was swimming in a river and I thought about rivers monsters when a log touched my legs I freaked out! I swam as fast as I could screaming ""jeremy wade jeremy wade""I was out of the water and on my grandpas house boat. I said hit the sand dam. From then and on I never went past clear water. I don't think about stuff like look down its a log or stuff like that. I almost pee my pants when I see a spider. I think its because of me watching national geographic channel everyday and knowing what every animal does and how it hurts you. I thought one time a jamaican cockroach could kill me.At the time I was three or four. My finger now was about as long as this cockroach. it stood up and it ran towards me. I was in my moms work and there were alot of animals there so I ran into the pig room. That was the day I figured out my mom would get me a mexican rat. From then on No roach came near me.But my fear is still here."

In the passage it says that the car notifies the person when human assistance is needed ahead, which is something that could prevent wrecks or traffic jams. It also says something about the ""Traffic jam assistant"" which can steer, accelerate, and brake by themselves. ""Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reciever, and an intertial motion sensor. Which shows that its really safe. The brakes have a way better response and control than humans. The sensors detect and respond to out of control skids or roll overs, it applies brakes on the wheels and has a much better brake than humans. That is why i think driverless cars is a good idea, and it should be something that people look into and even if they do get big, not everyone has to get one only who wants one."

If he/she is bored the teacher can maybe think of a way to make the class a bit more fun or entertaining in a way. The text states ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This type of technology could also help with class debates were the teacher says something like who ever wants pizza raise your hand and who ever wants salad raise your hand.

5611,0,"This new technology is actually valuable. In the story they talk about how making yourself smile still can make you happy. This technology could really help because then they can tell if someone is really unhappy. Most people do not want other people to know what they are feeling but it helps people around you. This technology can tell you like what percent happy you are or digusted or fearful or angry. Like Mona Lisa's percentages were 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, and 2 percent angry. With people being able to know how people in paintings were feeling you can put together what might be happening or what they are trying to point out. This technology is actually very helpful because they can tell everything by just using a computer and using it on a painting to see what their emotions are. The computers can detect all 44 muscles in someone face. All the muscles have to move like human muscles. They say in the article that the movement of one or more muscles is called an action unit. The Eckman has classified six basic emotions and those emotions are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. An example they used by telling any of those is your frontalis pars laterials muscle which is above you eyes raises you eyebrows when you are surprised. A way they can tell that you are angery is when your orbicularis oris which are around your mouth tightens your lips. There are many different things that this technology can tell about you which could really help because it could let people around you know how you are feeling instead of having to answer and you just say your fine. Like you can kind of tell how a friend is feeling by just looking at their face. Everyone can have trouble describing like the reasons why they feel like that but atleast you can tell how they are feeling. Even if you do not know why they are feeling that way you can try and change how they are feeling. Like most people do not want to have to explain why they feel that way they just want a friend to be there for them and help you boost your mood. Computers are unstanding what peoples emotions are but they are still trying to figure out how to nonverbal communicate with someone. The article gives you instructions to do while looking in the mirror. The first instruction is to raise your lips at the corners of your mouth, the next one is to then squint your eyes slightly, to produce wrinkling at the corners of your eyes, the last one is holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up, toward your eyes. They ask if you express in the mirror suggest an emotion and it does it is a happy emotion. Experts can even tell by just looking at a celebrity and they can tell if the are being truthful about being happy or if the are sad. This technology could help many people. Do you just sit there sometimes and think what are they feeling or are they sad or happy well now you can tell by just doing some very easy things. Like you can use a computer that can recognize what you are feeling even if you are just sitting there doing something the computer can still tell. You can even learn ways to just look at someones face and can tell how they are feeling by just the muscles on their face. This can help friends they will be able to tell how their best friend is feeling and they can try and change their mood. Even if it does not seem helpful it really is, by just telling what someones emotions is by just looking at them can actually change a lot of things."
23638,0,"Most likely im in a car every day of my life and the odds are so are you. But What if cars were never invented how many lives would be saved? how much money could we save? And over all how much better and cleaner our world will be. These things are just some of the advanatges that pertains to limiting our car usage. Have you ever heard of the good out weighs the bad? well in this situation the good defiantly out weighs the bad. Our life source is breathing we need to breath air and at that fresh air, but we never are, not with fumes from millions of cars roaming around. Stated in (source3 par24) ""Its a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution"". That to me sounds like two gains already, whats better than fresh air and less stress. Things just as simple as car pooling makes the world better but what really would is not useing you'r car daily. No, i dont mean walk every where you could use bikes, eletric operated golf carts which are all fun but much better for the air. By useing these we have fewer fumes in the air which makes for better air. If we all began useing these instead of cars in just towns it would become normal to ride bikes and, golf carts rather than big bulky air killing machines. For an example in (source4 par29) ""Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"". It just starts with one to make something drastically change. Now i know were not gonna take family bike trips all the way from florida to georgia or drive a golf cart that only goes to 40mph,but thats when it would be decent to make a ""car trip"". Im not saying stop useing cars completely just only when its not neccassary. Just think about the world you live in the world that God has created is being pulluted every day, but we can all change that. Money, money,money Seems to be the big talk in America weather its the money were making, the money were loseing,or the money we just dont have. But Wouldent you rather put your money towards the mouths of your family or the roof over your head, rather than in your gas tank? Useing less cars would give us more money on more important things in life and, would cause more people to become happier. Just by useing things like bikes can make things more smoother in your every day life for an example(source3 par28) ""Rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic"". No one i know loves sitting or, nearly wrecking during traffic with this mehtod of less cars we could cut deaths and, stress in half. And i know you would say, but millions of people would lose jobs big money by car usage being reduced,but think of all the new things they could make their money from. People are always looking for the next big thing, well this is it. Dealerships that promote this could now turn into safer mobility shops and, make nearly as much. Stated in(source4 par32) ""Americans could not afford new cars and the unemployed wernt going to work anyway"". This goes to show that were already leaning towards the idea of less cars we just need to be pushed. All the new inventions that will arise weather its cute bicycle covers to built in tops to block the rain people will be gaining and saving just as much. But what were really gainig is the saftey of people. Kids fall off their bikes everyday and probably get hurt but, a scrape is better than taking your last breath. We all gain from this, and our human nature is to want whats best for yourself, well this is surely better for every one. Almost every day im in a vehicle, but maybe that could soon change. We could gain so much from losing just a little bit of driving time. We would absolutley gain lives,money,and happiness from useing less car usage. Im a firm beliver in useing this method i couldent imagine a better world of things going just so smoothly all of the time. But It takes getting on that bike or walking to the corner store to strike a revolution like this. So get out of your cars and, go make a better place for you and for the world."
5209,0,"The Facial Action Coding System is valuable to have in a classroom. This is a great idea because if a student is lost or confused about the class or work they're doing, this computer detects it and the teacher would help. In the other hand I think most people would not like this idea because this computer would know everything and how a person might be feeling, not everybody likes to tell people what they feel at the moment. The Facial Action Coding System can be the same technology to make computer-animated faces more expressive, for video games and video surgery. Also humman communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. Meanwhile they also use muscles to show espression. Sometimes teachers know how you feel if they know you for a while the face expressions they make. Some people just don't even make expressions they always have a serious face on and people that you have known for a long time such as friends, familiy ect. You know them and if something is wrong you will let them know. This computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code. Also a cool idea to see how the students feel thst day for class, everyone shpuld be happy. The theory of emotion moving your facial mucsles not only expresses emotions."

Venus has a lot of dangers that are having NASA question what Venus is really like. Each day NASA trys to find more answers on how to overcome those dangers to see what is on Venus. Each time that NASA has sent a spacecraft into space to reach Venus they haven't returned. In the passage it states, ""Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades.""

There are a lot of reasons that could contribute to this Venus is the second planet close to the sun. Couldn't Venus be getting all the gasses from the sun? It's possible by how hot the sun is and how close Venus is to the sun. The amount of gasess and minerals that are floating throught the air are dangerous.

All of these conditions are to much for a human or any type or automotive to handle. Venus is like a poision its air and soil. Just imagining how all of it got here is hard to believe. Venus has a dense atmosphere causing us to not behable to get photographic imagry. In the passage it states, ""However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and vidography ineffective."" It will be hard for researcher or NASA to get samples of Venus's soil or anyting to start studying what is going on, and why the planets atmosphere is contaiminated with to much elements. Researchers are not giving up hope on trying take a look at Venus. In the text it states, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itseslf, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on Earth and beyonf should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be explanded to meet the very edges of imaginations and innovation."" The people on Earth want to find out what is on Venue and this is a challenge that they are willing to take. The dangers on Venus are what is striving us to want to do these travels more because we are curious like the passage stated. Therefore, Venus may bring us dangers but it is leading us to challenges that we are going to conqure. Venus is not ready to be explored because of the different mixed elements that are making it hard to discover and test. That is why we want to take on this challenge more and more everyday to know what is the cause of Venus and everything on it's planet."

The UNRRA hired us to help recover other countries' food supplies, animals, and more. We went there in August 1945. You should join the program. If your 18 or older, you could do that for military services and be discharged. You might be able to go to Greece. If you're lucky enough you could see the Acropolis. Or mabye you'll go to China or Italy. If you go to China you might be able to see the Panama Canal on your way. You should enjoy your time as a Seagoing cowboy and be careful.You could take a Gondola ride in Venice, Italy. If you had some type of preparation it could help you with the animals. If you're on night watch on the boat you would have to check the animals every hour. When on nightwatch you should be careful of anything you could slip on. When I was in thw UNRRA, I had a lot of fun. I was able to play many games. Sometimes I play baseball ansd volleyball. Other times I played table-tennis tournaments, fencing, and even boxing, They helped pass some free time. Im sure you would have a great time as a Seagoing Cowboy. You would have the time of your life. You could also meet new people and friends. Finally you could learn about different people and thier way of life.Join the UNRRA today."

NASA says that it is ""huge rock formation"" meaning that it was made naturally. ""on april 5, 1998 Michael Malin and his camera snnaped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos."" This revealed that it was only a natural land form. There was no alien monument after all. NASA seaches for life because they think that since ther is a face on mars then ther has to be some one to make thet face on Mars. But there really is not any life on mars it is a giant rock giving the illusion that it has eys, mouth,and nose. All of this is somthing that happend natural.

One reason was that it was an expirience of a life time,he does what he likes to do,and he gets free time to do fun things. Thoes are the reasons why Luke's point of view convinces others to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. I can support this answer that the Seagoing Cowboy's program was an expirience of a life time when the passage says ""but the Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger"".""It opended up a new world for him"". I can also support that it was an exprirence of a life time when the text says,""I'm greatful for this for this opportunity,""he says.""It makes me more aware of people in other contries and their needs.""thats the reason that it was an expirience of a life time.

10288,0,"Many people think that the face are created by aliens. Myself thinking i dont think aliens are real. This face from Mars in 1976 is natural form from Earth. We're still researching on the real idea of what is may have came from in the pass years. Also, many says it may be a reflected or shadow from something. Other scientist conclude that it may be just rocks in a hug formation which resembles a human head formed by shadows or dust giving illusion of eyes, nose,and mouth. They called it ""The Face on Mars."" Most of the commuication of it started in a Hollywood film. Appeared in books,magazines, radio talk shows, even hauted grocery store checkoutlines for 25 years. I think theres just a rock with holes in the it, looking like a human face but no one will never know til someone takes the trip to find out. By many think it was aliens creating it, people just assummed that idea. Other scientist still today wonder what it really is or how was it really created. There may have been a ancient civilization on Mars years ago. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting for research to post a better and good viewer of the Face on Mars. Im thinking, by revealing alot of research, taking pictures and not approving that the face isnt changed by the amount of days and years, that it may just be a natural landform and that theres no aliens monument after all. There will still be other thinking and having their own opinions about the Face on Mars. Everyone wont just be satisfied with one fact or option about the face. Still many and most scientist are till snapping camera shots of the face and posting them on the web. More and more people and scientist will have diiferent thoughts about it and the world will never know what is going and what is it really until someone actually observed face to face. In my opinion, I think by wasting time doing research on something so little that have been lasting for years, no one never had the time to really go observe the reality about the face. Doing this research and conclude things will never tell the people answers about what the face."

Bringing the Facial Action Coding System to existences can be a great thing. It's fairly easy to know how somebody is feeling simply by the look on their face, but that usually just gives off one emotion. With the Facial System in use it will be capable of giving off multiple emotions on how somebody is feeling. Also, with the system it will be easier to detect Whether somebody is lying or telling the truth. It'll be easier to detect because the percent numbers from your emotions with identify everything your feeling whether its, gulit,mad,sad etc. Another thing that is cool about this system is that it's not just used for the computer it also can be used for game systems and video sugery. Being able to read emotions from other people using technolgy is cool. supporting this movement can be a big step for this generation. Also,bringing new technology into this world can change the world in many ways."
20648,0,"Driverless cars. We've all seen them in movies and on tv. Do they really work? In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. I am against the use of driverless cars because it would cause more accidents, if the technology fails you might be the one to blame, and drivers would get bored just sitting there. Driverless cars would cause more accidents. They would cause more accidents because if some person were to be sitting in the car and fall asleep and the car needed the person to drive through construction the person wouldn't know. Another example is, if someone were to go get drunk and get in the car, they would probably think that they wouldnt need to drive it, since it's supposed to be driverless, which would most likely result in a crash. People would take advantage of this car for reasons such asbeing able to sleep on a long drive or being able to get home safely drunk. People would forget that they have to drive this car if there are things like consruction or accidents. If the technology of the car fails, you might be the one to blame if in an accident. This is just horrible because the person driving the car is not the one who built the car or anything; so why should the person sitting behind the wheel need to pay? If the technology fails then it is the manufacturer's fault. If the people begin getting blamed for the tchnology of the car, they will begin to hate the driverless cars. This would cause people to stop purchasing them, which would cause the manufacturers to stop making money. Drivers would get bored just sitting there because they obviously bought a car to drive it; why would they want one that could drive itself? In the passage even Dr. Werner Huber, a BMW project manager driver admitted that, ""The phychological aspects of automation are really a challenge."" I know some of you may be thinking, ""What are you talking about? Driverless cars sound great."" But you would eventually get tired of being driven around. If you're being driven around all the time then you might lose the independent feeling of driving. In conclusion, I am against the use of driverless cars because it would cuase more accidents, if the technology fails you might be the one to blame, and drivers would get bored just sitting there. Technology is taking over our society. Don't let it happen. Don't let driverless cars take away the independent feeling you get when driving your car. Driverless cars will only cause more people to use them as a ride home when drunk and to sleep in; and i get that sounds great but you might get in an accident and you just might be the one who is blamed."
11484,0,"With the advancement in technology in the world we live in today, there should be no surprise of a car with the capabilities to drive itself. Though it does give technology yet another human job, driverless cars should be manufactored. I do not believe they should be maufactored for the average person though. Driverless cars should be manufactored for the blind, elderly, or anybody who does not have the driving capabilities that most have. Driverless cars should be manufactored for the elderly. Very few people above the age of 70 have the driving capabilites and safety they once did when they were younger. For this reason, a driverless car would be ideal and safe for them to use for transportation. The driverless car would be a safe and effective transportation method for the elderly, this is one reason why driverless car should be manufactored. Another reason the driverless car should be manufactored is how it will help the fight against drunk driving. With the computer at the wheel, and not the drunk driver, this could prevent from an accident or even a death. Though they could take control of the wheel, the computer system could be capable of recognizing such danger with the sensors, and take over for safety. The driverless car would be good to develop so that it could help in the fight against drunk drivers and other intoxicated drivers. My final reason that the driverless car should be developed is so that the handicapped could have an easier time with transportation. The blind, the wounded, and the deaf all have their diffuculties with transportation. With the advancement in technology and cars, this would make it easier for them to get from one place to another. With the technology driving for them, they won't have to worry about there disability affecting them. With a safe driverless car developed, the handicapped community would get a better way of transportation. In conclusion, technology is not always meant for fun. When the technology can greatly improve the life of the eldery or handicapped, it should be developed or used. When the technology can keep other drivers on the road safe from intoxicated driving, it should be developed and used. The driverless car can do all of the above, which is why it should be developed and used."
12913,0,"Our world is changing. People try to improve things we use most in daily life. Cars is a highly used mode of transportation and Sergey Brin is on a quest to improve daily use of cars. Many positives and negatives can be found in the use of driverless cars. I find that if something is not good, make it better. If people find many flaws in driverless cars, then I see a need to improve it. I think the idea of a driverless car should be futher developed until the positives clearly outweigh the negatives. I think that driverless cars could be very valuble in the future. The driverless car comes with many benefits. One of the major upsides of a driverless car is hypothetically safer than a car with a human driver. Human drivers are subject to drunk driving, sleeping while driving, and overall human errors. In a world of all cars being driverless cars, commute from destination to destination would be more efficient. The estimated time from place to place would be more exact as cars would be traveling the quickest route consistently. People would also be traveling legally at the right speed. As it says in paragraph one, gas expenses would also go down. When the car knows where it is going, there is no route to get lost on, therefore less distance traveled, less money spent on gas. People can also pay a lot of money towards fines and other crash related expenses. Ideally, driverless cars would eliminate the penalty of speeding and would hopefully eliminate the expenses of a crash. However, the idea of a driverless car is still in the making. Driverless cars can also come with various disadvantages. One of the most obvious downsides of a driverless car is price. The price of a driverless car would be insane. In paragraph four and five, the passage mentions the various sensors needed in order to mimic the ability of a human driver. It also says, ""Sensors are nothing new, of course."" However, cars with these sensors in them are known to cost more than most cars. Not to mention the act of adding many more sensors which would continue to the raise the price of this vehicle. Another downside this passage brings up is the idea of liability. In a perfect world, we would like to imgaine a perfect car that would never get in accidents or collisions. However, we know that accidents are possible due to pedestrians, bikers, natural reasons and more. So liability comes into play when an accident is on hand. Depending on the situation, who is to blame? There is yet to be laws made in order to determing this question, but the idea of driverless cars remain the same. Driverless cars need to be improved, investigated, and developed more before they are determined to be logical modes of transportation for our world today. I think the idea of a driverless car makes sense, but much more research needs to resolve these negative downsides. In order for the driverless car to product the people want, the price would have to be reasonable and the saftey of the passengers would need to be ensured. I think driverless cars should be further developed before they are put into the world of today."
1852,0,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author does a good job to prove that Venus is a worhty pursuit despite the dangers that are presented, they do this by giving information based on actual conditions, studies and actual experiences. The author used a combination of all three of these to prove their claim that Venus is worth the danger. The conditions in Venus are a great mix of specific material. The author thoroughly explains each part of the atmosphere in Venus. The text says that "" These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an enviroment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquify metals."" They are proving that the conditions on Venus would exceed anything that our bodies could handle. Despite saying this, they make a point when they begin into the discussion of the education it could bring us. In the text it is shown that ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet it our solar system."" The author supports his argument very well when they say this. They used a status stand point which gives the author more credibility. He then forms a question within the text, by doing this it brought them the opportunity to show the research they had conducted for this writing piece. The author brought in the research on the true experiments that were thought up through NASA. He builds up NASA's ideas by explaining to the deepest points, but never hits an oppostion until the next paragraph. When they do this it creates an amazing idea that could have the possibility to work imaged into the readers heads. They eventually hit the oppostition and shows the down fall with NASA's great plan. They state in the text that "" More importatnly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and persoanl despite the risks."" When the author decides to say this they prove the irony of it all. If you can't be up close and personal with the planet then you can't learn the reasons you truly cannot be. From the opposing standpoint it was supported very well once they did that. They then go back on track to support their claim. They do this by explaining the experiments done in the past. They state a comparison to the readers when they say, "" Just imagine exposing a cell phone tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin,"" This comment that was made impacts the writing positvely. When they do this it gives the readers something to think about or imagine. It brings the issue to them and gives them a chance to relate somehow. The conclusion that he provides gives a clear closing. He states his claim again and uses his evidence to bring the topic to a point. The closing gives you something to think about, it leaves you wondering about the topic and forming your own opinions. In the conclusion it states, "" Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet te very edges of imagination and innovation."" The right thing is to not starve us from the education that could be provided just because of a dangerous boundary. All of the evidence that they have stated and proven through the whole essay just ends with them eventually just stating that it is the right thing to do. The author does a good job of proving this through the whole essay."
21548,0,"Dear State Senator Should the Electoral College be kept in favor? The electoral college does avoid the problem of elections. Well on the other hand, Richard Nixon,Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole agreed to abolish the elctoral college and change to election by popular vote for the president of the U.S.It is unfair to the voters because the electors elect the president. Also, not only are the voters voting for electors,they are voting for the canidate's electors when they think they're voting for the canidate. Choosing a president should be elected by the popular vote of people not electors. To start with,the president of the United States should be elected by the popular vote of the people. The president is there to guide and lead the people. The citizens of the U.S should have the right to vote for who they think should be president. For instance,some residents have a feeling that their votes don't count. To add,it is unfair to the voters because the elctors elect the the president. Eventhough the electors represent your state,they don't let the people choos who they desire for president. When voting for president, it shouldn't be all about the electors. The Electoral College even has the possibility of turning voters away that voted for a canidate that has no hope for supporting their state. Further more,the electoral college does avoid problems. Meaning,a canidate cannot receives a certain amount of the votes cast. For instance, when a canidate has more votes than other canidates while not receiving a clear majority oof votes.

4911,0,"The use of technology to determine the emotional expression of students in a classroom is not valuable. I personally do not think that a computer can analyze a human face and determine in percentages what their emotions are. A human can not be 2% angry and 75% happy. A computer can only determine what looks like on the outside, but not in the inside. We humans can guess by looking at someone if they are upset, furious, meloncholoy, or estatic. Humans can determine that by their body character or their facial expressions. We cry when we are angry, sad, or happy. A computer could not know that. We ask how they're feeling and most of the time humans can lie about their emotions. They tend to hide them within a smile or a laugh. People may look angry, but that's their natural face expressions. In a room full of students, you are going to get many different emotions depending on what time it is during the day. If it's the morning, students will most likely be tired or sleepy. If it's around noon they may be hungry. During the afternoon students will most likely to be ready to leave school. The time of day can have a mega impact on a person's mood. A computer may have an estimated guess on a person's mood, but it will never determine it. Us humans are special. We have many different ways we express emotion. We may feel many emotions at the same time, but a computer system could not determine that. We change how we feel all the time. We may not express it either. The FACS system may mistake our emotions through one picture. They could see a picture of you crying and decided that your sad, but in reality you're crying of laughter. In my opinion, you can not decide the expression of Mona Lisa just by looking at one painting. If they had a document saying she was happy most of the time her portrait was painted, then would believe it. Since they don't, I don't believe in anything FACS has documented. The use of technology can not determine ones emotion(s). Only we can decide on what we feel or how others feel. I strongly believe that we are the only ones who can see emotion."
24329,0,"The electoral college is viewed by the populace as a greedy snake who is suffocating the voters freedom and placing it in a slate of electors. According to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the election over 60% of the voters would abolish the electoral college and put in a direct election. The system is set up to where you may recieve the most votes yet lose the election so much for a ""democracy"". Yet some people still argue that the electoral college isnt flawed and fairly represents everyone. When one votes you are voting not for a president but for a slate of electors who then elect the president. These electors are not forced to vote for the cantidate you picked and in the past have not. Not only that but also the fact that the electoral college has the possibility for a tie (at that point the senate would elect the vice president) (state delegation would elect the president) this would completely abolish and not reflect the will of the voters. At its core the electroal college is unfair to the people it is a rigged winner-take-all system in each state since most candidates dont even take the time in the states they know they are going to win forsure or have no chance on winning. In the 2000 campaign 17 states didnt see the cantidates at all. Some of the ludicrous claimes made by supporters of the electral college are that you avoid run off elections, the so called ""certainty of outcome"", and many other outlandish claims which always avoid all the bad the electoral college does and only focus on the so called ""good"". It is a fact the people prefer a direct vote, the electoral college is unfair, outdated and is holding us back from expressing our full right to vote."
19915,0,"I think that driverless cars aren't an appropriate idea for this time period. There are multiple reasons why I believe this. We would need to do a lot more developing on roads, we would need to put an abundance of sensors in the car, there would need to be new laws made, and there's no practical use to a driverless car. Firstly, there are very few roads in America, let alone Indiana, that would be suitable for a driverless car. Many roads have unexpected twists, turns, and dips that no sensor would be able to make a fast enough reaction time. If the sensors stopped working, or if there wasn't a fast enough reaction time, it would cause multiple wrecks. If we had to fix a majority of the roads for driverless cars, taxes would go up to pay for it. Nobody would want to pay that kind of money, especially when most people wouldn't be able to afford a driverless car. Secondly, there would need to be an abundance of sensors in the car. Sensors aren't necessarily a bad invention for a car, but people shouldn't solely rely on them. Multiple things could go wrong with the sensors, sometimes without the driver or car even knowing. If the driver doesn't know that a sensor isn't functioning, they could be relying on it to mimic them at the wheel. Multiple wrecks could happen this way, and the only person to blame would be the driver with the driverless car, because they're the car who had their sensors malfunction. Thirdly, there would be too many laws that would need to be changed and added. Paragraph nine says, ""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times."" A human driver is needed to make these laws and to enforce them. There would have to be new liability laws, and there would be conflict with the manufacturing company. Technology is the not the subject that should be at fault in this situation. The person who should be at fault is the driver, because the driver would be putting themselves, and everyone on the street at risk for driving a car that they are not in control of. Lastly, there's no practical use for a driverless car. Driving is a privledge for young adults and adults. People are not given the right to drive, but they're given the privledge. There couldn't be anything more important for a driver than to focus on driving. If driverless cars are released to the public, what would people do while their car is being driven? They could sit on their phones or do something that wouldn't be worth their life or someone elses. Manual cars have been around for an abundance of years, and they've been doing just fine. To sum this up, I believe that driverless cars are not worth the risk, or money, in people's lives. There would be too much developing roads and laws, and there would always be the risk of the driver not being in control of their car."

The reasons you should go is that you can see new places that you have most likely never seen before or have never visited before. You will have an experience of how to take care horses,young cows,and mules that would be shipped from place to place. But along the way you'll find out what it feels like to take care these animals like as if you were on a farm because these are animals that would be on a farm. Besides you could try new food that you could have never tried in your life. You could have a chance to meet new people. Also while in that place you could experience what their culture is and also what they do in that culture. The only places you would go to though would be italy,china,new orleans,and greece.

The use the technology that allows people to read the emotional expressions of studnets in a clssroom is valuable because, it can help the teachers think about what they can do to make that student student have a better day, and it can help teachers learn the different facial expressions that connect with the certain emotions to help them determine how a student is really feeling. The use of this technology would be valuabe because, it can help teachers think about what they can do to help a student. The use of this technology can help decide whether a student really understands the work given to them of if there just lying becuase they don't want to ask questions because of what others might think. For example when I looked at the painting of Mona Lisa I thought that she wasn't a happy person but, I realized i was wrong the first sentence of the first paragraph stated that "" She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgustedd, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. The use of this technology can also be valuable because, it can help teachers learn the different facial expressions that connect with certain emotions to help them see how a student is really feeling. This may be able to help teachers stop altercations from accuring because the Facial Action Coding System will allow the teacher to see how angry or upset the student may be. For example if a person is really angry the system will dectect that. Overall the Facial Action Coding System would be very valuable.This article has helped me to be able to detect certain emotions a peron may have. This system would give teachers better understanding about how students are feeling.

The computer can tell if a person is feeling sad or happy by telling there facial expression when a add comes up. the computer can tell they are not happy the computer well send a happier add on the next one to try to help you feel better or calm down. "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Haung predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructer."" If a student is feeling sad or mad if they smile even if they dont want to research shows that when students or adults or in a sad mood if they just put a smile on there face it will put them in a better mood then what they where in. "" According to the facial feedback theory of emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" When a renowned drama coach had his students put a frowning or smiling face on the actors to create those emotions and it actually worked for those actors to perform better on stage. "" A renowend drama coach, Constantin Stanislavsky, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage."" My thoughts on this article is that if you put a smile on your face even if your not happy that it actually works and if computers could tell people,ood then we can prevent a lot of acciednts from happing and we can put students who are stressed out or not in a good mood it will cheer them up and leave a postive atitude about most sitituations that kids or even adults go threw everyday."

I can see a lot of people not listenig to the rules like keeping your eyes on the road. I can see more people looking away and going on phones. With cars now, people look and text on their phones, which they should't be,but I can see more people looking on their phones with driverless car. The driverless car can have many problems with it not working corretly. And if the car does fail their are gonna be many problems to figure out who's fault it is. In the article it says, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacture?"" The only thing I can see it good for would be for drunk drivers, it would still be illegal but it would be safer. I think it would be better to have drivers driving the car then to have driverless cars. It would be safer to have a driver driving the car. Their wouldn't be new laws. Not as many cases of who's fault it is."

I worry that if we were to have a nationwide powersurge we'd be sitting ducks. but a couple decades earlier I think we could have been alright. When you are talking with someone you shouldn't rely on tech to tell you how they're feeling, personally I think it's inhumane. I should be able to look at someone and by they're expression (which the computer reads) I myself alone should be able to tell what they are feeling, and if not then you can ask them with your words like a human being would. We aren't robots we don't need to ask siri how are loved ones are feeling. It completely takes away the joys of bonding and in the case of mona lisa, the elegance of mystery. I personally love art and portraits because it's fun to try and figure out what they are thinking and then ask someone else what they think because that person might have a different idea. Using technology would take away peoples idea to different veiw points of the same portrait. I think we should rely on ourselves to figure out what mona lisa is thinking. Personally to me, she looks like a caring guardian kind of woman, maybe a mother or loved one. Going back the text says she was 83% happy, 9%disgusted, 6%fearful, and 2%angry. I say it's 100% up to you. In the case of the students what if the picture is taken when they blink? Or if they sneeze? Jane could be having a really sad day and the picture could be taken at the worng moment and say she was ecstatic. You can rely on tech for these readings you need to read them face to face. Ask them how they are feeling, don't just run up and snap a pic. In conclusion, use your words and ask how someone is feeling!"
10708,0,"Driverless Cars. The idea and fantasy of many futuristic fanatics out there. When one would think of diverless cars, they may think of a flying car or a talking car that does everything for one. This idea comes from the many movies and books out there that like to predict the future, and quite frankly should stay in the movies only. The idea of driverless cars should continue being make believe simply because there are a lot more cons than pros. The fact that driverless cars are in the making as we speak is crazy and scary. They are simply not safe, imagine not having control over the car and it going haywire and crashing. This idea is apparently suppose to lessen the amount of accidents that go on in the world, but in reality it may be the cause for many more People in this day and age are not mature, they are not mature enough to handle a driverless car. they would most likely take advantage of it, for example this may give people more of a reason to get drunk and high mor because they arent the ones driving. Anything can go wrong and a driverless car in the hands of a drunk is not a very great idea. The article was very broad when it came to the safety precaution and features to this driverless cars. If what the article said was true about the driver having to take over if something was to happen, then what if the driver was drunk or not in their right mind? A crash would happen. In the article, it talked about all the sensors and cameras they would include in this unbelieable car not willing to mention how much it would cost. With all these fancy sensors and cameras, the price has got to be real expensive. With driverless cars and regular cars all driving on the same road, something is bound to go wrong. The upside to a driverless car is if they get all the problems and precautions figured out in the near dear future, just like the article stated, it could change the world. If one wanted to go on a long road trip, they wouldnt have to worry about driving the whole way. According to article gas wouldnt be needed as much so the prices would go down, but the world is not there yet not even close. Driverless cars could be an amazing devllopment in the future but not in this lifetime. The world that inhabits the people of the world today is not mature and ready yet for this kind of devlopment. The world has bigger problems that needs to be sorted out before dirverless cars cars can even become a thing in the future. It could a great devlopment for the world but we have a long way to go yet."

There are several reasons why this system is valuable. One way the F.A.C.S is valuable to a classroom is you can do more things in science contributed to emotions and human qualities. Even if you tried to fake your emotions in the classroom you couldn't. When you first start the process of detecting your emotions, it has to make a 3-D model of your face, and make sure all the mucles move like human muscles. According to the text, ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness."" These special skills can not only help you read people, but also F.A.C.S. teaches you about a whole new life to underatnd people, and they way they feel. Mnay different people will take this system and use it in so many different ways, and try so many new things with it. I personally think that this will be very valuable to normal people like us and, everyday scientists, and especially throughout the school coprorations. This system is very valuable to the school system, because it doesn't just let you try new things but it can also keep you up to date on how people are doing and feeling.

On paragraph 2 of the article ""The Challenges of Exploring Venus"", the author states that Venus is often reffered to as Earth's ""twin"" since it is the closest (aside from Mars) looking to Earth when is comes to desity and size. The author feels Astronomers may find existing life forms since most of Venus was probably covered in large oceans and Venus still, has some look-alike features to Earth such as; Valleys, moutains and craters. Since Venus is the nearest planet to Earth, many Astronomers also believe Venus could be our option for planetary visit, the planet is safe for humans to survive in anyway. On paragraph 8, the author states ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet istelf, but also becuase human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally endeavors."" meaning, traveling to Venus could have some good surprises waiting. The author also states in that very paragraph, ""Our travels on Earth and beyong should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" Meaning he is all for dangers as long as he is able to meet the ""very edges of imagination and innovation"" as he quotes."

The idea of having a car that can drive itself while you do less driving while the car does most of the driving sounds appealing. This can help many people such as, for example, the eldery people. But, with any new piece of technology, it comes with a cost. Google is well known company to many people including myself. This company is known to employee many creative people. As it seems, Google has made something very, very thoughtful. It is the driverless car. A car that drives itself for many miles and not crash. Where can I get one of these? They are not for sale yet as Google has only recently, in the past years, created this. Google has modified a Toyota Prius with seensors all over the car to sense the environment around the car. This makes it so you will be notified if any possible mishaps could occur, it can be prevented. As technology is always advancing present day, so does the car. Things such as driver assistance and antilock brakes have been created to help prevent more accidents. Even if such mechanics can be created, the car still needs a driver. And so does Google's driverless car, why would I want a car that still needs a driver? Well man has always been better than machine and a car always needed a driver. This adds that the driver has control in the end but the car is still safe. Yet, whoever is driving is a problem. If you get in a wreck, who is responsible? The car or the driver? Driverless cars will be a problem not only in the streets, but in court as well. New laws will have to be created for driverless cars and controversy will happen over the driver's injury in an accident. This will be a long agruement and battle between the driver and the manufacturer. This is a negative but with owning a car comes with responsibility. New cars are made every year. Anything from new models, new assistance technology, new features, and new types of cars. We should never be afraid of the future, there is no way to stop it. Think of the great new ways technology can be used for. Ready? Go."

Some people believe that Smart Cars are a negative because was if something happens to the technology who is going to be responsbile the driver or the manufacturer. Although,I would have to say Smart Cars are a postive, because the Smart Cars would have sensors, and speeds up to 25 miles per hour, and the Smart Car is controlled by technology so the car can control itself through accidents, break itself, amd through work zones. Adding to that, the Smart Car lets you know when there is a problem accuring and it gets your attention. First, Smart Cars are a postive aspect to driverless cars because the cars would have sensors. The sensors would monitor the surrounding of the Smart Car. In the aricle its says,"" auto makers used speed sensors at the wheels in the creation of antilock breakes. With in 10 years, those sensor have become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-controll skids or rollovers"". The sensors are placed everywhere aound the car such as:on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, and 4 automatic radar sensors etc. Meanwhile, those are just some of the places. Next, the Smart Cars can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 miles per hour. In the article it says, "" But special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. In facts, non of the cars developed so far one completetely driverless. With that being said, the Smart Car isn't completely driverless, the driver is still driving just not the entire time. The driver is needed when pulling in or out of a driveway. Also when there is an accident or a problem. Then,since the Smart Cars are controlled by technology, the car can control itself through accidents,break itself, and throught work zones. The Smart Car also lets the driver know if there is something wrong. In the article it states, ""They can steer, accelerate, and break themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. This means the human drivers must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires. The necessitaties the care being ready to quickly get the drivers attention whenever the problem occur. GM has developed driver's seats to vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. Finally, Smart Cars, are a postive aspect of driverless cars because, they have sensors, good breaks, and still need drivers to control them. Although, some people might think its negative because whos going to be the one responsible if the technology messes up the driver or the manufacturer, it would have to fall back on the driver and the manufacturer. The Smart Cars have been tested so they should be postive and smart aspect."

As well as a average tempature of over 800 degrees fahrenheit and a atmospheric pressure of over 90 times stronger than that of earths. As you can see very valid points to the danger you will face to researching this waste land of a planet so why would someone waste such good time and resources for research on a planet we may never even get to inhabit?

Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional imediments like urupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface. Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it mat well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life. Venus still has some features that are analogous, the planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Venus can be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. NASA has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans. Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to llast long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus. NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. Some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide hace been tested in chamber simulathing the chaos of Venus's surface."

20255,0,"I think that driverless cars are good and bad. A car that navigates its own self, doesn't need a driver to take control of it, uses less fuel, and is controlled by a computer is most likely to be our future. We all want to do greater things, invent grather things, but we should also realize that some things can be thought of but not created. A driverless car has its ups and downs because if no human being is in control it could represent a bad aspect or a bad one. One good thing that comes to the top of my head is elderly people. This would be really useful to the elderly, especially because of muscle or bone aches. It reduces the number of crashes but could also influence them. The computer or whatever is controlling the car could misfunction or something could go wrong, therefore the car could end up crashing or causing an accident. Humans have the most control on a car. They decide the speed, direction, their surrondings. A computer could do thst too but not as acurate as a human would. Yes it is a very interesting thing thst could happen in the future but are we sure that we would want a machine to take over rather than a human. There are lots of arguements that can be done about this. Some people may agree, some people may not and thats fine because we all have different opinions. Driverless cars still have a long way before they can just change what has been achieved for more that maybe 80 years or so, and thats humans having full control."

Scientists have the hope of Venus being a place esxplored by humans some day in the future and maybe with new technology that would be possible. On my point of view, Venus is worthy the studying not only beause it is the closest to Earth but also because when Earth is destroyed by humans Venus can be the new Earth, hopefully humans will change their minds when Earth is destroyed and they won't want the new Earth to be destroyed. If scientists are succesfull in sending humans to study Venus, probably in a future th planet can be saved, it won't be as hot as it is now and it won't be as dangerous. Althought because of the dangerous it is at this point Venus won't be able to get reached and studied. In conclussion Venus is a dangerous but studying worthy planet that may or may not be explored by humans in a distant future, Venus itself can possibly be discovered with advanced technology, it's surface it too hot for the technology we have now but hopefully Scientist will discover something to explore and get to know earth's twin, who knows maybe in a far away future we may be living in Venus, and hopefully humans will change for good."

A natural lanscape happens when a earthquake happens and it forms something completely different that was there before that landscape was there. In paragraph 7 it states that "" There was no alien monument after all."" So that goes to show that aliens did not shape that face on Mars! It was a natural landscape. But the story also says that not everyone was satisfied with the fact that they proved. How can aliens make the face when we are watching the planet? I mean don't you think we would see them making the landscape? The aliens wouldn't have made that quick. They don't have any special tools that can make a specific sculpture like that so quick. What im trying to say is that i know aliens have alot to do with our past, but they didn't make what you guys this just like you guys thinkk they did. If you can't belive what we are trying to tell you all, then i don't know who you belive. We watched the plaent for more than 25 years! So i think we know what we are talking about.

It seems unlikely that many people would depend on driverless cars. In my own opinion, I think that driverless cars would be neat but can also cause many problems that would result in difficult situations to figure out who will take responsibility. I also think the law will agree with my opinion as stated in the text, ""Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers.

5064,0,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", it talks about a new technology that enables computers to identify human emotions. The new technology is called Facial Action Coding System. At the very beginning of the article, it talks about the emtions of Mona Lisa for she is eighty-nine percetnhappy, nine percent disgusted, six percent fearful and two percent angry. Honestly, if I was forced to sit for hours and stare at nothing while some old guy painted my picture, I would not be very happy about it. The technology works by constructing a 3-D computer model of the face that it has been presented with all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Dr. Paul Eckman, the creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding SYstem) has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness. In paragraph six, Dr. Huange predicts that a classroom computer could recognize whena student is becoming confused or bored then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. As a student n high school, I honestly do not believe that Facial Action Coding System is necessary for a classroom. Our biology teacher makes the notes for us herself so the computer would have no way of changing anything to make it interesting. Along with the fact that most human communication us nonverbal, inclusing emotional communicaton, the computer need to understand that also. I believe that this Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a waste of time when there are more important matters at hand in this world. WIth the recent school shootings, I believe that we should be spending more time trying to make different types of affective things to protect students when a shooter enters a school. I saw an article about how a school has recently installed bullet proof ""rooms"" into every classroom. Whenever someone comes over the intercom, telling the school that they are under attack, the students rush into the room that can hold up to thriy to forty kids. This is what we should spend more time with. Making sure our students are safe, not trying to figure out whether the emtions of students while in class or the emotions of a painting from a few hundred years ago. Now, I am not saying that FACS would not be helpful in some cases. It could be used with therapists who have patients that do not want to cooperate with them or a patient in a metnal hospital. The effectiveness in a classroom is very low in many cases. The facts that they can recognize the human emotion based on the muscles of the face like the zygomatice major (muscles that begin at your cheek bones) lift the corners of your mouth. Yes it does seem interesting but like I said before, it should not be used in a classroom. I believe the only communication that we should have with computers is emailing and other types of work, like typing out the next best-selling book."
15476,0,"I know that it is a very debatable question, but the Face wasn't made by aliens but simply just a natural landform. If you don't believe me then I can give you a few facts that should justify my answer. And no, these are not just opinions they are indeed facts. The first clue as to why the Face is just a natural landform is that in April 5, 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Mars with Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera. In line seven it states that after the photos were taken and posted online fore people to see, all the pictures revealed was a natural landform with no alien markings what so ever. Another reason is that on April 8, 2001 NASA had once again sent their mars Global Surveyor up into space to get an even closer look at the face on account so many people didn't believe that it was just a natural landform. The camera that they used to take the pictures with made each pixel in the photos span from 1.56 meters, as said in line ten. Even after they had taken the photos again witha more advanced camera, the images only showed what resembled a butte or mesa, stated in line 12, and once again no evidence of alien markings. Those are the two reasons as to why the Face is only a natural landform and not an alien monument. NASA has taken pictures of it two times already and even with a more uprgraded camera they still didn't find evidence that aliens ever created it."
16831,0,"In my own opinion I think that cars should not become driveless for many different reasons. My first reason is cars should'nt become driveless because what if something goes wrong with the car and the car lose control. Another reason would be if the car have late reactions or notify the driver on something late. Cars should never be driveless because of those reasons but for other reasons as well. Such as,driveless cars would probably be used for bad. For example, what if a crime is commited and there is a high speed chase, since theres driveless cars they might get away but using the driveless car. I personaly think that cas should never become driveless because of the fact that the drivers would'nt take the blame for any actions that may occur with or in the driveless car. Cars should be driven manually so the car can be control by human not by computer. Plus if something was to go wrong with the driveless car it would cost more to repair the driveless car, but not as much for a regular car. In conclusion cars should not be driveless for many different reasons, and cars should be driven by human not computer nor robot."
17535,0,"In this article that I am writting I am against driverless cars. There no way the car would be able to deal with recks like humans are taught too. If the car was driverless im assuming its electrial so what if it rains and the water messes up the car while its driving? the car would malfunction and put the life of the people in the car in danger. The cars may not be able to be trust worthy on the streets either. What if the traffic light changes in the middle of the road and the car is programed to stop, while the other cars go. These are just some sutiations indicating that driverless cars are not safe and shouldn't be used. In the passage it staes that the car is required to alert the human when its skills are needed to work around construction and accidents. Therefore the driver must be alert at all times and if thats the case they might as well and put it on cruse and forgot about the "" driverless cars "". It also states in the passage that the necessitates the car being quickly get the drverd atten whenever a promblem occurs. This could be a huge promblem because on the tv we have in cars now a days. Plus texting and driving is a huge issue. They migth be in the middle of a text and the car just stops waiting fro the driver to figure out whats happening. The passage also states that Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. As a result in most states it is illegal even to test computer driven cars. The most important question is what if there is an accident. Whose fault would it be? So in coulsion i feel the driverless cars are not safe and should not be use."
21936,0,"Limiting car usuage will give us many benefits. A projects such as Vauban and BOGOTA were completed to show us the multitude of advantages recieved from it. Reducing car usuage would be excellent for our enviorment. Research shows us that ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenshouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States""(Rosenthal). Our world is very materialistic and sometimes we forget that to even have life, we must have the enviorment. ""Cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities""(Rosenthal). Therefore, limiting the amount of cars would allow us to have more efficent green houses, and more land area for plants. Money is also a huge factor here. The government spends hundreds of thousands of dollars each year in the transportation department. By lowering the number of cars on the road, the less wear and tear is done to them. This would be beneficial in many departements because then we would have more money for the things we need but cannot afford in our area and or country. Infact, ""80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transportation""(Rosenthal). Driving also causes stress. Traffic jams, new or confusing road signs, attitudes of passengers, are all distributions of stress, especially when you get lost! If the amount of driving we did by ourselves was cut back, we could also cut back stress. BOGOTA helps to prove this, and even says that violaters of no car day were ""fined $25(Selsky). Lastly, if we do not put a stop to so much driving, our personal health may be in risk. According to souce 4, ""the car industry is the second largest in the world."" This means that the air is constantly being pulluted with exhuast. Which also means that what's in your lungs at this very moment, could be a lot more than just oxygen. It's very scary to think that the same chemicals it takes to run your car, might just be what's floating around in your body. This could lead to multiple health problems and future diseases. Therefore, this issue needs to be taken control of immediately. In conclusion, reducing car usuage would be an amazing thing to do for oursleves and the people around us. We would save our air and bodies from being polluted, we would save money, and save time not stressing out. Who doesn't want these things? Limiting car usuage would be a fantastic idea."
23449,0,"Dear State Senator of Florida, I believe that we should keep the Electoral College. The Electoral College has been a huge part of America since our founding fathers, who established this process. This process helps keep America in order in and in line. Where would our country be without it? We would be lost and confused with no direction to follow. The Electoral College helps keep America's voting process organized, which is key to a well functioning country. Which is why I believe that we should absolutley keep the Electoral College so that our voting process stays organized and because it has kept our country functioning since the very beginning. I believe we should keep the Electoral College because it has kept our country functioning since the very beginning. Our founding fathers were the ones the establish the Electoral College which means it has been around since the beginning of our country. We should not change this tradition of America because it has seemed to kept us running smoothly for this long so why would we want to change that for no reason? If we stopped this tradition and changed it to all popular vote from citizens we would be hurting America in a huge way. It would completely change our ways of thinking, living, and running of America. Yes, a lot has changed in America since our founding fathers and yes change is sometimes for the better in our country because things are obviously different now then what they were 200 years ago but change would not be for the better in this situation. Let's say your grandmother, Mr. Senator, has had a peach cobbler recipe in your family for ages and it just takes your breath away with all the flavor and its divine taste, but this recipe is very old. If your grandmother's old recipe taste so delicious you would not want to change one thing about that recipe. Well same with the Electoral College. Its extremely old but it has also kept our country running well and has not failed us yet so we should not change this process just like you would not want to change your grandmothers peach cobbler recipe. This is why I think we should keep the Electoral College because it has kept us going since the beginning and you do not change something just because it is old or thought of being outdated. Voting for someone to be the head and leader of an organization is an extremely big deal, especially when that organization is a country with laws, citizens, and many other important topics. America needs to have a president willing to stand up for what is right, be there for his people, and run America in a smooth and organized fashion. If the elections were based upon popular vote then imagine what could happen, someone running for president could act like a person who is willing to take on the huge responsibility and stand up for what is right, but when everyone votes for him and they get into office then they turn into a total coward and someone not determined enough to take on the responsibility or take on America. With Electoral College those running for president are also being voted on by Congress and qualified citizens. This makes things run much more smoothly because citizens are still getting to put there two cents in but only if they are qualified which is much more reasonable. Citizens are a huge part of America, they have a lot to do with America running smoothly or not, which is why they should have a say in who runs their country, but no so much of a say that its unorganized and completely on their own opinion. I mean lets face it, us citizens have our flaws and dont always make the best decisions or have the best opinions. Having qualified citizens voting and Congress members voting make it much more understandable. Most Congress members will have been in Office for a very long time which makes them wiser and better to understand the whole voting process, the way America runs, and laws. Most will be able to pick out the better qualities for president out of each of the members running for president. This is why I belive we should keep the Electoral College because it keeps voting organized. The Electoral College is what keeps our voting process in order. When something gets old you do not throw it away if it still is of good use for you and the Electoral College is definetly still in good shape and is doing our country well so we should not change it because it has kept our country functioning from the beginning and so our voting process stays organized. Sincerely, a fan of the Electoral College"

They are proably thinking no human can do that because it is in outer space. The only other form of life that we have heard stories about living in outer space is aliens! The only problem with that is aliens dont exsist. So if aliens dont exsist then therefore this means that aliens have not had anything to do with this face on mars. So now what explanation do we have for the face being there? Well we know its not made by any type of form of life. So is it possible that maybe it just came natural? The picture might have apeared after a dust storm. the camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face, so since there where clouds that the camera had to get through maybe the clouds or storm or what ever formed the clouds may have caused it. When they snappred another picture clearer then the original one,they posted the picture on a jpl website showing that it was a natural landform.So that means that what ever caused the face was natural. witch means no aliens! People tried to say maybe the alien markings were hidden but i dont think so.the picture shows messa landforms common around american west. If its found on earth that means in concusion its definelty a natural landform."

In our solar system, and Also often referred to as Earth's twin. Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds, and also Because Venus is sometimes right around the corner in space terms humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped wold. First, In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" say that planet Venus, sometimes called the ""Evening star,"" is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot. Also the Venus have a nickname that is misleading since Venus is actually a planet, In our solar system. But Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earht, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. Secondly, The National Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA) they want send humans for studying Venus. But the NASA say have the solution for studying Venus and the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray. And the NASA say imagine a blimp like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above teh roiling Venusian landscape. Lastly, However Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide, but because most forms of light cannot penetrate teh dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective.

7538,0,"The new technology ""Facial Acting Coding System"" or FACS, would not be useful in a classroom enviroment today, the creator Eckman has this new technology set up with 6 main emotions; Happiness, Surprise, Anger, Fear, Sadness and Discust. The idea could be great for classroom use, but the way I feel that it would be exicuted seems ike a viloation of privacy and an unecissary cost to schools. In the article it is said that the FACS technology could be used in a classroom setting, it could tell if a student was bored or confused to possibly change the lesson to be more interesting. This seems that it could also be an evasion of this students privacy. If they are really sad becuase of home problems or other things, the student may not want the program or the teacher to know about it. With this type of software you could really evaide someones privacy and there personal thoughts. The article also says that a home computer can not compute the algorythims that this program is running, does that mean the school is going to have to get a ""super computer"" just to know if a student finds a topic in school intresting. I feel that the cost all together is not worth it, becuase why would someone who has spent so much time and money on the technology give it away for free. It seems like a lot of work for Eckman to give it out for free, even if it were to better education. One other problem with this FACS technology is how accurate is it, could a student fake a emotion just to not learn a new subject that is hard. I'm sure that most people can fake an emotion to get something, a lot of people when they were children have faked an emotion to get something, weather that was candy or a new toy. Most people have done it, wether or not you have. I do not feel that there is need for a program like this to be put into schools, if this program were to be put into advertising then it would be very profitable. But in a class room situation it is not needed at all, there is really no value to have this in our classrooms with all of the questions that we still have about it, along with the technology not being 100 percent accurate."

But now nasa has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study venus. And nasa is finding a possible solution to the hostile condition on the surface of venus would allow scientsts to float above the fray. but now get more information about venus. Now we talking about getting up to venus but not thinking about the temperatures would rise at around 170 degrees farhrenheit. The air pressure would be close to that of sea level on earth and solar power would be plentiful and radiation and would not exceed earth levels that the dangers part about getting to venus. however peering at venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limitedinsight on ground condition because most forms of light canot penetrate the dense atmosphere rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. More importantly. Reseachers cannot take samples of rock gas or anyhing else from a distance therefore scientists seeking to conduct a throught mission to understand venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks.
8600,0,"No, I dont think that using a facial coding system on your computers would be usefull or we wouldnt need it in a classroom. The only reason that could be useful would maybe be for a lab or in a phycology class. They wouldnt come to any use in a classroom because most kids in a class dont show much emotion. the process would take a while to do in a classroom also because it has to take a 3-D model of your face and makes all 44 major muscles in your face to determine if your happy, sad, anger, stressed, disgusted, etc. The Facial Action Coding Sytem can detect your emotions even when you are trying to hide them, The software weighs the diffrent units in a face or in a painting or a picture. People can perform this same type of research just by looking at a person or a friend. But the software can get every emotion just by looking at the persons muscles. The software can also pick up if a person is putting on a fake smile because of the muscles and there facial expression. According to the Facial Feedback Theory of emotion if you dont put a fake smile on and actually smile this could help produce these emotions. Some drama club teachers use a technique that helps the emotions look more realistic. The drama coach makes the actors or performers smile then frown so it helps them produce this emotion faster and more realistic.This helps the crowd with the emotions because people often imitate other peoples facial expressions unconsiously. But this could be a huge step for the science of emotions."

20335,0,"Unmasking the Face on Mars has always been an argumentive topic for us scientists and the conspiracy theorists. Is it just a naturally forming landform? Was it created by aliens? No one knows for sure but from our research, it is very unlikely that aliens could have assembled it. Us scientists here at NASA take our jobs very seriously. We research the outside world for a living and theorists are just taking guesses! Would you rather believe a NASA scientist or a conspiracy theorist's hypothesis of space? As humans, we always choose the craziest scenarios and we assume the worst. It could be something as simple as a landform for all we know. There is no proof of aliens but there is proof of landforms forming naturally. Yes, the ""face"" looks like it was made to look that way and yes it is oddly accurate to the face of an egyptian pharoh but this could just be a coincidence. We have very high tech cameras that shoot pictures of mars all the time. The ""best"" picture of the face from 1796 was taken by a camera with 43 meters per pixel. In 2001, we used a camera with 1.56 meters in each pixel so if there were so called ""aliens"" that assembled the face, they would have been captured in the shot as well. As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. What the picture shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, which are landforms common around the American West. People sometimes say it reminds them most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Another thing that makes the idea of it being a landform likely is that Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho is a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa which is about the same height as the Face on Mars so they are both very similar to eachother. There are a lot of ideas about what the Face could be. We will continue research and further our studies. Until then, believe as you wish but remember, scientists or theorists?"
3379,0,"The authors suggestion about studying Venus is a worthy despite of the dangers it presents. Exporing Venus wouldn't be too bad regardless of the dangers it presents. The author tells us good reasons why it wouldn't hurt to explore Venus. ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also becuase human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors"". This shows us that if we took the time to go and explore Venus we weould be overcoming a challenge we never thought we would have to. Also it helps us see that us as humans going and exploring we'd get our curiosity answered ike questions we have about Venus for example, How does it look?, How are temperatures different there than in Earth?, How is it different from Earth, and etc. Another reason is, If we think about it Venus is kind of our nearest option. In the article the author says,""Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit"". This shows us that Venus is the planet that is closer to us and we could have a higher chance to visit it. Also it helps us know that with it being the closest planet for us to visit we can go learn about it and overcome the fear and just go and enjoy it, which if you don't you'll just be having questions about Venus. Lastly, Just like how we go and travel we shoud go and explore Venus you wouldn't really spend much like you would when you travel and buy yourself a lot of things. In the article the author tells us ""Our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the edges of imagination and innovation"". The author is telling us that we shoud just go and travel leave our fears behind being scared to go and explore Venus shouldn't scare us, We should just overcome the fear because if we don't go we're not going to know exaclty how venus looks we're just going to imagine how it looks. Also the doubts shouldn't stop us from going the main doubts people would have would probably be like would I get there safe? and would I get back safe? those doubts shouldn't stop us as long as you know you over came your fear and went should make you proud. In conclusion, The authors suggestion that studying Venus is worthy despite the dangers it presents is a good idea. Due to the reaosns I talked about that the author supported in the article. Overcoming your fears is something we face in life eveyday so why not make exploring Venus one."

In the article Making Mona Lisa Smile by Nick D'Alto he says in paragraph 6 "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr Huang predicts Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" leading to that if a person gets out of track or gets bored the technology will pick up his or her face emotion. This leading to if the person gets bored then it makes the lesson a little more intresting. Also if a person gets confused about the lesson that they are on then the person that needs help can get the help without asking and making the person undertstand what they are doing all because the emotion technology will pick up that they are confused and need help. In conclusion that is some reasons why we should have the new technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. That way if students need help then they can get it without them even asking because the technology will already know that the student needs help or is bored."

One example of this is the developement of the diverless cars. For years many creative people have always dream of making this real to help humans' enviorment, transportation, and safetyness. If this developement of these driverless cars is to help humans improve their lives than the developement should countinue. If people are going to invent something that helps the humans they must as well invent something that helps the enviorment. In todays world we know that there is a lot of chemicals in the air and that many of us are affected. Actually everyone is affected be it. If the amount of gas is reduce in half and maybe we can safe todays' world. Wiht the reducement of contamination in the air the more safer is the air for humans to be able to breath it in. In today's world transportation is assensional in our lives. Because today's society has made humans move and have faster lives than a human that lived in the 1700s would have we depend more on cars or anything that has four wheels and a motor. Just image being in New York City and not being able to get a taxi or always arriving late to imortant meetings. In this kind of problems the diverless cars are able to fix this since they offer far more flexibility than a bus and finally you are able to get to place on time without a problem. The most important goal of creating the diverless cars is for the safety of humans. As the years pass people have created sensors. Sensors can causes the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce the power from the engine of the car, allowing far better response and control than and human driver could mange alone. But this is not the end of senors. People have made futher improvements on them and computer hardware and software to make sure to make driving safer also leading to cars that handle more and more tasks on their own. Eventhough the invention of the drverless cars has a long way to be completed the difficulties are not going to be an obsticle for the people who want to see this dream become real. In conclusion the development of the diverless cars can be a positive outcome on the enviorment, transportation, and human safety."

Vauban, Germany; Paris, France; Bogota, Colombia; Cali Colombia; and Valledupar Colombia. This day ended with positive results. For starters, the residents in Vaulban, Germany have given up their cars. Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbudden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg. Vauban's streets are completely ""car free""--except the main thoroughfare. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park--large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for forty thousand dollars, along with a home. As a result, seventy percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and fifty seven percent sold their cars just to move here. In the passage, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and a mother of two, she quotes,"" When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Additionally, Cars are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai ten to make their homes. Experts say that that is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emmissions from tailpipes. Passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to fifty percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. Futhermore, after days of near-record pollution, Paris, France enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, states that congestion was down sixty percent in the capital of France, after just five days of intensifying smog. So, in summation, there are some advantages of limiting car usage. By limiting car usage, you're also limiting pollution, carbon emissions, greenhouse gas emissions, etc."

UNRRA hired the ""Seagoing Cowboys "" Luke and Don Had to report to New Orleans by August 1945. They arrived on August 14 to go to Greece. Luke turned 18 before arriving to greece. He was nervous because, he could be forced to serve in the military. Unlike the other Seagoing cowboys he has been on nine trips, she doesn't want to losose hids job. For a small-town boy, taking these unbelivable is amazing. Luke had the chance to go to China, Europe, Crete, and ect. Luke Bomberger crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people after world war 2."
24549,0,"dear state senator, im writting this letter to you so you consider changing to election by popular vote for the prsident of the united states instead of electoral college. i belive like branford plumer, that the electoral college is very wrong not only because under the electoral college system, voters dont vote for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. but also because it is very unfair to voters, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. the electoral college is outdated, unfair, and irrational and its time for a change. nevertheless the electoral colleges dispute over its outcome is possible, it also nrequires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, its winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes does induce the candidates, the electoral college also restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-appotionment of the senate decreed on the constition, and it avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. the electoral college method of selecting the president is and will turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. according to the gallup poll in 2000, 60 precent of voters would prefer a direct election the electoral college is losing the little defenders it has and due to the spurious arguments the electoral college should be abolished."
16684,0,"I am against the manufactors creating ""Driverless cars"" First, I would like to say that the idea of creating a driverless cars are no smart. Just think of all the crashes and different problems of having this car can causes. The cars are made for people to drive to get from one point to another point. The point of making a driverless car is pointless. If manufactors made a driverless are then the questions come about ""WHY ARE THERE HUMANS?"" People are made to use things that are made but, if we have a driverless ca then humans dont need to be around anymore to drive them. The idea of a driverless car is pointless. So as young adult and as a American citizen Believe that we should not have driverless cars. Another reason why we should have driverless cars because if we have them, what would the human place be in the car. If these cars are made then we as the people would have room to text, eat, sleep, and do a million other things while the car drives itself. Which is a bad thing. Lastly, if we create these cars then the laws of the land would have to change. Traffic laws would have to change now because we have driverless and drivers on the road. We would have to change a lot ofthis cars were created. That is why I am against having these driverless cars."
2797,0,Scientists wants to keep on exploring venus even tho it is dangerous. One reason I think they should is because they should get information about things they brealy know about. My second reason is because they might find someuseful things if they keep on studing it. My last reason is because it might not be as dangerous as people make it out to be. These are some reason why scientist should keep studing venus. In addition I do think that the scientist should keep studying venus for some of these reasons. Reason one is because of the information that they can find id they keep looking into it. My second reason is that they might find some useful information if they keep studing the plant. My last reason is because it might not turn out to be a dangerous place as people say it is. In conclusion I do think its a good idea for people to keep studing venus. My first reason was because it could give the scientist more information on the plant. My second reason was they might find some useful information that coild help them. My last reason was venus might not be a dangerous place as people make it out to be. So i think this is why some scientist should study venus more.
18316,0,"Ever scence the invintion of cars people have been making advancements and modifications all to revolutionize them and make them better than the last model. Well what if I told you that the next model you buy might even drive itself? With todays technology self driving cars are no longer just the fantasy of a persons imagination. Self driving cars exist right now in fact google has had self driving cars scence 2009. Don't get the wrong idea however, the self driving cars have a ways to go before they hit the streets of America. Cars that drive without the use of humans will have a much bigger impact than just not having to remotly drive it. A resurcher named Sergey Brin envisions a future with fleets of self driving cars transporting the public. Humans will no longer need to buy cars wich could save a lot of money for ordanary people who dont have alot of it. With less human driven cars Sergey foresees that the fuel used will be half of what is used today. That will have a huge impact on our environment and natural resources. Having to import less fuel means that America can spend that big chunk of money some were else. The self driving cars of the future will be equiped with the latiest and greatiest technology. Todays cars already have radars that can stop your car from backing up into an object or even emergancy stop for you. Motion sensors can now beam lasers that form a constantly updating 3D model of the cars surroundings. A self driving car could use those 3D images to know when there is on coming trafic, See road blocks up ahead and even stop if a deer were to run out into the road. Some people do not like the idea of a self driving car because it takes the controle out of there own hands. The Self driving cars that are currantly in use right now still give the driver controle over the vehicle. The cars even need some human help. The cars have been equiped to tell the driver to take over when human help is requred. Some cars will have a vibrating seat or flash light on the wind shield, or the car might even just tell you to take over. Over all a self driving car in my opinion would be a helpfull thing. Once all the bugs are worked out and proper laws are made total human controled cars will be a thing of the past."
2444,0,"Venus is one of the planets that have the same density and size and used to have mountains,valleys,craters and it also used to have oceans which means it used to have life but the pressure will kill us because the pressure is 90 times stronger than ours. It is hard to go to venus because sometimes we are farther and sometimes we are closer to venus. All of our space missions to venus have been unmaned because no spacescrafts hasnt survivded the landing longer than a few hours. on the planets surface the atmodspheric pressure is 90 time than on our own planet. venus used to be covered with oceans and had valleys. mountains and craters. NASA want to send people to study venus. a vehicle would be needed to hover across venus surface. systems made by mechanical devices will by crushed by the pressure. So the exploration of venus will be difficult but we will soon need a planet because once we run out of material we wont be able to go anywhere."
1105,0,"The author supports this idea of ''The Challenge of Exploring Venus '' by stating many facts by In paragraph 3 it states that ''A thick atmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankets venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface tempatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit,and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we are accustomed to on earth. such an enviorment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquify many metals. Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes,powerful earthquakes,and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on it's surface. The main reason i used the following text was to support my point of view of why we do not go to venus. For example we do not go to venus because of the heat,carbondioxide,and the facors of the planet so in conclusion, i think it is important that we should be smart about this and only hoover above the surface. because of the factors of venus."
10015,0,"The idea of driverless cars is a great idea humans have been thinking about driverless cars for a while now so why make them wait even longer. Think about wanting to go out somewhere or do something you don't have drive you don't have to pay for gas you just pay the cab fee and take your ride where ever you want to. If you go to a bar you don't have to worry about people driving under the influence and a lot of car crashes or deaths because of people driving under the influence. Driverless cars are a good thing when you are in traffic or say rush hour and you're waiting everyone's going slow and you take your eyes off the road the cars still moving when it approaches another car or wall it will brake the brakes will lock them selfs. Some driverless cars have other special features about them some have vibrating seats so when you're about to wreck the car vibrates and let's you know that you need to pay attention and take control of the situation. And if we don't at least give driverless cars a chance we will never know how good and useable they can be. Driverless cars can be just the thing we need for teenagers who can't drive or they're just beginning to learn how to drive it can help them get places safe and sound without any accidents or injuries we could become a great world, a great country just by becoming safer."

Let me tell you why everyone should join the UNRRA's seagoing cowboy program First and for most, it is very fun. We play all the average games like baseball, volleyball, table tennis, fencing, boxing and ready. Another way we have fun is with the animals. Watching the baby horses play is adorable. Last but not least my friends and I have fun. We tell jokes and play pranks. You know the usual guy stuff. This program teaches responsiblity. I am in charge of the animals and I have to feed and water them 3 times everyday and clean their stalls once a week. It may not sound fun but it is worth it when you see the light in peoples eyes when they recive one of our animals. As well as responiblity you get certain rewards. On my free time I like to see the awesome structures that the people have in their cities. In total I have gotten one gondola ride, 2 trips to Acropolis and 1 trip to the Panema Canal. These are only the three top reasons why everyone should join this program. and if you are interested the UNRRA always needs new people!"
2686,0,"VENUS Just because Venus is the second planet there is so much to figure out on it but Venus is a very delicate planet. The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because Venus is the second planet to the sun. Also Venus is actually a planet but its called the evening star. Venus has the hottest surface tempature of any planet in our solar system even though mercury is closer. Venus has a high pressure and high heat. Scientists and astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been earth like planet in our solar system. But even though the planet Venus can sometimes be our option for a planet visit but the value in returning to Venus is indisputable.Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. In conclusion, NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus. Some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber of chaos. But Venus has value by striving to meet the challenge because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself. The travels earth and beyond should not limit by dangers and the doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."
15643,0,"Despite the fact that driveless cars aren't completely driveless they are a wonderful. The idea of a car that can drive its self under normal road conditions amazing. These cars could hep many people out who have impaired vison or our senor citizen population. They have no crashes so far and they are reliable means of transportation. The even more amazing thing is that they alert the human driver when dealing with complicated trafic or dealing with driveways, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents. ""The car can handel driving speed up to 25 mph, but speacial touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel the wheel, states the passage. This mean that the car will not move if the drives hands moves off of it this makes sure the drivers stay alert in case harsh road ways occur. Google modified a Toyota Prius with a whole lot of sensors, this is so a driveless car can mimic what real drivers do. Driveless care could be the new trend of america. These cars have shown astonishng growth over time.They are made to mimic human driving and alert the real driver when road conditionds get to rough. Even though they are not completely driveless the idea of a car that can drive you around with out any help (if road conditions allow) it a very amazing discovery."
22292,0,"Fellow citizens, I would like to talk about the advantages to the incipient idea of limited car usage. Limited car usage is the limitation of cars used in a certain area, however, the limitations all depends on the area. Some places in the world completely ban cars, in which you would need to pay a fine in order to even keep your car, much less drive it. Other places simply have limitations on a particular day(s), in whish on those days if you drive a car you may or may not be fined. The main advantage of limited car usage, is that it can reduce pollution in an area. Also limited car usage, although not obvious, can also help reduce car crashes. If there is one major problem in the world that has yet to be solved, it is the amount of pollution, smog, and greenhouse gases that has accumilated throughout the Earth; limited car usage, however, can help reduce that problem. According to Robert Duffer, Paris enforced a partial driving ban when days of near-record pollution occured. ""[Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.....The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday"" (Duffer). Also in Bogota, Colombia, they have car-free days which help reduce air pollution. ""' It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,' said buisinessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife."" (Selsky). Also, citizins of limited car usage areas do not seem to mind and even enjoy not having a car, for example Heidrun Walter from Vauban, Germany, states ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" (Rosenthal). As shown by evidence, citizens agree that limited car usage not only helps the place's overall environment but also the Earth's environment, and some citizens of limited car usage areas do not even seem to mind it. In addition, limited car usage can also reduce fatal car crashes. Although this second advantage is not as major as the first, in some perspectives, it is still important. Limited car usage seems to be linked to less people driving, as I infered by this evidence ""There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license.....A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009"" (Rosenthal). With less people driving less fatal car crashes are bound to happen due to the fact that less people are driving. Although I may not be right, I feel as though two or more people bumping into each other while walking is not nearly as fatal as two or more cars 'bumping' into each other. In total, although limited car usage may not seem to have many advantages, the few that it does have are detramental. Limited car usage has the advantages of not only helping the environment, but also helping or maybe even saving citizens from fatal car crashes throughout the world."
9728,0,"In the passage, “Unmasking the Face on Mars”, you read of two different veiws on how the “Face” came to be. On one hand, there is the arguemnt that the “face” is proof of life on Mars. NASA sees it in a different light. People which work in science feilds invollving landformations believe the “face” was made from natural causes. In NASA, it is mostly believed that the “face” they've come across has much to do with landformation. On Mars, and other planets, there are always different indentions and craters left on the surface which creates landforms. Now look in the passage at the section it talks about the images of the formation. There are three different pictures of the “face” all in different years and different qulities of the cameras. The first picture shows a clear image that looks exactly like a face, compare that to the second image and perhaps you'll notice how much more the “face” is shadowed than that of the first. After comparing the two, take a glance at the third picture taken in 2001. In the last picture you may see an even bigger difference than that of the first image. It is a very clear picture, regarding the knowledgeable observation that the face can be a part of land formed by a natural cause and which also has that of a shadow of a human face. Also, later explained in the passage in section 12, is of how simular the landform is to that of some here on Earth created by lava. At first, it was very difficult to get a nice clear picture due to the weather on Mars at that time the third picture was taken ment to be taken. The team did not give up however! Stated from the passage here- “It’s not easy to target Cydonia,” says Garvin. “In fact, it’s hard work.”... “We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view,” said Garvin. “Malin’s team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera’s absolute maximum resolution.”- the team worked hard so all people could see the face in clear sight. Refelcting on just how popular the whole idea of an actual face being on Mars and comparing that to the thought of landformation, the passage gives good insight into how NASA has a strong argument in the case along side the case of live on Mars."
723,0,"In this article the author did a great job at explaining why we should still try to study Venus. Although there are many challenges NASA is trying to overcome, the author inlcuded details about the geology, weather, and what kind of technology we could use on Venus. As stated in this article Venus is the most ""Earth like"" planet, meaning that Earth and Venus are ver similar. They both that a rocky sediment that eventually forms valleys, mountains, and even craters. Scientists assume that long ago Venus was actually mostly covered in water too, which would have made it possible for organisms to grow there. Venus is also one of the closest planets to us - besides Mars, that would make it easy to send things such as rovers to explore it. But there are some things about Venus that aren't so Earth like and would make it difficult to explore. The author also explained in paragraph 3 that if NASA were to send something to Venus there is no way it would survive the trecherous weather conditions. There is a thick atmosphere made up of blankets of carbon dioxide and under are currosive sulfuric acid clouds. Since the atmosphere and clouds are so thick it makes it hard to even see in the first place. Not to mention all of the volcanoes, earthquakes, and lightining that would destroy anything we sent up there. It is also said that Venus has the hottest temperature of all the planets in our solar system resting at a whopping 800 degrees, which would melt almost any piece of technology we sent there. In paragraph 7 the author talks about how NASA is looking at different approaches to visiting Venus, or sending technology out there. NASA has tested simplified electronics made of silicon carbide in a chamber that simulates what it would be like on Venus and they lasted up to three weeks. But some think that if they were to use an old piece of technology from the 1800's that it could possibly work as well. That piece of techology is called the mechianical computer, which actually uses no technology at all, it uses gears and levers to calculate things. But overall NASA would need to be careful due to the fact that it is 800 degrees on Venus and that could melt several different things. In short, the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" did a great job supporting why people should not give up studying Venus. They provided solid evidence of why our two planets are similar, weather conditions that would hold us back, and technology we could potentially use to explore Venus."
14237,0,"I believe the Face On Mars is just a natural landfrom because if there was life on Mars, why would we have yet to see the aliens on Mars? Years ago, on May 24,2001- Nasa sent Viking 1 to orbit around Mars looking for possible landing sites of its sister ship Viking 2 when i had seen something unusally on the surface of Mars, the landform form on Mars had the shadowy likeness of a human face. When the picture of the face had got sent to the lab back down the on Earth the sensation was short lived by scientist who figured it was just another Martian mesa. The face on Mars couldn't be created by aliens because we would've had contact with aliens a long time ago.Scientist figured it could've been the formation of mesa because Mars has no planet life nor water life for anything to live on it.With the the recent pictures studies has shown that there was no alien marking on the face to show that aliens are on Mars. The face on Mars had the resemblance of a human head formed by illusion showing the mouth,nose, and eyes. After showing the world one picture they wanted to see an up close picture they later toke another picture revealing it as a natural land form which there was no alien monument after all. It was stated in the article by an person that the land form"" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says the man by the name of Gavin. ""That's a lava dome that the fotm of an isolayed mese about the same height as th Face On Mars. In conclusion, I believe that the face on mars is in all actuallity just a land formation because since discovering the face there has been no more reappearences of any other momuments. There has been no contact with alien life"

I think that people that are in them would be much safer and the people out of them would be a little safer also. Now lets talk about the buisness parts. The money that will be made now i going to be awsome. I bet peope will have there normal cars. they would also have these cars also they would get so much money also. They do cost alot more but people would for sure pay the price for them. I know i would its just smart to. You would get way more out of it then you would get in to it. The law wouldnt have to worry as much either. They would know the street is safe with drivers when everything is computer. So much more can be proven too. If you get in to a wreck then you can prove what happens now and fix the problem also. These cars are just great. we would also have much smoother rides with a person not jerking the wheele. I think these cars are just great.

7661,0,"Emotions are things that gets projected everyday through facial expression. Sometimes those feelings overwhelm a person and it contributes onto life decisions they have to make. It plays a big role onto what they do next and how it is being done. But those facial expression projected can be used to help students in the classroom. Technology created to be used in order to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. It can contribute to the way a student is learning or if they're even learning at all. According Dr Huang, she predicted that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (D'Alto 1). Facial expressions can be used to identify how a person is feeling. So when the lesson is modified and changed due to a student becoming confused or bored then it can actually attract the student back into learning. This technology can raise the attentionative students give to the lessons if they're actually able to understand and enjoy being able to do so. The technology may not be able to decode different emotions. It states in the article that ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication... so computers need to understand that too"" (D'Alto 1). The way computers are programed isn't always accurate. This computer wiring can identify the wrong emotion causing the wrong modification onto the lesson. This can cause more confusion among the students causing them to disregard the whole purpose of the lesson. Although computers are not always 100% accurate all the time; it is still possible to be able to change that and create improvements. As you read ""Artist such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code"" (D'Alto 1). This provides proof onto how individuals can take what they do in real life and apply it into technology. Each day technology is improved due to mistakes that occur in the past. If mistakes don't occur then they won't know where to evolve. The improvement in this type of technology can be able to identify more expressions which can play a big role into the classroom enviorement. It can contribute into ways of hooking the student onto the lesson and actually keeping that attention there and no where else. Reading facial expression can be taken into technology to create an innovention to provide us with better learning and education. The way students learn by the education being provided is only valuable if there's contributing factors to help make it easier."
18589,0,"One hundred years ago inovators wouldn't have dreamed of inventing driverless cars. The very thought of an automobile being able to drive itself would have been a feet only the gods could do. In the twentieth century, though, technology has advanced more and more each day and that includes this mind boggling idea. Many would say that driverless cars are unsafe and would needlessly use up time and energy but the truth of the matter is, driverless cars are our doorway to another world of inventions that could not only benefit our daily lives but save others as well. Inovators around the globe agree that self-driving cars are, at least, a great accomplishment for humanity. Until 2009 cars, such as these, did not even exist; because of the brillant minds of many amazing inovators, we can now say that humans are one step closer to a new type of world that doesn't have to involve death because of irresponsible and reckless drivers. In the passage ""Driverless Car are Coming"" the author even states that ""The in-car system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big concern."" Of course the author is right, but what about all the sensors cars like these would come equipped with? Many say that these cars would lead to disaster and countless car accidents but, in fact, these cars are safer than any other we have seen before. Although we are not quite ready for driverless cars to be driven around town, inventions, such as these, are what make our civilization so unique. Self-driving cars are not only impressive because of how complicated they are, but the idea that someone could have to think that these cars could be made possible. Driverles cars are safe and might include back-up options in case something goes wrong and the driver needs to steer. Law-makers feel these automobiles cannot be safely driven around other individuals but they have obviously not looked into how able these cars actually are. These cars are what gives us a chance at other inventions that we cannot even fathom down the road. These automobiles are what will insure that our futures may be just a bit brighter because of these self-abled cars."

Driverless cars will put taxi divers, lemo drivers, delivery men and woman out of business because of the cars being driverless, many families will possibly struggle because their parent, guardian or even themselves will no longer have a job because of the driverless vehicle. People who actually enjoy their job, driving people to their destiny will be devistated because they no longer can do what they enjoy. The driverless cars will cause less motivation and may cause an alternate effect on the body. If driverless cars become something big, teens will no longer have the motivation to get good grades and study, some teens' motivation was from the fact that they'd be able to drive, drive and have their own vehicle. The driveless vehicle will be pointless to have, learning to drive is an achievement still to this day! Also, cars, driving will boost the human reflexes because of the concentration, with driverless cars, that concentration will lower and even cause the human reflexes to slow. The driverless cars idea is a waste of the people's money. Building a driverless car will cost more than it does to build a regular vehicle. The driverless cars will require heavy-duty sensors and more advanced technology; the technology would have to be built which will cost possibly millions and then the car being built WITH the technology will cost more. Driverless cars are not needed."
1288,0,"Why We Should Study Venus What is venus like on the surface? In this passage the author suggest that studying venus is worthy pursuit despite the danger it present.Their are risks when trying to study another planet.Their are also material on venus that is the same or earth years ago.Their are also benifit if we can sucessfuly studying venus such as blimp-like vehicle.We should study venus because of the benifit and the technology it can provide us. Risks, A thick atmostpher of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide cover Venus.On the surface of venus the temperture average over 800 degree fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on earth.Venus has the hottest surface in the solar system.In additional there are erupting volcanoes,powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning.Even more challenging is that it has the sulfuric acid in venu's atmosspher which makes entering the planet challenging for object to enter. Venus was a earth-like planet long ago.Venus was probaly covered in largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, like earth.Today, Venus still have some feature that are simlar to earth. The planet have features such as valleys, moubtains, and craters.There is also that venus can be sometime be our nearest option for a planetary visit. Their are some benifits such as having a blimp-like vehicle hovering over the roiling venusian landscape for scientists to study venus.Like our airplane could fly over storms, a vehicle hovering over venus would avoid the unfriendly gound condition by staying up and out of their way.The hovering vehicle can avoid danger.Howerver looking at venus from above in a hovering vehicle can provide only limited insight on ground condition because most form of light can not penetrate the dense atmospher.There are many researchers who are working on innovating machines to last longer on the surface on venus to study it.Venus has value, not because of all the gains we get from it but also from our human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Venus have a vary hot surface about 800 degree in fahrenheit. Their are also risks invloving this expadition such as atmospher pressure. Venus was like earth a long time ago, Today it still have many features like earth such as valley, mountains, and craters.Some benifits are that we could have a hovering vehicle over venus for sicentists to study it.The author supportes his idea really well saying why we should study venus."
2669,0,"In the article, the author implies the idea that studying Venus is a worthy endeavor despite its many dangers. By using examples, descriptive details, and more, the author supports this claim very well. The authors does many things in this article to show the relevant danger that the planet Venus presents. They did this by using factual information at the beginning of the article. For example, in paragraph 3, the author states that ""a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere"". This example show the evident danger that Venus holds. Another example of the author showing the dangers of Venus is the author states, ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit"". This being another example of how the author shows the dangers of Venus. Though, on the other hand, the author also gives the idea that Venus is worth exploring despite all of its dangers. One example being when the author says, ""astonomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Eath-like planet in our solar system"". This shows that the author believes that Venus is a worthy planet to be explored despite the danger it holds. Another example of how the author supports theri claim is that they used factual information in the article. An example of this is in paragraph 5,where the author states, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray...at thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans"". This is one of the many factual statements throughout the article that shows the support of the author's claim. The author also says this statement at the end of the article saying, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imaginations and innovation"". This shows that the author also believes that Venus is worth exploring because they give their own opinion about the future expeditions of man and how they should forever expand exploration. In conclusion, the author support their claim that Venus should be explore despite its evident dangers by using factual information, personal opinions, and descriptive details about the exploration of Venus, showing that they believe it should be explored because of the challenges it presents."
686,0,"Space exploration is a growing topic. NASA has sent rovers to Mars and landed people on the moon but they cannot seem to figure Venus out. The author of this article titled ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" has explained why Venus is such a hard planet for space explorers very well. Venus could have been a planet just like Earth, according to the author. The author of the article first hits the readers with information about Venus and compares it to the planet we live on. If Venus is so close to being Earth's twin then why is it challenging to explore it? In the third paragraph the author states, ""On the planet's surface [Venus], the temperatures average 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. "" These facts are on of many reasons as to why Venus is challenging to explore. NASA is looking into these invention or solutions that need to be addressed to even have a chance at making to Venus. The author said that there are things that could be done to help us get to Venus' surface but it is not around yet, which is another reason it is challenging to explore Venus. We cannot succsessfully make it there yet. Venus is dangerous. From what space explorers can tell the planet can be similaer to Earth or was similar to Earth. The author says, ""... peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective,"" this means that touching down on Venus'surface isour best chance on discovering what might have been living on Venus or what may possible show up. NASA has been trying to find other life or signs of life for many years and the planet that finally may show signs of possible life they're unable to reach. The author has presented may facts and statistics within this article. They brought up the fact that space explorers cannot reach the planet/reach the planet and survive, how it is different from Earth, and why NASA wants answers to the questions they have on Venus."

So that you can save engery because it's a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. Since world war 2 our development has been depending on centered car and it need to change,because people depends on having cars,and i've to say what about your health? When you relie on things like that you'll think you dont need to walk to where your going or you to fancy or high class to ride a bus or even ride in a cab. Then maybe the roads won't be so busy after all. Also which would help with our air pollution. So what do you say get up and lets get moving and have a car free day! what do you say? Cause I'll think it's an wonderful idea so you can get out and enjoy the air! Long been of the world's prime car cultures because America's love affair with its vehicles which makes transportation the second largest source of America's emissions just behind the power plants. This is why i wanted to inform everyone in the U.S to try at least have one full day when you dont use your car you catch a bus,cab or n train to make our life,town and comminutie a better place."
17702,0,"Driverless Cars i first heard of on the news 6 years ago in 2010. I was alittle kid, around the age of 10 or 11 so it quickly caught my attetion. 'Cars that could drive without mom i thought'. So that could mean on are trips to Chicago to see are cousins we could all watch a movie, instead of me, my brother and sister. But as i got older and studied more i relized that cars that could drive themselves were not exaclty coming to the public as quick as the creators talked about them. Shortly after the beggining of the article the author tells about Google cars that drive independently under specific conditons since 2009. So whats the problem since they can drive by themselves. A main stance that is repeted in the article is that what will happen when road constuction happen, other drivers on the road and accidents. I gurantee most people driving dont wake up and say, before i go to work im going to have a car crash. Thats a big step they have to figure out before they ask lawmakers to change the laws of self driving vehicles. Fault is a big concern in this matter as well. Lets look 10 years into the future, you just got your tax return and your looking into buying a self driving car. So after a week you say, 'hey, this could really be usefull'. And you buy it. Weeks passbuy and one day you put it in selfdrive while you at a stop light to send a text. The light turns green and it begins to move alittle to faster than usaul, you look and know ones in front so you say everythings good, you look down to send the text and all of a sudden a car comes out of no where and crashes into you. The car is sposed to stop have sensors to tell it to stop when a another vehicle is near, but this time a malfuntion happens. Is it the car companies fault, this agurment can go extremely deeper than you think. But as i read the article my stance still stood on the exicitment of the fact that the car could drive its self. But I cant still ignore the possibal crashes that could happen. And the fact that the companies will try to say that they are not at fault for eny crashes that happen in with human control, or self driving control. But for now i would have to say that an incredibal amount of test shold take place, and driving certification centers know the specs of the vehicles."
18145,0,"Wouldn't you think that a driverless car would be nice? Well, driving a car would keep reckless drivers off the roads, prevent lots of accidents and save lots of fuel. This Google cofounder Sergey Brin, sees that the cars he envisions use half of the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibilty than a bus. Google has had cars that could drive indepently since 2009. These cars drove more than half a million miles without a crash. These cars are not completely driverless. You would still have to pull out of driveways and deal with heavy traffic problems. General Motors made a car that could run on a special test track. the track had an electrical cable that sent radio signals to a receiver on the front end of a car. Berkeley engineers used magnets with alternating polarity. The car read positive and negative polarity as messages in binary code. When putting something in called the dubbed LIDAR, which uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings, is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel. Applying sensors that can give information can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver manage alone. BMW created a car that can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, and are also all made to ntify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through the work zones and around accidents. This also means the human driver must stay alert and be prepared to take over the wheel when the situation occurs. In addition, the GM has developed driver's seats that vibrates when the car is in in danger of running into an object. Manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are focused on the road. So for instance, while the driver is paying attention to the road, the car is paying attention to the driver. In conclusion, I think all humans should look forward to purchasing driverless cars."
24038,0,"Cars have become an important part of our world. From their rising fame came consequences that effected our daily lives and our enviornment. Limiting car use can have advantages, like reducing greenhouse gasses and making ones community better to live in. By limiting car usage, the amount of greenhouse gasses- gasses produced by exaust, carbon dioxide, etc.- would be reduced. Greenhouse gasses effect the ozone layer of the earths atmosphere and that in turn effects the health of everyone breathing in the earths oxygen. Greenhouse gasses, albiet the healthy sounding name, is not good for people or the enviornment. By limiting car usage, people can put a dent in the amount of greenhouse gasses being produced. ""Passenger cars are responsible for for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"" This means people can change the world by simply reducing their car usage. Changing the way one lives can change the way they look at life. Some people in the community of Vauban have found happiness just by reducing their car usage. ""'When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.' said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two"" In this community people get to experience walking down the street, hearing people instead of the constant sound of a running car. ""In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway."" The people living in the community don't have to go out of their way to buy something when they can just walk down the street and purchase it. The town of Vauban entertains the choice of effeciency and health over inconvienence and unsafe air. Limiting car useage can have many advantages, like reducing greenhouse gasses and making one's community better. Although cars are convienent the people in the town of Vauban would rather live in a reduced car community."
5463,0,"Emotions can be expressed everyday, wether you are happy, surprized, angry, disgust, feard, and, sad, you still show some emotion. Now technology is improving and they now know the facial expression that the Mona Lisa is making. ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"" (Paragraph 1). The technology that was used to find it out was a technology called Facial Action Coding System or FACS. The technology should be used more in the future and it's a great technology that has been made in the years. Technology changes everytime, but facial recognition could be very usefull. Many people could use it to find people facial expression if they don't know their expression. With this technolog, you could find the students expression on something and could possibly help them with them. The technology can be very usefull. Students have sometimes trouble in class, but sometimes they are afraid to ask. The person who is using the technology could help them and know their feeling. They could easily get help from a person. The teacher could also play a big role when they use the technology. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" (Paragraph 6). What Dr. Huang said was that with this technology, teachers could change the lesson to be not boring. If the lesson is boring, the student who is bored would pay less attention to that class and probably fail, but if it was a class and he was more happy about it, he could memorize it and could not forget it and learn what he did in class. Another thing it can do is help from the confussion of the student. If the student is confused in class, the teacher could change and modify it for a simpler explanation. Then the student would understand it more and they would learn from it more easier. The FACS technology is very helpful and could help a lot of students. It even found the emocion expression of a famous art work draw by Leonardo da Vinci, the Mona Lisa. It solved something that is very old and knew it's expressions. Who wants their students to fail in a class? There is a simple fix, the FACS technology which could help the student pay more attention in class and get little or no borem at all."
2081,0,"The author supports his/her idea well with all the details they gave of the temperatures and conditions of Venus. Although it seems near impossible, the author leads one to believe that exploring Venus' surface may be more possible than it looks at first glance. There are metals that could survive such conditions. While floating 30 or so miles above the surface of the fireball-like planet might give us more insight than we already have, to really acquire significant information, we need to get right down on the ground. On the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit. While that may be hot enough to melt a chinsy-built little robot, the author makes a valid point that a system of steel gears and levers would be able to withstand such conditions for a long period of time. If we could send a mechanical-built robot down to explore, it might be able to survive on the surface of Venus long enough to collect some of the information we need. Perhaps a machine made out of tungsten, it'd be heavy, but the melting point would be significantly higher. In conclusion, the author makes many valid points that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers that come with the exploration of the planet. Harder metals with hotter melting points are obviously going to last longer. Even floating 30 or so miles above the surface in a space ship could potentially give us more information than we already have. If we have the resources to make landing and exploring our sister planet possible, why not get all the way on the ground and get as much information as possible though?"
5467,0,"Yes, I agree The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because you can read someone's emotions by the look on their face when they walk to the classroom. In the article,It refers ""you can probably tell how a friend is feeling by the look on her face"". An example in the article is refering ""A classroom computer could recongize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". Another example,""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive-for video games or video surgey. This is how the technology is vaulable to read someone's emotions. You can read a friend's emotions to tell how they are feeling. If you have a friend is forcing herself to smile, you can tell she is feeling sad, depressed, or angry. I know you can't read someone's mind to tell how are they feeling. Only you can read someone's emotion is by the computer knownig your are sad or happy. An example in the article, ""if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen,a similar ad might follow. But If you frown,the next ad will be different"". This is how computer tell emotions on that person. If your a teacher,when you see all the students in the classroom, they get tired,bored,confused,or excited. You see different emotions from students when they got to school this moring. Some of the students stay up to late and they woke up early this moring. half of the students in the classroom they might get bored and do not want to learn anything today. The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive-for video games or video surgey. In this modern technology,kids love to have their phone to play on their games like Iphones,samsungs,lg's phone,or more phones I can think about right now. There are alot of games(Apps) you can play on your smartphone like video games. There is a list of video games kids are so excited about like subway surfers, Archey,Basketball games and etc. This how kids in classrooms's love to have technology with them. This usefulness this technology to read someone's expressions of the students in a classroom is valuable. You can tell someone's feelings simply by the look on her face. In a classroom you can tell the students how they feel like confused or bored. the technology can be fun like playing games or looking at videos. This how you tell the technology is valuable inside in a clasroom."
9469,0,"I am against the making of Driverless cars. The reason I am against driverless cars, are because most people can not handle the cars they have to manually drive. A driveless car is another excuse for people to not focus on the road. Another reason I am against driverless cars, is because when its time to take your drivers test, you are not really learning how to drive, becasue you are depending on the car to do all the work. I am also against driverless car, because it will fustrate human, because they may not know when its there time to take over. In the passage,it stats that at some point we will have to take over. "" they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways, or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents"" The person who has the driverless car, may be doing something, and when its time for them to take over, they may not have time to catch the wheel, and they may end up having an accident. Thats why I am against the driverless cars. A driverless car, can affect the driver annd other passengers. The way it can affect those people, is if something goes wrong with the car, a passenger or the driver can get seriously injured. The car may have a manufactor problem, and the driver may not know what to do, and end up having a car accident. In the passage it stats ""If the technology fails, and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufactures."" Driving a car like this, you may not know who fault it is for the problems that goes on. We have to be carefull for the things we do.Thats why I am against the driverless cars. The safest way to drive a car is to get a car that a human may control at all times. If there ar no driverless car, there will be less problems manufactures will have, there will be less accidents, and less injured people. If everyone wil stick to a car that they have to control, thre will be less problems. If a person have to take there drivers test, and have a car they have to control, they will be most likely to past there test, and be able to get there license. If we stick to car we have o control, people will stay more focused on the road, then being focused on something other than that. If people stick to cars that they have to control, you will never have a problem finding out who fault was it that caused your injureie, or you passengers. If we are going to be driving we have think smarter, on whats best importnat. If your driving a driverles car, its not jusr affecting you, its affecting you, its also affecting the drivers, and padestrins around you. We have people whoare reckless drivers already, and if they get into contact with a driverless car there just going to have an excuse to be even more reckless, and thats what causes poeple to get hurt. Thats why i am strongly against driverless cars."
7786,0,"I have mixed emotions about this because on one hand it can be educational but, on the other hand it can be invasive. We could have this in classrooms for studying it could also, help us understand more than with just telling us emotion. It could help us in airports, with facial reconiction. But also at the same time you may be having a REALLY bad day and you have some emotions that you want to stay hidden. If this machine can pick those emotions up you would probably want to avoid it. We do the same thing every day but, we can't acually calculate what people are thinking. Just like how if someone is sad and drepressed but, has a face that looks happy people are going to assume that, that person is happy when really they aren't. Educationally it could help a person understand what mood setting there is in a picture or it could help people understand how a mood changes in a movie or in a book. Like I said in the begining I have mixed emotions about this so I don'treally no what else to say except for the goods and bads about the idea but, if I had t ochose between to publish or not to publish the machine to be duplicated. I would say yes because, it could help educationally and tecnologly."
6132,0,"Do you believe that a Facial Action Coding System or FACS is a good things and is accurate? Well I believe that this FACS could be a good thing and is accurate. I believe this because it is based on the computer being able to detect your emotions by your facial muscles. The computer will be able to know when a child is confused on the lesson, the computer will be able to see a person reaction to an ad if it is a good reaction then the computer will put more up like that or change it if you were not pleased, and this FACS will be able to make video games more realistic. This sounds like amazing opportunity to improve the way we do things in every day life. For starters, I believe FACS can be a great improvement in evey day life because of the computer being able to change the wording or assignment based on the childs facial expression. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored..then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This will help improve test scores because the computer was able to modify the lesson so the student can understand. This can also help determine if a stundent will pass or fail the class because majority of the time students fail a class because of test they were not able to pass. In addition, FACS could also be a good thing because it will help improve video games. I know what most of you may be thinking why would we want to improve video games so our kids or student could waste their time on the game instead of doing their homework or going to sleep early. This is not why it will be a good thing to improve a video game but it will be a good thing because it can help make a video or video game, surgery video, or be more realistic for games that have to deal with surgeries. ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive- for video games or video surgery,"" This could help improve the knowledge of a medical student or a high school student taking anatomy. Finally, For those of you that hate and like certain ads your in luck. With FACS you are able to see ads that please you rather then the one that makes you just want to break the computer screen. With the new FACS software you can change the ads with the two most simplest facial expression, such as you smile then the next ad you will see is something similar to the pervious ad. If you hate and ad your frown can change the ad to an ad completely different. "" For example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" this is a good thing because people would not mind ads as much and it might produce sales based on if the person like the product in the ad. In conclusion, Do you believe me now when i say t that the FACS software is a great improvement. I believe this because the computer will be able to change the lesson if the student is confused, it could change the ads based on two emotions, and making video games or surgery videos more realistic. I hope i persauded you to believe that FACS is a good thing for our everyday life."

This is showing that the dust could've been moved around to create this shadowy likeness. This could prove that there was no type of form of life on Mars. The camera on board the MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Aa a thumb rule, you could discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. This could mean that the camera overlooked the rock formation. Meaning it could have created an illusion or some thing of that sort. if the camera created a type of illusion than that could mean that the there is no form of life on Mars."

There are many different things that the humans just phiscally need to do and driving is one of them. The development of cars that can get you from point a to point b is already good enough. Most teenagers and adults like the thought of them being able to drive phsically and mentally. It would get boring after awhile because you would just be sittting there the whole entire time not incontrol of anything. There has been way to many technology objects that has been created which has been proven to make the human generation lazy. Creating safer transportation is positive and should be the direction cars should be leading towards. Driverless car may sound a little cool, but could lead to many dangerous harm. The dangers of a car driving itself isn't so safe. There could be many malfuntions that could create car crashes. Many malfuntions could happen such as not braking in time, string uncontrolably, elctrical explosions, or maye even if the car accelerates when it's not needed. Teenagers could sitting in one on the road texting and not paying attention while the vechile is heading towards a tree or a person. The danger zones of driving will rise even more. Technology with other minor things is already expensive, hard telling how much these cars would cost. Cars already are very expensive to buy now, so what could make these cars easy to produce and sell? People just need to learn how to drive and enjoy it. the safty of the driverless cars isn't asured to the public and can make tragities. With all the new technology what couldn't stop a hacker hacking into your cars computer base. And then you have automakes and driver problems in who would accident fault would be on. this driverless car inventing process should just be stopped."
10669,0,"In ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"", I am against cars being able to drive themselves for us. One of the many reasons im against it is, today you already see reported incidents when someone in control of the car is steering and the car takes control and causes them to wreck and thats not even having the car in complete control. Another reason im against it is, I personally think that everyone should be able and know how to actually drive a car ran by them themselves. In section 9 it states,"" Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers."" that passage backs up my opinion because if we dont have alert drivers its probably because these drivers now think its okay to text and drive and thats not what we want. People are smarter than technology, the more technology you use the greater it is going to crash, for example just like using a car that does everything for you. You want people staying alert and driving themselves to keep from becoming not aware of their surrondings, the more your not alert the more pron you are to getting in a accident or even worse, stay with driving by yourself and not by cars."

I think that it is an alien because it has a face we haven't ever see. This could prove that there is a such thing as an alien in this galaxy. It may not of came from Mars but landed face up on Mars and its body was eroded. The face could of been part of an alien that was living here and was the last on Mars. It looks like it could of been there for thousands of years but maybe not. Since this is current we could figure out what it is and have a drone go pick it up. This could lead to many different theories, but I think that It is an alien from another planet. Now that you know that this face on Mars is an alien you could become a scientist like me and figure it out. I think that in the future we will get a drone on Mars and pick up the face and maybe the body. I hope that you agree with me and find out more facts about the face."

Another note that would have it be more helpful is help older people to drive. My great grandma never learned how to drive. If these cars were here just maybe it could help her get out of the house more. Many people think that if you get in a car accident, while the smart car is driving the manufacturer should be punished. I don't think this because you still have to stay alert when something is coming up. One other thing I can think of is that the car is not fully driverless. This to some people is a downfall, but to me I think it is awesome. The shows that we are getting lazier by the day. The author states, ""... but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires the human skills, such as navigating through work zones and accident... the humn driver must remain alert and be ready to take over."" This to me is a major downfall to the car. Driver should still be resposible for any damage that is done to another person or other car. If you are going to drive make sure you focus on the road head and leave the phone alone till you get to your destination or home. I still think the smart cars are going to be a big thing. Even though it has its downfalls, I think that they will help wth a few issuse. It can maybe helo people get over their fear of driving, or teach older people to drive. But if they do become driverless, I think the driver should still be held responsible."
16043,0,"I think that ""driverless"" cars are very dangerous. The driver could get too comfortable and fall asleep at the wheel, the car doesn't drive comepletly by it's self so you could not pay attention and get into a wreck, or you could get in trouble with the law because you hit another car or even a person. I would think that these driverless cars are dangerous because the car could mess up and get into a wreck or hit a pedestrian and you would have to be charged because its the law. You would have to pay attention at all times no matter what because you never know what is going to happen. The driver could get tired waiting on their turn to drive and fall asleep. These cars can also accelarate and brake without the control of the driver so the car could speed and you would get a ticket for speeding, or the car could brake and cause the car behind you to wreck into you. I think that driverless cars are dangerous because they require alot of attention. I would rather just drive myself so that I know that I would be safe and I wouldn't assume that the car can just drive by its self and get distracted by texting or talking to the people in the car. So, if you have a hard time staying awake when bored or paying attention then I wouldn't think this would be a car for you."
10736,0,"Driverless cars are coming and when they get here they are going to surely benefit todays drivers. Driverless cars are safe and not yet to mention they are quite a pressure remover. The cars that are being invented do although require a plethora of financial payments but these payments will all be causes to the splendid outcome for lower car accident numbers. Many people have been in death raining accidents that just so happened to either murder them, the other people in the car with them, or in some cases the opposite victim that was also involved in the accident. Driverless cars will surely benefit society to a greater extent than todays average cars. Driverless cars contain safety precautions that acquire a person to still be alert in the car in which is beneficial due to the fact that without being the driver on particular days where a driver is tired many citizens may just happen to doze off. These cars can notify the driver when human assistance is needed on a bumpy road or a rainy day. ""The Google car announces when the driver should be ready to take over"" (Driverless Cars Are Coming par. 7). This announcement allows the driver the appropiate time length to be prepared for take over time. Regular cars may have a shift in gears or something out of proportion and a driver may be relaxed under the wheel but without any notification like the driverless car gives the driver would have to deal with a possible accident or a quick transaction. Although it is common to stick to what people know nowadays, many people are better drivers with driverless cars. Driving can frustrate citizens and the outcome of driverless cars can benefit many people. Everyone should get a driverless car because it provides safe drives from one place to another. ""Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved"" (Driverless Cars Are Coming par. 10). This statement provides proof that there will be a good outcome to this invention. Driverless cars are coming and when they get here people should get them for not only their relaxation benefits but also for their splendid safety procedures. Todays cars have become more hazardous due to the lack of safety produres and the fact that the driver is struck with full contol. These cars should surely be not only developed but also purchased."
1424,0,"The author supports Venus mainly because it is as certain times closer to Earth than any other planet and could have been just like Earth at some point through time. I personally think that the author brings up good points of how Venus is somewhat like Earth. This similarity should make us want to learn more about Venus since we could possible learn more about our own planet from Venus. Venus has been been referred to as Earths ""twin"". Venus earned this title because it is the closet planet to Earth in terms of densitty and size. Venus can even occasionally be the closest to Earth in distance too. Earth, Venus, and Mars all orbit the sun at different speeds, sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times we are closer to Venus. Humans have sent spacecrafts to go to Venus before but none have survived there for more than a couple hours. Since Venus is not in habitable due to the atmosphere being made up of 97 percent carbon dioxide and the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid and the temperatures being over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on out planet, so making this trip and going on to the planet would be unrealistic because of the conditions, but this does not mean that studies cannot be conducted from above the planet to get research and data. To research the planet from above they could build a space station or launch a satalite above Venus and then maybe even build a Rover out of a very strong durable heat resistant material and actually put it on the planet. Any information we could learn from Venus and about its past, could help us learn a lot about our own planet, we could even find new materials and better our own technology, Venus is a very good option for a planet to explore, the risk and cost might be high but any exploration could lead to tons of benefits. Today Venus is still similar to Earth, it still has some features that are like the ones on Earth such as the surface being rocky, Venus also has valleys, mountains, and since it can sometimes be the closest planet for planetary vist. Since a lot can be learned from venus scientists and workers at NASA have been developing compelling ideas for sending humans to go study our sister planet."
15948,0,"Driverless cars will be a part of the world whether anyone likes it or not. But I the type of person that does not want driverless cars but for good reason. Yes, driverless cars are becoming more and more smart everyday and accomplishing great things but we as humans won't be able to accomplish as much as we want to. Say there is a 16 year-old with a new lisence which she has been eagerly waiting for for a long time. What kind of driving experiences will she have? Where will she go? She doesn't know yet but she can't wait to find out. But she won't really have any adventures because her driverless car is doing everything for her. Her first drive to a faraway place is done mainly by her car. What kind of accomplishment is that? Humans have become lazier through time and I think it is time to fix that. I'm not saying that we shouldn't be able to have things that make life easier but we should do things on our own sometimes. Not only that but the people making these cars are working on the wrong thing. Our planet is dying. This is the truth and we need to figure out ways to to keep earth healthy. Yes the driverless cars use less fuel but can't they do that with a driver? If a driverless car can use less gas than the cars today then there is certainly a type of car out ther that uses less gas with a driver in it. The cars with drivers may not be the safest way to go but we can make cars safer if we use the technology to do it. A driverless car is very safe but why can't that be put into a car with a driver in it. It can. People just need to make it possible. If we make cars safer with the driver still driving the car then we make life easier but still place the responsibility in ourselves so that we don't become less mature when it comes to it. A car is a great thing to have and to be able to manage. So we can't let ourselves let driverless cars rule over that. We should propose how we can make cars safer without taking away the responsibility of driving them."
5692,0,"For many years, researchers have stared at the Mona Lisa. They have made countless observations and have even created this new technology that detects her emotions through facial recognition. Creator Prof. Thomas Huang has named this the Facial Action Coding System. This may not seem very important in the outside world, but the use of Facial Action Coding could be very beneficial in classrooms because it could understand the student's frustration and confusion and would modify the lesson to better fit the student, counselors could use it ot help determine how a student is truly feeling, and it would help teachers better understand the students who rarely talk in their class. Facial Action Coding could be benificial in classrooms because the technology could understand the student's frustration and confusion and modify the lesson to better fit the student. In schools all around, students are starting to give up. They get too angry at their homework and decide that they don't want to work on it anymore. The problems don't change--but with the Facial Action Coding System, the problems and even the lesson itself could change and become easier for the student. This would allow for the student to wrap their mind around the concept that was given to them. In the article, Dr. Huang states in paragraph 6, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when astudent is becoming confused or bored... Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'"" This quote tells its readers that that is what Dr. Huang wants this new technology to do. Teachers have to follow a guideline and a lesson plan; they have to be on track as to what the students are learning. Dealing with almost fifteen to twenty students a class, the teacher cannot physically help a student one-on-one all of the time. The Facial Action Coding System, however, would be able to. Making it more simple and more efficient for both the students and teachers. Counselors could also use this technology. Counselors could use the Facial Action Coding System to determine how a student is truly feeling. When sitting in a counselors office, students may be tense or very nervous. Whatever they're in there for, the counselor will have to help that student. With the techonology, counselors could take one look at their face and find out what's bothering them if they are not completely open about it. The counselor would be able to find out if they're sad, upset, scared, or just pulling their strings to get out of class. A counselor's job is to make sure that the students on campus are mentally in check and are ready for the next school year with their classes and progress. When a student enters their office, the technology could sensor the student, making the counselor's job easier and time efficient. When the counselor is done with the student, they're sent back to class. The system could help students and teachers there as well. The Facial Action Coding System may be useful to help teachers understand the students who rarely talk in class or are deaf. In paragraph 6, Dr. Huang makes a wonderful point--""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" In class, students will nod their heads when they agree or understand something that their teacher is presenting them with. But what if they don't nod? Facial Action Coding could help the teacher understand that they're going to fast or that the student is lost. The teacher would then be able to assist in further explaining the lesson or even trying to make the lesson more fun and exciting. There are some students who would rather sit in their desks, avoid being wrong, and won't ask questions because they're too shy. This system would give the oppourtunity for students that were never given the chance. Overall, the Facial Action Coding System could be very useful in classrooms due to being able to modify and better fit the student based on their emotions, counselors being able to use it, and as well as letting teachers better understand students who are either deaf or rarely talk. Facial Action Coding may only progress, and progressing it shall."
4891,0,"In ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author, Nick D'Alto, shows us that this technology that allows it to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. By using example of the human face muscles and Mona Lisa as an example, allows us to get into debt about our facial expression and what they give out to other people. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of student in a classroom is valuable because it will be able to read the muscles in the face that are being used in the expression we are doing. "" The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major musces in the model must move like human musces."" By creating a 3-D model of the face it allows it to have an exact replication of the face and muscles being used; therefore it will be able to show how people are really feeling. ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, and, disgust, fear and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" By classifying every emotion with the musces allows the technology to get an an acurrate feeling of the person. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of a studemt in a classroom is valuable because in the passage it gives examples of the exact muscle and emotion that correlate with each other. "" For eample, your fronttalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're surprised; your arbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger. They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one. In the real smile, the zygomtic major (muscles that begin at your cheek bones) lift the corners of you mouth. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different musle, the risorius."" By using the muscles in the face, this allows us to see an exact repredention of the emotions the person is feeling and will help kids in the classrooms. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of a studemt in a classroom is valuable because it will allow the student to feel more comfortable in their learning enviroment and lern at their own pace. "" 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.' "" By having this technology it will allow students to be more engaged in the learning and be able to undestand better the subject."
5503,0,"I would claim the value of using this technology because it would not only help the students but also help the teacher. Teachers often times don't put themselves in the positon of a student, which causes their lessons to be on the boring side. As the author states, ""a classroom computer could regonize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" By doing this the teachers would be able to get in the mind of a student. If a teacher knew when a student was getting bored of a lesson this would help the teacher to ""spice"" up the lesson and make it more interesting or at least easier to follow. As far as the student is concerned the lessons would be easier to comprehend. This technology would modify the lesson, as the author states it. Just think if the lessons were easier to follow more students would be able to understand. The students would also be less likely to fall asleep during class. If the students were paying attention it would produce better grades and may even increase graduation rates. Although the ability to read the emotional expression of students would give the lesson an advantage and the student the ability to express themselves without words, being able to see the emotions of others could resolt in conflict. The teachers would be able to see how a student felt at any given moment. Also this would decrease the ability for students to have free will to think the way they want. Even though like the passage says that you would be able to see this emotion through expression alone. There are a lot more than just one peron in a classroom. In conclusion, based on the information the article uses, it would be of value to use this technology to read the emotional expression of students in classroom. It would help both the students and the teachers. Yes, the idea has both pros and cons but that comes with all decisions."

Another reason he wanted to go is he would go meet new kind of people and there cultures and what type of foods they eat. luke learned that he liked the expericence because he became more aware of people of other countries and their needs.

Luke also after he was done with the Seagoing Cowboys, his family opened their house to a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years. I think in the story that luke was adventurist, brave, and careing to go over seas and instead of going to college he went to go help people in need. I think luke is adventurist and brave because he wanted to go and see all kinds of diffrent countries in the world and wasn't scared to see what is in the world."
8506,0,"What if the scores of students could raise to a point that was higher than ever before? That could be that case with the Facial Action Coding System. Dr. Huang says, ""A classroom computer could detect when a student is becoming confused or bored."" When a student is being monitored and the program picks up that the student is bored or uninterested, it could try to use several tactics to change the lesson based on the emotions. instead of teaching like the lesson is a documentary, the lesson can start teaching like its in an actual classroom. It can use these results it will pick up and make it so the next lesson will be similar. the program will still monitor the child during the lesson to see whether the student is becoming uninterested or even disengaged in the lesson. When students are interested in a lesson they pay more attention bringing about a more comprehensive student who will do better on grades, homework, and tests. Taking an alternative route using the software to monitor the emotions of a child will be effective at catching a kid who is mentally distraught, a potentail threat to society, or the school! This technology will raise that bar for the standard intelligence of the children who will make this program work even better for generations to come. That is why this technology will be beneficial to the classroom environment."

The facil code can only tell how you feeling by smiling and making faces humans can tell faster if a person is fake smiing or real smiling then what the computer can. Facial code can only detect some feeling like happy, suprised, angry, digusted, fear, and sadness. Think about it sceince is great and improving but so are humans we geting smarter. Imagine this you need a computer to find out some one else emotions. Humans can figure this out our self. Facial coding can only find out certian emotions not all we can find out more emotions then what a computer can, and we know more emotions then what the computer can read. If the facial code work think about how expensive this computer cost we will have to pay to figure out people emotions when we see them and look at them everyday. With computer it states in the text ""most human communication is nonverbal including emotional communication so computer need to under stand that too notes Dr Haung"". It also states you can probably tell how a freind is simply by looking her in the face. With that imformation we dont really need facial coding system to tell how we feeling. Imagine if these computers worked If it did people would be using but not everybody could afford to get those computers. Humans are smart who ever thought of facial coding sytem need more facts, because people can tell how you feel in a matter of seconds when they look at you. Facial code can be a waste of time and money you can just figure it out your self without a computer. Think about this aslo humans can found out more felling then a computer.

In the article, it says "" we humans perform the same impressive 'calculation' every day"". If humans already have this natural ability, then adding more technology into the classroom that teacher could already be doing, is uneccessary and distracting. I am sure there are some upsides to this, but it really just feels like an invasion of the students privacy. In the article is says "" ' Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instrucor' "" The teacher can not just modify an entire lesson because one student is confused, that is unfair to the students that understand the lesson already. Instead, the teacher could work with the student individually and help them with what they are having trouble with.

In the text it states it explains to you how this new technology can scan your facial recognitions and can tell how you're feeling. First the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of your face and all 44 major muscles in the modele must move like human muscles.

This software can identify misex emotions and each expresion is compared to a neutral face that shows no emotion. This new technology advancement would be able to recognize one's emotions but we can't always rely on technology. For instance we don't need technology to know when a friend is sad but we can just recongize their expresions by simply looking t their face. This technology can also be misleadng, In the text it states, ""A classroom computer could recgnize when a student is becomine confusef or bored..Then it culd modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""

This technology is basically based upon the muscular action units one gives away. In the text states, ""They even indicate the difference between a geneuine smile and a forced one.

Yes you know how you are felling but this technology can help give you the confidence you need. This system shows how it can improve one's life by it understanding your facial muscles that give away your expressions.

23327,0,"To State Senator, As many believe, the nation of the Unitred States of America is one of the most free countries. The citizens have more power and rights then those of another country. Although, are we truely getting the power we claim to get. One of the biggest powers a citizen of the US recieves is electing the president who will serve a term for the next four years. But, do we truely recieve that power. No if there is an Electorial College. The govnerment claims that we are the one truely electing the president, and many of the citizen even believe that, but the fact is that the Electorial College take away all of those rights. This government group doesnt always follow the word of the people, it is unfair, and the ""winner-takes-all"" mathod does not show what the true outcome should be. When the Founding Fatrhers developted this country, they had stricted standards in mind, ""The people would have a say."" If we where fallowing the wishes of our Founding Fathers, we would not allow our nation to make false acuizations about what the people are acually capable of doing. Say the state has a majority of Republican vote, so we then send 27 Rebulican electors to the Electorial College. Although, it is copletely possible that our electors don't follow the word of the people, and vote for something other than what they had said before. This shows that although the state's citizens can chose the electors, we acually have no role in the final election of our President. As said in The Indefensible Electorial College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong, ""Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes the state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, sometimes the presidential canidates themselves."" This proves that there is no set system in place for choose this extremely important electors that are the electors of how our country survives the next four years. They said that it is even possible for the presidential canidates themselves to the be the ones to choose the electors. Will the follow the word of the peoplem, or just choose based on what is best for them? No one know. By doing this, we are putting our whole future in someone elses hands. Not to mention, the whole election proccess is unfair for both the citizens and the presidential canidates. If there is a majority vote from the people throughout the nation for one party, once the Electorial College votes, the peoples decition can be overridded. This means that not only is the next president going to be someone that most of the citizens didn't want, but the presidential candidate who should have won, now is stuck is a possition where the country wants him in office, but it is over. If the people get to vote, let them vote. Why claim to give them something, waste their time, aswell as yours, and then have that concencous not make a difference? If the government where truely looking to help and do what the people want and need, then they would trust us to put the right person in office. Lastly, the system put in place for the Electorial College is not a strong system. The ""winner-takes-all"" method does not allow for a truelly acurate election. When the state votes, for example, two thirds democratic, then only two thirds of our electors should be democratic. With this you are getting a complete representaion of the wants of the people. As state in What Is the Electorial College, ""Most states have a winner-takes-all"" system that awatds all electors to the winning prsidential canidate."" This means that even if the votes where close, like 50 percent plus one, they majority voted party would get 100 percent of the electors. That math make no sence. If voting for out future is not in out own hands, then let the people who are taking the responsability truely reflect our own thoughts. With elections for many different things, there are always winner and loosers, that is just how the game works. Although, the game shouldnt work as if there was a set winner. In that case, there is no use in even playing. When the electors are chosen to elect the next President, we, as citizens have no idea if that is the proper peson to choose. We don't know that that person will completly fulfill the resposability they have are being the hands of the people. The Electorial College takes away our rights, is completly unfair all all sides of the story, and has a bad system set in palce. With all of this said, there is no need for it. It does nothing but hurt us and have the possibility of making false elections. We have the ""right to vot,"" let us truely and completely fulfill that right. Sincerly, your citizen"
11394,0,"The Face on Mars was not made from an ancient alian civilization. We have proof of this because our cameras are ten times sharper than the cameras we had to orginally photograph the face, the shadows just create an illusion that the formation is a face, and the Face on Mars has been confirmed to just be a mesa. The first photo we had of the Face on Mars was taken in 1976 by Viking 1, which would not have had the most advanced cameras. The photo is blurry and unclear, not a very reliable source to base alien belief on. Even the photo in 1998, ""snapped a picture ten times sharper than the orginal Viking phtos."" Compare the photo from 1976 to the photo taken in 2001. The 2001 photo clearly shows that the Face on Mars is in fact not a face at all. Any belief that the Face on Mars was created by aliens should now be wiped away because of how clearly the photo shows that the Face is just a landform. When the original photos were taken in 1976, there was the illusion that there was a face staring right back at the Viking 1. Shadows around the Face created this illusion that made it look like and Egyptian Pharaoh. When the 1976 photo was released for people to see, the caption read, ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Even the experts immediately recognized the Face on Mars as just a natural landform with shadows. Though some people believed the Face was an alien artifact, this theory is disproved quickly because in truth the Face on Mars is just a mesa. The Face on Mars is in the area of Mars known as Cydonia. Cydonia is known for having lots of Martian mesas. Martian mesas are very similar to mesas or buttes found in the American West. Chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program Jim Garving quotes, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" Which is a lava dome the takes the form of an isolated mesa, and is approximately the same hight as the mesa known as the Face on Mars. Though some theorists still believe that the Face on Mars was created by aliens, it turns out to be just a Martian equivalent of a mesa. This is proved true by the advanced camera quality, the proof that it was just shadows creating the illusion that the Face on Mars was actually a face, and the fact that the Face has been confirmed to just be a mesa."

This can be seen when the author says that the value obtained is that scientist can get an insight on the planet Venus so that they are able to know what lives out there beyond Earth. The author also explains how by the inquiring nature of humans have resulted in many life-threathing acts to be seen as challenges that are yet to be overcome. To overcome the obstacles of Venus such as the rocky surfaces, an atmosphere consisting of 97 percent carbon dioxide, clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acids and average temperatures of a staggering 800 degrees Fahrenheit, NASA has come up with several options which wil create a possible way for humans to visit Venus. One idea would be to put humans on blimp-like vehicle that would make it possible for humans to float above Venus. This cancels out the dangers of being exposed to high temperatures and experiencing rocky situations. However, there are some defects in this plan. this is because scientist will only be provided with limited insight on Venus as most forms of light is not able to penetrate throught the thick atmosphere and therefore, photography and videography becames unfruitful. Scientist aren't also able to research and study the the surface of Venus as samples cannot be taken. Nevertheless, scientist are not giving up and still have hope that Venus will be accessible. Some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide hsave been tested in chambers with conditions similar to Venus and have managed to last up to 3 weeks. They also are looking into using old technology called mechanical computers, which are said to be more resistant to heat, pressure and several other forces. In the end, the author explains how despite all the hurdles that have to be considered to make our mark on Venus, it will definitely be of much value to not only scientist but to human kind."
24572,0,"The Electoral College has been used for years. I agree that we must keep it this way. Yes, It is possible that the outcome of the popular vote that the people have chosen is not in agreement but it has been the best way of selecting a President. It is highly unlikely that when the people vote for certain selection of the candidates group of electors will change their mind. It has happened before but It's rare. I suggest that the electoral college stay, and not change the election because It has not only been used for years, but also some of the citizens may make a mistake in who they vote for, and atleast with the Electoral College we can make sure we have the right President. Each Candidate has their own electors and it take 270 of electoral votes to choose a President and since they are from the same group, they wouldn't choose someone else. It has happened in 2000, as it says in the excerpt. This system has been used for years, why change it now. The Electoral Collge has worked this way for years, the founding fathers came up with it as a good process. It is completely fair to all. The people get to select their candidate and the electors know what their responsibilities are. The citizens aren't completely able to control the electors ideas but they might have a bit more knowledge on the subject. 'Some citizens may get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate' excerpt from passge. This refers to the fact that we may have chaos if we let the people decide directly who is our President. We need an insider to review our peoples choices and make sure that it is the correct one, and what better way than to have the Electoral College do it. It depends on the state and the candiddate's political party, In which you chose. The People will get what they asked for, their has been times In which it that is not always the case, but the electors usually make the decision the people has asked for. As said in the passage ""In defense of the Electoral Collage"", Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee, and the trust is rarely betrayed, This system is the best one yet. Our people are well informed but not always, If we take out the Electoral college, we are leaving our country in their hands and people make mistakes sometimes, with the electoral college we have various people making the right decision. It's like when an author writes a book, they don't get it published right away, they have people to make sure their spelling is correct and they make many other different corrections. It's the same with the Electoral college and the way the president is selected. As my state senator, I suggest we keep this system."

22024,0,"Dear Florida Senator, I can't help but notice the controversy regarding the Electoral College and its role in electing the President of the United States. While most argue that the Electoral College is a violation of freedom, I strongly believe that the Electoral College premotes equality for the candidates and the people. By using the Electoral College system, we create an equal playing field for the candidates. For example, The Electoral College system serves as ""checks-and-balances."" In the words of the Office of the Federal Register in ""What Is the Electoral College?"": ""The founding fathers established [The Electoral College] as a compromise between Congress and election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens,"" (Office of the Federal Register 1). This system of voting balances the voice of the people with the voice of Congress. Opposers might say that our votes don't even matter due to the fact that the popular vote doesn't directly determine our nation's President. This is far from reality, because the popular vote is vital to the Electoral College. The Office of the Federal Register writes that ""most states have a 'winner-take-all' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate,"" (Office of the Federal Register 7). This means that the popular vote does determine - for most states anyway - whether or not the candidate recieves all of the electoral votes for that particular state. Not only does the Electoral College ensure equality for the candidates, but for the people as well. For example, in ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" Bradford Plumer whines about how, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters,"" going on to say that, ""Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states,"" (Plumer 13). However, Richard A. Posner makes a fair point: ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president...[If a candidate with only regional appeal becomes President] the residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised - to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president,"" (Posner 19). Moreover, Posner also writes that ""Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign - to really listen to the competing candidates - knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average...and the most thoughtful votes should be the ones to decide the election,"" (Posner 20). Overall, the Electoral College is a symbol of our freedom of speech. I do hope you take my thoughts under consideration. The Electoral College may be called ""outdated."" But as the saying goes, ""If it 'aint broke, don't fix it."" Sincerely, PROPER_NAME"

I believe trying to make the everyday life easier is great, but we cant depend on technology for everthing because everything doesnt always go correctly. ""This necessitates the acr be ready to quickly get the driver's attention whenever a problem occur."" This statement from the passage shows that technology can not do everything right 100% of the time. im pretty sure if I out my life in the hands of something I want nothing to go wrong 100% of the time. Even though GM has came up with ways to get the attention of driver's such as vibrating seats, flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays. While all of them may be good ideas, everything comes with flaws such as how would this work on a person diagnoised with sleep paralysis? ""If technology fails and someone is injuried, who is at fault the driver or manufacturer"" thsi shows anything could go wrong at any point and time.

I can see why some people would want driverless cars and why some people wouldn't want driverless cars. So, before I tell you my opinion, let me tell you the pros and cons of driverless vechicles. If we have driverless cars in the future, getting to places will be much more faster. There will be less or zero accidents if the cars are designed well. Also there would less gas consumed in total. Now for the cons, if we have driverless cars people couldn't enjoy the freedom of going around and driving for ""fun."" Also if there was a power outage or a malfunction, the cars would cause multiple accidents and people would get hurt or killed. Although these problems can be fixed with simple solutions, they're still things to consider. Even though some problems will arise because of driverless cars, I would still like to see them in the future. If we made streets for driverless cars and different streets for normal cars, that would one of the cons. In conclusion, I would like to see driverless cars in the future and I think we will."
14666,0,"Some people choose to say that the Face was created by aliens, but I am here to tell you that it definetly is not an alien structure, simply a natural landform. In 1976 I must say, it certainley did resemble a man made face. Though now that we have a clearer picture from 2001 it is very obviously just a natural landform. It resembles landforms similiar to the ones around the Amercian West. It is really just the Martian equivilent to those particular landfoms. The two are so similar in formation and shape. The most recent picture is so clear and high definition that even if it werre some kind of shack or Egyptian pyramid, you would know it for a fact. The picture taken in 1998 was on a slightly cloudy day, so I understand the doubt from some of you. Though we did take another picture, and it was on a very clear summer day, and it is mothing but a simple lava dome, that has taken the form of an isolated mesa about the same height os the Face on Mars. It was very hard work just to try and get that picture, and I would like to assure you that it is definetly no ""Martian Made"" structure. We got very close on a very clear day, and you can definelty see that those were just shadows, and nothing short of a dissapointment. What you don't understand is, that it would benifit us if it was a Martian's craft. It would give the tax payers evidence and reason to support us and give us their money to support the cause. SO therefore I rest my case tht clearly we are not lying because it would benifit us if there were Aliens crafting these thing, but the simple fact is, there isn't."
13736,0,"While the Face on Mars does look like a face, there is no way possible that it could be an alien artifact. Research, advance in technology, quotes from scientists, and actual evidence proves that this is just a natural landform on Mars. Mars has had plenty of speculation on this, yet all the answers have come back that it is impossible. No, there is not a lot of evidence, but there is enough to show that this is just a mesa. When scientist first found the Face, it was already speculated to be a mesa. This was because of the place where it was located, Cydonia. Cydonia is known for having many mesas in its area. This one just happened to have shadows on it appearing like a face. Let us not forget that the Face was found in 1978. That is when space travel was still a new for the world. Technology was not that advanced as it is today. The last picture was taken in 2001, which was twenty years later after the first photograph was taken. Spacecraft and photos had improved twice as much. Even though technology has improved we still cannot tell whether it is an alien or not. We must go off of facts. Scientist Jim Garvin stated that,""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, id there were objects in the picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could not see what they were!"" This shows that the Face could not even of been seen. So, it is impossible that it was an alien artifact. Mesas and buttes are very common on Mars. Especially in Cydonia. Technology has improved and there is no way we could see a face from that size. ""That's a lave dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face of Mars,"" said Garvin. Research and results have proven that the Face is just a landform like any other on earth."

Yes, our tecnology has exeted many challanges but there is fault in depending on tecnology. I think it would lead to problems handing ourselvs over to our vehicles. There are many things thought out about this topic but I feel like it is a short term adjustment. In the article it asks ""what roadblocks lie ahead for the autonomous car?"" This quote makes me feel like the manufacturers are eating more than they can chew. Is this a do now think later situation? Many have fantisized about this big development, what if they are doing it too soon? What about all the people who can't afford a car, let alone a driverless car? How will the roads be for them? I believe people would take advantage of this tecnology. It would become a hazard. What will these cars run off of? Can you plug them in to the wall or will you need to use fossil fules? I believe that if we start this, we are starting it too soon, because we don't completely know how it will turn out. This idea could increase crashes, or help provent them. There is no telling if it will help or not. The article states ""new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident."" I agree there needs to be new laws, if the cars are released to the public. With the new laws, I think there must be a quick and safe way to the hospital, if that person was in an accident. To insure everyone is safe, every driverless car should follow the traffic rules and stay at a safe speed. There may be a plan and blueprints for this idea, but the different outcomes are out of our controll. Untill the day there are no problems, then they should be used for the impaired and the cars should look different so that everyone knows it is a driverless car."

1919,0,The author supports his idea by saying how earth is like venus and some say that it is our twin. The author thinks that it would be a good idea to go to this planet because it hasn't been completly discovered yet and he is fascinated by the idea of going to venus. The author thinks that it will be a good place to take a look at because it is the closest to earth and that they very well could have reasources there to provide us and there could be some conditions that we would have to adapt to but he think that this could go the right direction if they can discover anything else on this mysterious planet. The author found that the temperature would be about 170 degrees fahrenheit and the pressure would be about sea level on the planet but it will survivable for humans. The author has found that some people have already been doing expierments to find a way to get something on venus so that they can have an idea on what is actually on the planet. In the passage it said that NASA has came up with an expierment that will allow the spacecraft to get on the planet and it will be able to get some information about the planet. NASA said that this expierment can last about 3 weeks on this planet only because of the harsh conditions that lives on the planet. Also NASA is thinking about going back to the old time technology because they think that it will last longer in the conditions better than the technology that we have now. In conclusion the author want to send a spacecraft un into space to find out information about this mystirous planet and he really thinks that us humans could very well live on this planet if it has the reasources that we need so that we can live. He also thinks that we are capable of being able to find a way to get all the information that wew need to know to be able to send something up into space to get more information about the planet itself. The author has talked to NASA and they have came up with an idea that going back to the old technology woundn't be a bad thing because with the bad conditions that are all on venus the old technology would las longer and the newer technology is faster and more powerful but it wouldn't last as long as the old technology would on venus.
23897,0,"Do people vote for the man who runs the country. No, thats the Electoral Colleges job. The Electoral College is a process in which a numerous 538 electors cast there vote from the people of their state want as their president. The people have no interaction but to put in there ballet and choose there own electors who favor the candidate. Congress counts the votes, and if a total of 270 votes are cast for a candidate then they are elected president. For most people this how they think this is but it's not. Who chooses the Electors the answer is the state. So the sometimes the popular vote never wins, but that that happens rarely. Many people like Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole dislike the idea of Electoral College for this reason, the popular vote sometimes never wins. Al Gore who won popular vote but lost the presidency to Bush, lost the because of the Electoral College people believed that this was unfair and blamed the electoral college. But there is some benefits to the process, example is that if the people voted the states with the larges population would always keep the balance unchecked,or if there there is a tie in the popular vote we wouldn't have to rely on a thousand voters to decide. But the voters of the Electoral College to decide. There are some draw backs to the process though. Since the number of electors are the based on the population of a state most state with few population numbers, careless about the election. There are reason why people find that we should keep the process,there are also reason many dislike the idea in the first place. Viewing the benefits and the weakness of the idea of the Electoral College made think that even though the College has flaws. Those flaws are rare and can be fixed, with proper work and planning."
23596,0,"Highways, roads, streets; they are everywhere. No matter where you are or what part of town, these are always found nearby. Wherever roads are found, so are cars. People have been driving vehicles since the 1950's and over time, have had many positive effects on the world; but they have also had many negative effects. Luckily, the government has been helping to reduce car usage to save the world. Limiting car usage helps the world become a better place by decreasing pollution and keeping individuals active. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal, cars make up ""12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe"" and can be responsible for ""50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States,"" (In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars). These percentages show how much humans rely on cars, which is negatively impacting countries. Greenhouse gases are extremely awful for the environment, and if they are not decreased significantly, then the Earth could become a bad place for existance. In many places, government officials have been trying to limit the percentage coming from cars, which has helped greatly. Rosenthal claimed in a different article, The End of Car Culture, that ""As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was...equal to where the country was in January 1995."" The drop of this percentage has decreased the amount of greenhouse gases in the world. Many events all over the world have contributed to the lower percentage. For example, the Car-Free Day in Bogota, Columbia has been a huge hit since the mid 1990's and is continuing to grow each year (Andrew Selsky, Car-Free Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota). This activity along with others will continue to bring the percentage down until it is hopefully extremely small. Fast food and the lack of exercise has increased the number of obese people greatly. With a lack of transportation, there is a bigger opportunity for individuals to eat healthier and exercise more. Andrew Selsky, a writer from the Seattle Times published an article about Bogota's Car-Free Day. He confirmed that ""It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths,"" (Car-Free Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota). The building of new sidewalks has increased the number of people using them each day. With more people walking and exercising, the rate of obesity should decrease dramatically. Not only is exercising important, but eating healthy is as well. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal, cities in Germany are now stating, ""stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway,"" (In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars). Since there can only be a limited number of shops in the city because they have to be close by, healthier options have been chosen more often, keeping people in shape. Not only do the individuals look healthier, but they feel better. Saving the Earth and other people are two huge causes for limiting car usage. Keeping both alive and healthy can keep everyone happy and safe. Reducing car usage has great advantages and all humans should consider different methods of transportation; walking, bking, or even carpooling are great alternatives to help the world. It may not seem like it now, but the decision of limiting car usage can be a life or death situation."
13018,0,"I believe that driverless cars are the way of the future. The potential benefits of driverless cars far outweigh any negative aspects; they allow for increased convenience & safety and help the environment. One of the primary attractions of driverless cars is the fact that it makes driving much easier for people, because less work and interaction is required from them. Though most technologies today require some human driver to be present, the stress placed upon them is still greatly reduced. For example, in paragraph 8, ""Some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems..."" Such a system would make long rides much more enjoyable while presenting minimal risk to the passangers. A second benefit of self-driving cars is that because computers have much faster response times than humans riding in one of these cars is simply much safer. In paragraph 5, the author discusses how even fairly simple computer systems from the 1980s have greatly reduced risks related to car accidents through technologies such as anitlock brakes. By continuing to develop these systems to become more powerful and responsive, the potential for better safety and lower accident rates only increases. This is something proven in paragraph 2: Google's self-driving cars have driven over 500,000 miles without incident. This in itself is highly impressive, but the consideration of applying this to the consumer market is huge. A final reason why I consider driverless cars to be very important to the future of the automotive industry is their potential to help the enviroment. Today, vehicles are one of the top sources of atmospheric pollution - they contribute millions of tons of CO2 gas every year. Though self driving cars don't offer a direct solution, they certainly are a step in the right direction. In paragraph 1, the author states that one of the founders of Google, Sergey Brin, believes that self-driving public transportation systems have the potential to reduce gasoline usage (and thus pollution) by half. Because of the benefits for convenience, safety, and the environment, I believe that driverless vehicles are the way of the future. Though there are legitimate concerns, such as the reliability of current technologies and the costs, I think these are far outweighed, and that government regulation should be lessened to allow for the testing and development of the technology in all states."
15949,0,"We all need to have a break right? Well,now Google wants to create a driverless car in the future. In this argumentative essay I will talk about how we should have driverless cars in the future and how beneficial it can be. I think that driverless cars are better and they should be allowed because some people drive from twelve hours to there destination and even thirty-two hours from their destination. I would say it is a good idea because some familys take road trips and the driver is usually very tired after hours of driving in the same position. According to paragraph one,Google cofounder Sergey Brin believes that such cars would fundementally change the world,and personally,it could change my dads world. Also,we need driverless cars becuase some people drive at night and their sight and brain can be unconscious and have a wreck. Driving at night can be and will be very exhausting,but if you are too tired to even pay attention to the road,the best thing to do is to lay down in your car and let the car do its own thing. Another reason I think it should be allowed is because of all the reckless driving there is in this world. Of course,according to paragraph seven,Google didnt extend the possibilites of having a successful driverless car. They just made the driverless car not really driverless. I mean,in paragraph seven it states clearly that the car will have a sensor in order for the passenger in the drivers seat to take action whenever there is an accident or upcoming traffic. In someway it sounds helpful but in another way it just sounds as if the driver is still driving no matter what. They should create driverless cars becuase some people have accidents and can result in death. So,to avoid that we need those driverless cars,we need something that can be useful for people who are seniors and when they are drunk or are just learning to drive. Also,we do need it for the people who take road trips or the people who have business trips and just have to drive for hours. My third reason on which we should have driverless cars is that we might want to see and enjoy the view of the outside. The passangers are not a problem when coming to viewing the outside world through their window,but the passanger will get exhausted just looking straight infront of him. We need to think that the driver also wants a little taste of what is out there to see. Like my mom,she likes to see out in the window but she cant because she has to keep her focus infront of her. Our brain can also go to a point where it can get exhausted and they eyesight fails some of the time it fails and the accidents happen. In conclusion,we should have driverless cars because they will be useful for all of us,especially the ones who have to drive for hours just to get to their destination. It will also be helpful for the people who drive at night. Some people cant even see at night and they just crash. So,I think that we should have driverless cars because it will be beneficial for all of us."
10059,0,"Driverless Cars Are Coming Manufacturers are making new cars that will be able to run without a human constantly operating the machine. As of now, Google, BMW, and other such companies have been making efforts toward this new era of technology, however ""Driverless Cars"" would be more of a danger and problem to our society than good. It would cause confusion with where to place fault in accidents or legal situations, computer run cars would malfunction just like any other computer run technology such as the ""iphone"", or ""MacBook"", Drivers would abuse their privelege and fall asleep ""at the wheel"", and this would encourage drunk drivers to drive, possibly skyrocketing drunken accidents and alcoholosim. In paragraph 9 under the section entitled, ""Wating on the Law"", the passage clearly states ""If technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" This is not only concerning but also a very dangerous thought. When we as humans give the liberty and saftey of our lives over to computers that are programmed to do tasks and that do not feel any human emotions, and then one of them kills someone in an accident, who is to blame? The computer, malfunctioned, but the manufacturer and ""driver"" didn't directly do anything. This type of machine still needs constant attention and alertness of the human within. Maybe even more so than when driving a normal car because the ""Driverless Cars,"" will alert you at random to take over quickly when human skills are needed. People may not be prepared to do so, and in that case, things could take a turn for the worst. The beauty of ""Driverless Cars"" would cause some people to abuse their privelege and maybe even drink or sleep with the knowledge that the car will drive for you. After all, whats the actual chance that the car will ask them to do something? People will think this and slack off on their responsibilities, causing a very dangerous situation. Technology is increasing and our future holds many things ahead of us. New cars are being made to drive for us but are we ready to take such a huge leap into this process? A leap that puts our lives in the hands of non-human, compassion-lacking, machines? ""Driverless Cars"" would cause more harm and more problems to our society than good."
920,0,"Venus is often referred to as Earth's twin planet because of the many similarities between both planets. Although, Venus may be a great planet for humans to live in there are many limitations when it comes to the planets surface. Venus has been known to be a suitable planet for humans because its size and density are alike to those of Earth. Along with being the closest to Earth in distance Venus has also been very difficult to study. None the less Venus should continue to be studied in order to find more comparisons between both Earth and Venus. As the author explains, Earth and Venus have many similarities that would have allowed for Venus to be hospitable. It is stated that "" long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like Earth."" (paragraph 4) This section from the passage explains how Venus could have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Not only did Venus have oceans but it now has various surfaces that are alike to those on Earth. Venus has valleys, mountains, and craters that are easily compared to those on Earth. Demostrating how these planets can be compared helps the author support his claim by giving detail as to why NASA should continue studying Venus. Since both planets show many comparisons Venus could be considered our planetary visit however, not only are there various similarities but there are also numerous limitations as to why the planet Venus is inhabitable. Although, both planets can sustain life there are various differences that demostrate why the planet Venus is incapable of doing so. As the author states in paragraph 3 there is a ""thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus."" making it very difficult for any light to enter the planet. Not only will the planet be dark it will also have high temperatures reachign 800 degrees Fahrenheit. It is also stated that "" Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes,powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface."" Many of these limitaions described by the author are similar to those we have on Earth however, they are ""more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth."" (paragraph 3) In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus "" it is stated that although Venus has many dangerous aspects astronomers are still debating on future visits to its surface. Astronomers are doing all possible research to find a way to get to Venus and study it because, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited bby dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imaginations and innovation."" (paragraph 8) In general further studies on Venus could allow NASA to gather more knowledge and explore more planets that could be similar to Earth. Overall, the author does a good job supporting his idea on why NASA should continue to study Venus despite the dangers it presents. The author fully explains the reasons why we should continue the studies by explaining the countless similarities both Earth and Venus contain. Not only does he explaint he reason why we should continue but he also describes the dangers that could be encountered while attempting to study the planet. In the end the author states numerous solutions that could be used to hava a safe and scientifically productive misison."
16691,0,"The idea of driverless cars has been the topic of the news channels lately. Companies are making new advances in their research and development of driverless cars. Though those who are working on building driverless cars have made some advances, there are still many unanswered questions. Driverless cars would help society in numerous ways. By having driverless cars take over the roadways, it would help with traffic combustion. Many people could then ride in one car, there again cutting down on the amount of cars on the roads. Not only would driverless cars help with combustion, but also the pollution put out by cars today would be minimized. If you have many people in one car, that means less pollution! Speaking of traffic combustion, in 2013 the BMV announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" The article tells us that, ""The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" This excerpt from the article proves that many companies, like BMV, are making advances in trying to make the driverless car safer for its passangers. Driverless cars are not totally ready to be out on the road, because they can not drive in compacted traffic areas by themselves yet. The article tells us what the car can do, ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" This excerpt is offering information about what advances the driverless car has made and what areas it needs to improve in. Obviously, from that excerpt from the article, it can be infered the driverless car still needs some work. The driverless car would not only be good for cutting down on pollution and traffic combustion, but to also help cut down on DUI's and deaths caused by drunk driving. Many people like to go out and drink with their friends, especially on the weekends. How will they get themsleves home safely? Most of the time those who go out and drink, drive home with alcohol in their system. Having driverless cars would put an end to deaths caused by drunk driving, and DUI's. Drunk driving will no longer exsist once driverless cars are made legal. The article tells us, ""Antilock brakes and driver assistance still seem a long way from the dream of calling a driverless cab to take us wherever we desire, but Sebastian Thrun, founder of the Google Car project, believes that the technology has finally begun to catch up to the dream."" This excerpt from the article is sign, a sign that driverless cars are coming soon! This excerpt tells us that even though researchers and those involved in creating the driverless car, still have a little ways to go. Even though they still have some technological advances to make, the driverless car is foreseen to soon be ready in the near future! Driverless cars have so many benefits, good benefits at that! The driverless car can help regulate traffic combustion, pollution, DUI's, deaths caused by drunk driving and so much more. As the time keeps ticking, society keeps advancing. Having the technology and research to be able to enhance the driverless car, it should be seen driving on the roadways very soon in the near future!"
15395,0,"I think that driverless cars could be a great thing to have in the future, if they're safe enough to carry out the same actions that a driver can. In the future though, if kids grow up around driverless cars and aren't actually taught the rules of the road, then if there is an emergency that requires the drivers immediate attention as stated in the article, then the driver probably wouldn't know what to do. This can cause injury or even death to the people driving around him/her. I also think that driverless cars could be a great thing for the future of technology, but the question that is asked in paragraph 9 of the article is very important to keep in the minds of the car manufacturers. If people rely on their car to do the driving for them, then if there is a wreck who is a fault, the driver or the manufacturer? If you do get blamed instead of the manufacturer, then I don't think that it is really fair because you weren't doing the driving and you trusted the driverless car to get you to your destination safely, and it didn't do that. Considering these things though, if they were to teach the kids or even adult that didn't grow up around these cars the rules of the road and how the car works to prevent accidents like this from happening then i'd be all for driverless cars. They would be super cool in my opinion and if they worked correctly without many reported accidents, then i'd definitely try to get one. While taking drivers ed I was taught to be mindful of people around you and how your actions could effect other people and I just don't think that the driverless cars could really do that like a driver would be able to."

NASA's took some photos of the face. A lot of people seem to think that it is aliens that made look like face. People knew there most be others living on mars. Poeple think it made by made by aliens. Other knew that it was made by the first humens and to think it look like Egyptian Phareoh. Why was it there and want to know who put there and how did it get there. So did people think is was aliens or humens. Was it aliens or just landforms. To find out that it was just landforms some people want it aliens or first humens. Some what knew what is look like them was (middle butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho). Other knew that was landforms. What I think what it is a buch of rocks that stay there for a longtime. Here are my reason. There was a face on mars, They think it was made by aliens, and was it aliens or just landforms."
800,0,"In this article the author talk about Venius and its studies. He did a well job supporting this article with details and his own opinions. Venus isnt worthy of pursuiting dispite the dangers. In Paragraph 3 the author states the dangers of Venius and how they'd effect us. In sentece 1 the author stated "" A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus."" This is dangerous because that means theres a low oxygen level and human need oxygen to live. The author also stated that "" On the planet's surface, tempatures average over degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what Earth experiences."" If the atmospheric pressure is 90 times gratter that is likely to crush a human, also no human can live in 800 degrees farhenheit weather. This is not a habitat for humans to study or be in. Some reasons I think I might be undertandable to go is they have protection from all these things. The author states in paragraph 5 that if they had equipment that can aviod heat and unfriendly ground conditions they could study it more and I agree with that. Venus should not be a planet allowed to be studied without nesaccary equipment. The Heat, unfriendly gorund conditions, and the carbon dioxide blankets are all a risk to humans. Especially the atmospheric pressure is very danger and is why I dont think Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers."
9808,0,"My position on driverless cars, is that we most definitely do not need them. Their are a lot of different disadvantages to having driverless cars. So why try out a driverless car that's going to give you problems in the future? Just because it says that the car is driverless doesn't necassarily means that it's all that great like they to make it sound. Because you never know, their could be a lot of problems and malfunctions, and technical difficulties in having a driverless car in the future. The disadvantages on having driverless cars in the future is that, in the passage to the left in paragraph number 3 under the title that says ""Sensing the World"", it states that many futurists believed the key to developing self-driving cars someday wasn't so much smarter cars as smarter roads. They also used an example as well to back up what they were saying. ""In the late 1950s, General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special test track."" So I'm guessing that means that they to make to make sure that the cars work on the road first before making them in the first place. If I were you, I wouldn't even waste my time on getting a driverless car if they don't even know if the cars work on the road or not. And I know it said that it was inthe 1950s, but still. If they had to do that back then, just imagine what they will have to do make sure that they work in the future. You have to think about stuff like that ahead of time."
22403,0,"Almost every American has a car. Just go outside and look at your neighborhood.. I'm almost positive if you were to look everyone woukd have a car except for maybe 1 or 2.. The car is in our everyday use basically.. It helps us get to work, run aarons, take kids to school, etc. Now you may seem like theres only 1 risk of being in a car, but believe it or not.. When your car is on and running you're hurting the air.. Now I know the air doesn't have feelings! But logically you're hurting the air and yourself. America should limit car usage for simple reasons like air pollution, car accidents, and lazyness. These are the things we should focus on when we're in our cars or when we talk about saftey because all those reasons fall into that category. Small changes would be nice and helpful here. It reduce alot of problems we have, and stress. To kick this off, limiting the usage of cars would reduce the amout of air pollution that we are surrounded in now. Think about it millions of cars on and running everyday, sometimes if you look closely thers black gas coming out of the exhaust pipe.. And you're breating that? Out of millions of cars where do you think all those fumes go? they don't just dissapear! We're breating it! sure you might say ""So if im breathing it doesn't that mean i should be dead?!"" no.. that's not the case.. Yes it's bad for you but it hurts the earth mostly the gases break apart the atmosphere we have around to block other fumes from other places out. Think of the earth as a hamster in a ball.. The hamster is the earth and the ball is out atmosphere. The holes in the ball are the holes made from the gases that are released from our cars. This could let any type if gas in. In places like China there's a huge problem caused by all the cars.. it's called smog. Think of fog all over the place but its black and smells really bad. Not only that but it's really bad for you. You may think why don't we have that here? Well China is the most populated country in the world and almost everyone has a car. China is a pretty busy place you'd imagine because of all the people. Well you're right.. All the fumes coming out of those cars cause all that smog to contaminate everything there. Like water, animals, food, and even you! It's very bad. China needs to limit the usage of their cars in order to stop problems like that because it can effect everything around them. We should start worrying about the smog aswell because America is a pretty big place and all the busy cars can cause something similar to a smog, it may not be as big bu it will still cause damage. With all this said hopefully you understand what air pollution does and how we can reduce it. Moving along, Car accidents is a very big thing everywhere it causes thousands of deaths and injuries. We can stop all of it if we can limit the car usuage. you may say ""We can also just stop teens from driving.."" well yeah you can do that but how will they learn for themselves? Small rules metioned in the article are very interesting like cars with even licence plates were allowed to drive on mondays for example, and cars who drove with odd licence plates were fined for not obeying the law. On Tuesdays it would be the same but for odd licence plates. I think if this rules was implemented atleast 2 times a week it would help reduce the amout of accidents. There wouldn't be asmuch cars and it will be alot safer for people to drive. Sadly in alot of accidents they are fatal in highways, just imagine hundrends of thousands of cars driving in 3-4 lanes, you hit a car and it will obivously start a big problem from there. Think of it like dominos stacked in a line you knock one down and it just starts all tumbling in order. Yeah some cars avoid it but not always. The less the cars the less the accidents. Altough this is off topic but limiting the amout of cars on a freeway or highway per hour will limit the amout of accidents aswell. Back to the point, America needs to do something about the cars or it will just keep happening the more the drivers the more the danger out in the roads and highways. Hopefully this helped you understand more about the limiting of car use a little more. We're almost there, how ever we should stop revolving our selves around our car. If you live 10 minutes away from a supermarket or small convienience store just walk there.. You're just wasting money and polluting the air driving there.. A bike is a great way to get there you go decently fast, you don't get tired as much and it's a good exercise. We should stop getting to lazy because it is affecting both us and the earth very negatively. I would understand if you're in a hurry but seriously.. If you're 10-20 minutes walking distance why not just walk there.. You don't only exercise in the gym, get some fresh air outside.. well partially fresh air.. Yeah you get the point.. We need to get our butts up and walk places because our car isn't our only source of transportation! It's not just hurting you! Don't forget your purse or wallet! Because it has a big impact on that to with the gas prices going all over the place right now. Something people don't see when they're driving there car is what there doing to the enviornment, yeah i've mentioned it many times but it something we really need to look at because it effects your health tremendously. If you actually take the time to walk or bike to where ever you want it feels nice to actually walk and stretch your muscles out. We need more car reduced communities so that we don't just use our cars all day to get to places not to far away. To conclude, we need to start limiting the usage of cars in order to reduce alot of problems in our enviornment. Most of our enviornmental problems revolve around something we use everyday which is the car. Problems such as air pollution, car accidents, and lazyness. These things just don't effect you, if effects everyone including the envornment. This is something we should look out for ecause it is a very negative thing we have. Mainly air pollution because that affects everything.. And i mean everthing... Food, water, animals, plants, and even you.. So we all should look out for this and be a bt more responsible. We need more laws to help reduce the amount of smog and greenhouse gases that we have here today in our world. Hopefully you read this and learned alot about the importance of limiting the usage of cars and how it can effect everything."

Professor Thomas Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. The quote says, ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit."" Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System)."" Most of the experts can identify how people feel about anything like bored, happy, and etc. ""Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code. Perhaps Dr. Huang's emotion algorithms are a different sort of Da Vinci Code!""

For the exploring The Venus is a very challenging place to examine second more closely than the sun. The Venus is the closest planet to the earth with the size and the density the Venus is occasionally the closest in distance to earth.In Planet the are this called the distance speed. The distance speed mean that sometimes people are close to other planet because Venus is sometimes around the corner.

On the. planet the temperature average are over 800 degress fahrenheit and it pressure are 90 times greater than they experience in there own planet. Venus has the hottest surface temperatures of any planet in our solar system. what!!!! I thought the sun is hottest even the mercury is closer to the sun the Venus is like erupting like volcanoes like an earthquakes. The Venus mission both safe and scientifically productive.The (NASA) trying to to send human to Venus to study and at the thirty miles above the surface the tenperature would be 170 degrees Fahrenheit but it the same with the sea level on earth. To explore the Venus planet many of the researcher are working on innovation the would allow the machines to last long to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus.NASA working on other approaches to studying Venus.The scientist figuring out how spaceship can land and human to survive in the planet called Venus.Some scientist looking back in the past to get the technology called mechanical computers. They were made in the 1800s and they play a really important role in the 1940s the played them during world war ll. The technology computer are old but it still usefull till now because it device make calculations by using gears and levers and do not requires electronics at all it might be old it but usefull. The Venus need exploring because human curiosity will likely lead us into many intimidating endeavors. The travels on Earth should not be danger."

For heaven sakes sometimes when driving legs, fingers, or other body parts can cramp up! Say good-bye to cars that require to have a human driver at all times, and say aloha to driverless cars! Driverless cars have pros like GPS navigation and they provide more safety for the people, but cons such as weather conditions or technical errors. For the old folks, looking back into history television and cell phones were major and exciting changes. So now the young generation wonders what the next big thing will be. Driverless cars will perhaps be the next big thing? To me this is a fabulous and efficient idea! Personally, I dont know how many times someone has asked me for directions. My headache finally has come to an end! With driverless cars there is a built in GPS reciever using google if I recall back to the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming."" Nobody will ever need help on how to get somewhere. Just tell them the place and time and the cars will get you there possibly without a humans help the whole car ride. ""Safety first!"" is what they say now days. Watch for road signs and don't run the stop sign is commonly heard. Sometimes, when you go out late at night to a party, you have to watch for drunk drivers and be aware. Driverless cars have everyone covered. If everyone had a driverless car, the cars have the roads signs programmed in them. The drunk driver's wouldn't be the ones driving because the computer will. Many people often get tickets because they disobey roads signs and break the speed limit. How can you get in trouble for something you didn't do. Why don't we just add on the fact this will help you save money too! Man, just like McDonalds ""Im lovin' it!"" Some people will obviously be against the idea of driverless cars. The ""haters"" can't dull the shine of such a magnificent idea. I can't dull the fact that their conterarguments are something to consider. The weather is a great example. In some environments snow and rain can cause wrecks if the car is not somehow modified that the roads are bad. I suggest four wheel drive on all driverless cars. Another con is the fact that we are relying on technology. What if technology fails or the computer system goes wrong. Can we live with such uncertainty? Spare ourselfs the time to review and fix today to die tomorrow in a possible wreck due to this fear. By 2020 hopefully as they said, these cons will be reviewed and more reliable by then! Aloha to driverless cars! The cars sound like a spectacular idea! I'm very excited to see what these cars will do for society. They have advantages and disadvantages. In my opinion, with any product this will always be true. Driverless cars have pros like GPS navigation and they provide more safety for the people, but cons such as weather conditions or technical errors."

It would be save lots of people time, money, and stress if driverless cars were invented. with driverless cars feul needs will be cut in half, it would safer that cars today, and they would be able to avoid high trafic areas.I believe that the world needs driverless cars. Bhe average car today burns up alot of fuel unless ur drive an electic car or solar car. Ifdriverless cars were invented and manufactured the would most likely be smart cars that run of of solar or electricity, wich would cut down the need for gasoline aswell as cut save people money. The driverless car would also be much better for the planet than todays gas powered cars. I would love to have a driverless car becuase i would save alot of money on fuel. Besides saving money on fuel the driverless car would have to be one of the safest cars imagined. Today we have sensors that tell us when were about to back into somthing, we even have cars that will automaticaly stop when were about to crash now just imagine all of those features but in a car u dont have to drive. Lets say someone were to have injured themselves to the point that they need to go to a hospital, now lets say that person was all alone with no phone, but they were in there new driverless car wicth all they have to do is start and tell were to go and they were able to have there car drive them to the nearest hospital would that not be a lifesaver? So when it comes to saftey I believe the driverless car is the way to go. The driverless car woul more than likley have the worlds best trafic awearness progra posible. I would love to have a car that could avoid trafic and get me to my destination in the quikest time posible. If i could aviod trafic i would probily get less stressed out when drive during high trafic situations. I think if the driverless car did hav these trafic avoiding function they would be great for New Yorkers. Beyond getting a Person were they need to be, the driverless car would also be able to get them there in the best time posible witch means no more being late to meatings due to trafic, no more missing the kids dance resitals, and best of all no more need to by terrible GPSes that give people terrible directions. Great on fuel and the earth, great trafic avoiding technology, and great passenger saftey are just some of the reason I'm Pro driverless car but thats just one mans opinion. the car of the future first thought to be a Flying car, But now it's the driverless car. It dosent matter who made it, it matters driving it or should i say whos not driving it."

The electors equals the number of memebers in congressional delegation. Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for pureposes of the elctoral college. any of our candidates run for our president. It runs how they act and how they are with the people that they have. The presidential election are every four years. The winner takes all and be's the new president. Our governer talk to us like a big long speech. They do a recoding of the new president. The electoral college, they're not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after every thing. Over 60 percent of voters would perfer a direct election. This year voters can expect another close election. Voters vote not just for there president, but for a slate of electors. The people would have to vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors. The american people are lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest ellection.

15477,0,"Seagoing Coyboys. That's the name of the tremendous program I joined. I think a lot of people should join the Seagoind Coyboys program. The reason I think this is because it is a great way to sight-see, you're helping a large amount of people by giving them more of what they need, you can have fun playing all sorts of games and more, and you get the chance to go to new places. The first reason I should convince others to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program is because it is a great way to sight-see. In the story it says,""Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China."" It also states,""It was special taking a gondala ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water."" I think this enables the reader to realizeone of the reasons that the Seagoing Coybows is a program you should join is an great opportunity for people of all ages to sight see. The second reason I think I should convince you to join the Seagoing Cowboys is because you're helping a large amount of people by giving them more of what they need. I can tell this by when the passage states,""It was 1945, World War II was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover their food supplies,a nimals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administartion). UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas."" That is the program that Don and I signed up for. This shows why I think you should join the Seagoing Coyboys program because you're helping a large amount of people by giving them what they need. The third reason I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is because you can have fun by playing all sorts of games and more. In the text it states,""Luke also found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the emty holds where animals had been housed."" After it states that it says,""Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, bowing, reading whittling and games also helped pass the time. This shows why I think you should join the Seagoing Coyboyws program because you can by playing all sorts of games and more. The fourth reason think you should join the Seagoing Coyboys program is because you get the chance to go to new places. In the text it explains,""Besides helping people, I had the benefit of seeing Europe and China."" See, when you join the Seagoing Coyboys program you get to go to many places because you have to deliver the suplies and animals to the different places. So this shows, and explains, why I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because you get the chance to go to new places. All in all this passage I have written for you shows why I think that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program, because it is a great way to sight-see, you're helping a large amount of people by giving them what they need,you can have fun playing all sorts of games and more, and you get the chance to go to new places."

Another reason is it will be safer. The last reason is that would be able to listen music and relax without having to worry too much. The driverless car will be more convinent for many people. It will be better than riding a bus or taxi because they won't have to wait for a bus or taxi. It will offer more flexibility than a bus. If you were to take a bus you would have to wait for the bus to arrive and with a driveless car you wouldn't have to. It would also use less fuel than a taxi. The driverless car would be safer. They have special sensors that make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. Another reasonn why they would be safe is they are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires hauman skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. The last reason why it would be safer is the driver seats will vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. The last reason why the driverless car would be an excellent idea is the driver will be able to relax without having to worry too much. The driver won't have to worry too much because it will notify the driver when it his or her turn to drive. Another reason is the driverless car will be watching the driver. The driverless car will simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over. Overall, I believe the driverless car would be an excellent idea. It will be more convinent than having to take the bus or taxi. It will also be much more safer than driving a normal car. Many drivers will be about to realax and not worry too much. Imagine everybody having a driverless car and how much safer the world would be."

As a result 70 percent of vaubans families do not own cars and 57 percent sold there car so the could move to there. The good thing is that some people were really tense when they had a car and now they are more happier in there new enviorment.

22099,0,"To whom it may concern, The growing debate on whether or not the electorial college is necessary for when the country is voting for it's president. I am writing to argue that the electorial college is vitial to the presidential election process becuase it evens out the importance of all the states' votes, gives us a certainty of an outcome, and allows for toss-up states to vote for the best candiate.(Posner) It can be precieved that the electorial college is a non-democratic way of voting for the president. Although it may be seen like that, it is in fact favorable towards the people becuase the electors that you indirectly vote for are voting for the same candidate as you were. The electorial college has been around for decaades and has very few times caused a disruption in our country. Why should we eliminate a process that has worked for years and will continue to work for years to come? The electorial college should be kept becuase it allows for the smaller states to compete against the larger states in terms of votes for the presidency. A state like California has a larger population than Alaska so in turn they would have more voters. The electorial college evens out the number of people per state that votes so the candidiate chosen is truly who the country wants as the president. A larger state would also get more attention than a smaller state due to it's size difference. Smaller states would get discouraged and soo only the larger and more populated areas would vote becuase they are getting the most attention from the candidates themselves.(Posner) Our country is made up of fifty states and all of them should have an equal imput in who runs our counrty. Many of the time voters will vote becuase they want to have their party in the president's seat. There are some states that are called swing states that will vote for the president that they beileve will have the best impact on our country reguardless of thei party preference. The electorial college lets the voters from these toss up states vote for the best candidate becuase they are more likely to make thought out decisions because they listen to the candidates proposal and not their party.(Posner) With this in mind, that means that in the end the president chosen is thought to be truly the best winner for the presidency because the toss-up staes chose them over the other. A dispute is possible when the outcome of the president's election is presented. However, it is likely that a dispute will happen if popular vote were to be the process of electing our president. There is very little chances that the electorial college will have a tie and there is the realisation that if popular voting were to happen, there would be more tied elections happenning. The country wants to have certainty when voting for their president and having the electorial college allows for every state to have a definite candidate and in turn the country can have a definite president by the end of the elections. The electorial college is vitial when chosing the presdient becuase it gives us certainty in an outcome, evens out the importance of states votes, and gives swinger states an equal vote as well. We need to keep the electorial college and should it be eliminated, it could put our presidential elections at risk. For decades, the electorial college has worked and our founding fathers believed it was necessary. I implore to you thatkeeping the electorial college is the best for the president's elections. Sincerely, A concerned citizen"

Over the years our generation has developed a lot of cool technology. Sometimes that technoloy has been great but other times it has not been bad. Driverless cars are one of those bad ideas. Driverless cars are a bad idea because they are expensive, dangerous and not practical. Driverless cars are expensive. Instead of inventing smarter cars, many futurists wanted to make smater roads. The futurists would have to destroy all the roads that have already been built and make them more driverless friendly. Instead that money could be used for greater purposes. They also need a lot of sensers to work. Driverless cars are too expensive. Driverless cars are dangerous. Machines are not always perfect. Anything could go wrong. For example in 2013, ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" was announced. This car can drive by itself,but it needs human assistance to navigate through work zones or to brake. If the machine messed up and did not get the attention of the driver, many accidents could happen. Lastly driverless cars are not needed. Our society has ran smoothly for many years with human drivers. If ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" works well, drivers would get bored of waiting for the moment to drive. Younger drivers would not want to read the list of rules of the road. They would think that driverless car would do all the work for them. This could cause a lot of problems we do not need. Driverless cars are expensive, dangerous and are not practical. Maybe if the future driverless cars will be more realistic but for now they are not. Many more problem would arise because of the driverless car. If an acciedent were to occurr who would be blamed?"

Likewise in space exploration, we must be curious about the planet Venus. Venus is a planet that is very similar to Earth in many forms. The reason for studying space exploration is explained in the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"". Although the Venus' conditions are very absurd, but the doors that it can open are well worth the hardwork needed to explore the planet. That is why the author explains that Venus is a planet that is worth exploring due to exploring Venus is able to open more pathways to other types of space exploration and the planet has very close relations with Earth. The author explains that it is true that in order to take step into the future, we must start space exploration. And the only way to do this is to start with a planet close to us. The author tells us that sometimes ""we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus"". If we are so close to Venus what is stopping us from exploring it? There are an abundance of things that stop us form exploring Venus. But the author must first talk about the similarities and differences between Earth and Venus. Earth and Venus are suprisingly very similar in many ways. Due to this fact, Venus can help show us what may happen to Earth in the future. Earth and Venus have very similar ""density and size"". But they are different in that the atmosphere is ""thick"" with ""97 percent carbon dioxide"" and the temperatures of the planet ""average 800 degrees farenheit"". The planet also contains ""highly corrosive sulfuric acid"" and an atmospheric pressure ""90 times greater"" that Earth. This is highly alarming that a planet so close to Earth can also be so different. This sparks a curiosity in the brains of many space passionate people. In culmination, the start of advanced space exploration starts with Venus. It is impossible to be unable to travel to Venus and expect to travel to other places in space. The author wants people to understand that exploring Venus is not pointless, but instead it can answer the many questions we have about our planet. Exploring venus is a challenge that people need to overcome. That is why the exploration of Venus starts a great leap in space exploration."

There should not be driverless cars because driving is a huge responsiblity. I feel that even if the car has an in-car enterainment the driver will not be paying attention to the road and when the car signals for the driver to take control, the driver won't know what is going on and could even cause an accident. Leading to the conflict of who is at fault, ""the driver or the manufacturer?"" If we just keep our cars how they are now people will have to pay attention to the road. You could be paying really good attention to road but you have no idea how the other cars are. A lot of car accidents could be prevented if the driver of the car is in control at all times. People trying to invent a safe driverless car are just wasting their time. Even if the car has a lot of safe reasons in why we should have them there will still be reasons why we shouldn't. We have had total control of our cars for the lonest time now and I feel like it is better to just play it safe and keep doing what we have been doing. It's better to play it safe than to be sorry."
6849,0,"Real or Fake Feelings ""Imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions"" (D'Alto). The article by Nick D'Alto, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" is about a new software, the Facial Action Coding System which can recognize emotions based on muscle movements. Some people think this technology can be useful for many industries, however it can have negative effects on some. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classrom is not valuable. Students may have personal issues and it is not necessary for classroom's to know the emotions an individual is going through. As the article explains how muscle movements connect with how someone feels, it states, ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions---happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness..."" (D'Alto). This demonstrates that the technology can only dectect a few emotions. The technology may get confused and it could determine an incorrrect emotion. The Facial Action Coding System does not offer enough emotions and could therefore make a mistake. In a classroom, students do not need a computer to inform the emotions they feel. Instead, students should learn to communicate how they feel with words. Not every emotion should be shared. They may have a problem at home or could be getting bullied. The emotions shown from the technology will just make the case worse. It is not valuable to use technology to understand emotions of others. When the article explains how every emotion is universal, it states, ""Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion)"" (D'Alto). This statement is not valid because it is not possible to have no emotion. Every thought, question, word, and sentence has emotion. This means the Facial Action Coding System does not have accurate results. A classroom should not have a piece of technology that has no purpose. Teachers should ask for feedback and have students express their emotion whichout a device. Technology should not take over feelings. A computer problem could take away jobs of teachers. The Software will only make things worse in the classroom, which proves it is not useful. The use of the Facial Action Coding System is not vaulable in a classroom because the technology does not provide accurate emotions of students, does not teach students life skills, and it makes the situation worse. Students should focus on communicating with each other and not developing ways for humans and computers to communicate."

Some people think that the face is just a natural form. I agree that it is a natural form, because as the years go by the face changes. And there is no proof that aliens exist. The face on Mars is a natural landform, because it gave the resemblence of an Egyptian Pharaoh. When the picture of the face hit the internet thousands of anxious surfers saw the picture. Not all agreed that the face was made from aliens. The picture just looked like a landform. The picture of the face was taken when it was cloudy on Mars. A mesa or butte is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. That is all my evidence that the Face on Mars is just another landform.

24221,0,"First of all, if i were to inform citizens everywhere about the advantages of car usages, then i'll say this. we find ourselves to go to many different locations by car each day, and what i mean by this is that it is an advantage. while there are many countries who claims that cars are an advantage to us, there are a certain few places and citizens who want to make a change to this. By changing, they mean getting rid of or forbidding the use of cars. to many people, the first step to this is to forbid the uses of street parking, driveways, and home garages. Even though this makes a bit of sense, i believe that a good reason for doing this would be because of the harmful fumes that cars release that pollute the air that we ourselves breathe in. there is also proof for this as well, for example, It's said that in Beijing, China, is known to be one of the most polluted cities in the world. this is a shocking fact. although we recieve this devastating news, i believe that we can make a no-polluting world by not using our automobiles for the time being, i can say that although this might not permenantely make the air cleaner, but we can if we just prevent ourselves from using our cars. Next comes this, we are also aware on how in Bogota, Colombia, that there is little use for cars, since they are only permitting the transport of buses and taxis. however if a violater is caught driving his own vehicle, that person will recieve a $25 fine. there are even a number of people who have claimed that it's a great way to take away stress and lower air pollution. and if this keeps up at an average pace in the next few years, Bogota, Colombia will be confirmed as a clean and non-polluting place. Then comes a known fact of where people are starting to least often drive cars over the past few years, and this has been proven true since many citizens are realizing that it has to be the fact alone on that people are less likely to get their licenses or that they may be dealing with a bit of money trouble, and that the unemployed are less likely to work any longer. Lastly, as it comes all down to these facts, i still believe that we may one day drive our automobiles without doing anything harmful to our enviornment, and at the same time, our automobiles are being useful every single day, since it is another way of getting around to places in where we need to be. such as jobs, going to school, and many more. it may be difficult to believe my opinion on this, but it will get much more simplier as it goes on to progress itself."

6935,0,"Should computers tell us our emotions, or should we know what emotions we have? This is a great question to ask yourself because technology is improving more and more each minute. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", it shows how computers are starting to read/detect how we feel. What about students, should computers be used to tell a students emotion in class? In this short essay I will explain if it should be used and why, lets get started. First of all lets talk about this new technology I'm talking about. Prof has invented a computer system that can read and detect someones emotions, this system is called the Facial Action Coding System. This system detects how you feel through pictures or webcam, for example the famous painting by Leonardo da Vinci, the Mona Lisa. According to the facial system during that moment, Mona Lisa was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry (according to paragraph 1). You may ask youself, how does this system detect a persons emotions? Lets talk about that. First of all a computer constructs a 3-D model of the face. All 44 key muscles from the face must move like human muscles in the model, a movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit."" After that process it goes to a psychologist like Dr.Paul Eckman (creator of Facial Action Coding System) as mentioned in the article. Dr.Paul has classified 6 basic emotions, happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. This is how the whole process works according to paragraph 3 in the article. Now lets talk about the main question I mentioned in the beginning, should computers be used to tell a students emotion in class? The system should be able to tell students emotions in every school in the world, why? Well first of all imagine how easy it would be for a teacher to tell if students actually find the way they teach fun and interesting. Also many teachers ask their students after a lesson if they understand, lots of students say yes but theyre still confused, this system will be so much helpful for both students and teachers. Also as mentioned in paragraph 6, the computer can modify a lesson in a computer to the students liking based on their emotions and face expressions. This system will be so much helpful if we use it in schools today. This is why FACS (Facial Action Coding System) should be used in classes and schools today. In conclusion FACS (Facial Action Coding System) should be used in every school and class. This system has so many advantages for students and teachers around the world. Also the system is improving more and more, imagine how far this system can go and be helpful to schools! Thus in conclusion, FACS (Facial Action Coding System) is a great system and should be used every where."
8485,0,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", the Facial Action Coding System is introduced. It is a new technology that helps computers identify most human emtions. This tehcnology could be of value for students. The Facial Action Coding System can be beneficially useful to read the emtions of students in a classroom to provide insight on how students feel about specific classes and how they react to challenging subjects, and to change the way classes are taught. According to the author, in paragraph four, the Facial Action Coding System can identify various emotions. The software can even identify mixed emotions when people have an expressionless or neutral face. The FACS software has the proper anatomical information for the human body. It can easily identify what a person is feeling even if they have several emotions present at once. In paragraph six Dr. Huang states that a classroom computer with the FACS software could recognize what a student is feeling, whether they are bored or confused. If a computer can identifythe emotions of students in a classroom, then this can be used to make modifications to the lesson or maybe the whole class. For example, if a student is struggling in a certain subject and the computer were to identify the whole classroom as confused or bored then the teacher would have to make improvements to the lesson. This would benefit the students who are feeling lost or bored. If the FACS software could identify the emotions of the student, then this can be used to find improvements for certain classes that students struggle in. In paragraph six, Dr. Huang says that most human communication can be nonverbal. If a student was in a difficult class and was to embarrassed to ask for help, the FACS software has the capacity to identify the precise muscle moevment for the expression of cofusion in that student. Paragraphs seven and eight of the passage describe the small muscle movements made to convey a true smile. The author then goes on to say that these muscles can be spotted to prove whether or not someone is displaying a sincere emotion. Paragraph nine also explains that making a certain facial expression can cause you to feel that certain emotion. The FACS software is advanced enough where it could idnetify if a student is truly confused or not and it can help find new ways to teach by determining the sincere emotion of every student. The article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" introduces the Facial Action Coding System, FACS, that helps identify human emtions. This software can be beneficial in many wyas, such as in a classroom. The Facial Action Coding System can be used to read the emtions of students in a classroom to provide information on how students feel about certain classes and topics and challenges, and to provide on how classes can be taught differently."
6561,0,"Anytime someone goes out in public they are more than likely on camera. Technology is becoming more and more advance every day and it has a lot of good benefits. This article talks about a new technology called the Facial Action Coding system. The use of this technology reading the students expressions in a classroom is valuabe because it can adjust lessons to their need, can tell if something is wrong, and can read almost all emotions they are feeling. The use of Facial Action Coding is valuable in the classroom because it can adjust lessons to the students needs. In the article the author says "" 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.' "" This show that this technology would help all students learn in a way that benefits them and not be confused in class, but afraid to say anything. Each student learns at their own pace and by sitting infront of these computers they can learn and actually enjoy learning. Having this type of technoloy in the classroom is really beneficial because it can tell if something is wrong. In the article it states ""They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one."" This show that if a student in the classroom is being bullied or going through bad things at home the computer can read that and send some type of alert out to the teacher. This benefits the student because they teacher would be able to sit down with them and help figure out a way to solve his/her problems or how to seek help. Using the Facial Action Coding technology in the classroom is very valuable because it can read more than one emotion they are feeling. In the article the author states ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" This shows that when a student sits infront of the computer it will analyze every part of their face to find how much they are feeling of each emotion. Reading all their emotions is quite beneficial because if they suddenly get very angry or sad they teacher could be notified and they could be pulled out of class to ask what is wrong instead of causing a big scene. Finally, the Facial Action Coding may have its flaws, but it comes out on top with pretty good benefits especially for students. Putting this in classrooms could save a lot of bad things from happening and help our sociecty grow stronger and more intelligent. Giving this a try could be the beginning to a new and better future for kids all over."

Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus'd atmosphere. the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 desress Fahrenheit, and the atmosphric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. The NASA is working on the other approachers to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been rested in chamber simulating the chaose of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. the Another project is looking back to an old the technology called mechamical computers. also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating eneavors enseavors. why are sicentists even discussing further visits to its surface? the Astronomers are fascinanted by the vanus because it may well once have been the most earth- like planet in our solar system. long age, the Vanus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth. today, the Vanus still has some features that are analogous to those on the earth. However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can perovide only limited insight on ground conditions because most form of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anythings else, from a distance. many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of venus."

When you want to instail a radio you dont know what you can do about the wires in the car Should you cut that one or should you not. Its just a lot of worries and a lot of what's going to happen to the car. It's nice to know some people are trying to change the world and a lot of people support it.In the story it says that. ""The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph."" What if a person has to get some where why would you want to just go 25 mph. There should be some switch that you can turn on and of so you can drive over 25 mph. they should make a car tht just park for you not one that drives for you. If their going to make a driverless car they might want to make a driverless semi to. They do not know for sure whats going to happen to the car in the real situation on the road. They talk about a ""If the tehnology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the diver of the manufacturer?"". Thats proof that they do not know what is going on and they will some day. But is that day to day that is a question that you ask yourself? They think that they will make a car that is able to drive themselves. If I could i would ask them If they have it done yet. They say that they did not have the technology to do it bace then. That means that they should get the technology and get it right the firs time. Will it make you battery go down faster or will it use more gas. It's harder to make a car that needs a lot of technology than one that does not.

A person would have to stay alert because some cars are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills such as navigating through work zones.

What if technology fails then whats going to happen? BMW says that the car isn't completely driverless you still have to watch the road and stay alert as if you were driving the car. GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the car is in danger and backing into an object. Some other cars simply announces when the driver should be ready to take over the car. It seems like it would be a great thing to have but would have to be more safe. Manufacturers are saying that for the car to be smarter for starters they would need a whole lot of sensors to watch where and what is around the car. In conclusion, No I would not want a driverless car because the car would cause to much trouble and make life harder. Their is to much at risk when getting into the car.

Having technology in a classroom that detects emotions of students can be a new way of learning or can help show how today's technology has advanced. The Facial Action Coding System can help students learn something new: for example the muscles in their faces. The article states, ""your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're surprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger."" The author stated, ""muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus makes crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" This technology can be a very helpful learning system in anatomy or specific jobs like a behavior analysist. During history class, a student might be dozing off or not even paying attention because the topic isn't interesting to him/her, or they don't understand it. Dr. Huang states ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" The Facial Action Coding System can help students learn more effectively, but also make learning fun to them just by the scan of their facial expressions. The text also states, ""Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad. For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" This new technology system can make going to school fun, and can demonstrate where their future has to hold for them. The Facial Action Coding System can be useful any where such as the FBI. Having this new technology system doesn't always help detect emotional expressions, but it can be a new way of learning or can help show how today's technology has advanced and how it is still advancing."

You can still see but not as efectivley as before. You can fix a camera but how much will it cost. What if you sensors malfunction you just lost you're hearig, sence of touch smell taste. How would the car know what to do. the car, blind like a chicken with it head cut off. Unless there is a stearing wheel you can save your self or a emergency hand brake.

2068,0,"venus in one of the brightesrt points of light in the nigt sky, this nickname is misleading since venus is actually a planet, venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. numerous factors contribute to venus reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study. A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus. even more challenging are the clouds of highly carrosive sulfuric acid in venus atmosphere. on the planet superface, temperatures average over 800 800 degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greaer than what we experince on our own planet in ine condition for everyone than humans. the national aeronautics and space administration (nasa) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study venus. the nasa is working on other approaches to studying for example venus study the surfaceand have lasted for there weeeks in such conddition, by comparation, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces. earth and beyond be expanded to meet the very edges of imsginstion and innovation one big example is the exploration of planet vanus"
12027,0,"Do you really think that there is aliens on Mars just because there is a formation of a face landform on Mars? Many people believe that there is other lifeforms living in our solar system like the people who think there are aliens on Mars. These people think this way because there appears to be a landform on Mars that looks like a face, but these people are wrong. The face on Mars is nothing but a natural landform, and just because it is there, does not mean that there has to be aliens up there. The face looking landform on Mars is just a natural landform, and does not mean there is aliens living on Mars. According to the article, it states that, "" it was only another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia"". This proves that this is not the only time this has happened on Mars, and does not mean that there is aliens on Mars just because of a naturally occuring landform. Some people thought is was an alien artifact and that means that aliens had to have lived there. The article states that, "" Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact"". So very few scientists believed this was true, which is not very many, and these are people who studied this for a while and only a few think that aliens are living on Mars because of this landform. Then a man named Jim Garvin took a photo of the landform when he had the chance and also revealed that the Face was just a natural landform. The last paragraph in the article states that the picture shows that these types of landforms are common. So research has told us that this face on Mars is not an alien artifact, but just a naturally occuring landform. There are many reports and research on this topic, but has all lead to the Face just being a landform. There are probably still people who believe in this theory, but they cant see what really is just a landform and not some made up nonsense about how something that looks like a face on a planet means that there had to be aliens living there. That simply does not make sense."
23085,0,"Dear state senator, Electoral Colleges are very important and should be in every ""state"". Electoral colleges are where electors go to meet up and vote for president and vice president. This is a great help because they are more educated in politics than the average citizen is. With the knowledge in politics they can be trusted to make a good decisionon who to vote for. The Electoral College has five hundred thirty eight electors. Each state has an elector for each of the members in the House of Representatives. Not only does each candiddate running for president have their own group of electors, but you will get two of your own. The electors are very hard working also. They have to count all the votes made by congress. If the Electoral Colleges aren't in Florida then who else would want to count all of the electoral votes congress. No one has the time to do that unless it's in their job description. Although an Electoral College can cost a lot of money to build they are still worth it. The bulding of the college will also be beneficial because it causes more jobas for the unemployed. Electoral Colleges are fundamental and will help improve the state's current voting system.

11978,0,"I have to admit, the Face is a really cool thing, but it being made by aliens, come on! It is highly unlikable and unreasonable. The face is a landform that has always been there. There are many factors that go into why the Face could not have been created by aliens. First and foremost, conspiracy theorists have no proof that NASA is hiding that their was even an ancient civilization on Mars. In paragraph five, there was a quote that said, ""... defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" There basically saying that an ancient civilation would have benefited NASA, if they had actually found one. If there was an ancient civilization people would have found out about it already. In paragraph seven, on April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia and Michael Malin, with his Mars Orbiter Camera, took pictures of the the original Vikings photo that were ten times sharper. The new photos revealed a natural landform. The camera quality was poor in the original photo in 1976. That explains why the landform appeared to look like a face. As time past and technology improved, NASA was able to make out that the face was an illusion from bad camera quality. Going along with the previous paragraph, people believe that the cause for the landform in the photo, in 1998, to not have a face is because of aliens! In paragraph eight, the camera, that they used to take the photo with, had to peer through clouds to see the Face. People believed that the clouds were created by aliens so that they could hide the Face. I do admit that clouds could have affected the photo, but they were clearly wrong. In the ninth paragraph, on April 8, 2001, The Mars Global Surveyor took another photo in the camera's highest resolution on a cloudless day, and once agian, the picture revealed a natural landform. With most of the information in the article, I can conclude that the Face was just a picture that created controversy because of its uniqueness. I mean, it was a face on Mars! It was taken a long time, with poor camera quality, causing the landform to look like a face. It was a misconception that affected our viewpoints on NASA and influenced many aspects of our Entertainment."

This can really change us in school and better educated. I believe that we should have the Facial Action Coding System. If we were in our classroom, the teacher can't sometimes tell if your really happy, bored, mad, or sad. If you learning something in class and the computer shows that youre bored. The can help you get motivated and try harder on your homework. Sometimes students comes in and just smile, but really you don't really know how they feeling. On paragraph 8, its says that sometimes there face isn't saying the truth becuase deep down there hurn or just lying. There trying to hide there emotions. The teachers really need to how they feeling. Like in paragraph 6, it says that it can detect if a students was feeling bored, sad, fearful. What if they were depressed or mad at something? We have to do something and help them. This can really benifent our school and our students. I would really value this computer system, becuase it can help our education better and more efficient.

13937,0,"People should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program for three reasons. The reasons for thinking this are: you would be able to help people in need, visit unique places, and care for animals. The first reason for participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program is that you would get to help people in need. The UNRRA is there to help recover food supplies, animals, and more. The Seagoing Cowboys were hired to take care of animals sent over seas for the people in need. Participating in the Seagoing Cowboys gives you the oppurtunity to help people start a new better life after distruction. The second reason for participating in the Seagoing Cowboys is that you get to visit unique places. Luke states ""Besides helping people, I had the side benifit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special. So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water."" Luke got to go to those unique places. He also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China the article states. If you participate in the Seagoing Cowboy program you might get the chance to visit some unique places. The third and final reason you should join the Seagoing cowboy program is that you would get to care for the horses, young cows, and mules that are being shipped overseas. You would be kept busy while you were on your way to your destonation. You would have to feed and water the animals two or three times a day. You would also have to get the bags of hay and bags of oats from the lower holds of the ship. If you like animals and to take care of animals you would enjoy this. In conclusion, participating in the Seagoing Cowboy program would let you help people, take care of animals, and visit unique places."

Back then you didn't have to worry about gas prices or anything like that. In this generation everyone think's the only way they can get where they want to go is by driving a car,when that really isn't the case. Driving in this generation can be fun, but can also cause a lot of disadvantages. Cars can be very dangerous and cause a lot of damage in this world. Right when you get in your car and start driving around you are poluting the air. There's so pollution in this world and cars are making it worse. The world use to be clean before cars came around cars are taking over people and their lives. Cars cause a lot of accidents. Every second of everyday there is an accident and people are loosing their lives because of it. People don't take driving seriously at all. If we didn't have cars there would be no accidents happening. No one would be driving under the influnce and having to worry about getting in the car and driving home. If we all walked we would be getting our excercise and not have to worry about loosing a life. I think we should go a week without driving a car and see how everyone likes it. Yes, the sidewalks will be packed but when you drive you have to deal with traffic. Another thing is that you don't have to worry about wasting your money on gas. I think this world would be a better place with less cars and more walking."
4117,0,"Venus is a well knowin planet in the atmosphere. For being the hottest planet even though it's not even the closet to the sun. It's also shaped just like earth they are very simular in so many ways, they weigh close to the same also it very easy to notice even amateur stargazers can find it. People want to explore it but they can't because Venus is very dangours to land on like the tempature is to hot at 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheic pressure is 90 times greater that what we expeience on our own planet, and has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. NASA has even tryed to land a spacecarft on Venus but no spacecarft survived the landing for more than a few hours, maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched on Venus in more than three decades. Hopefully one day we can find away to land and stay on Venus. But like the article says, maybe if we hoover above it we can get close enough to see what is happening. And what we need to do for us to land there and surive the carbon filled palnet. But if it was me i thank we should stop thinking about other palnets and think about our own. We have a stable place to live the only thing they are going to do i they send someone to Venus is kill them the conditions ae to dangrours and NASA knows that. People always think stuff needs to be done fast but they are not the ones doing it. NASA is trying so hard to make it on Venus and hopefully they do one day even if it's thousands of years away. But in conclusion NASA is a place filled with very smat people and if anyone can do and it's them."
7690,0,"How would you feel if their was a computer watching you as do your work? Do you think that would be weird and maybe even uncomfortable? Well, that is what would be happening if their were computers that read your expressions. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" Dr. Huang and Dr Eckman have developed a system that does so. The use of this technoogly to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable. First of all, the article states that ""Eckman has six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger disgust fear and sadness..."". If a computer was to detect any of these emotions from a student while he or she is working there wouldn't be an easy way of knowing whether the student is struggling or if the student is doing just fine. This quote from ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" shows how FACS (the Facial Action Coding System) won't necessarily be valuable to students when they are in their classrooms working. Secondly, from ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" states ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile"". The computers students use at home could be the same as the computers they do there work on during class. By saying this there is a possibility that FACS won't even work for styudents when there at school doing work. The quote used above shows that you cant count on FACS to be available for the use of students in class. Lastly, from the article ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them"". If a student had FACS on there computer and they were doing there work in class and they smile because another student did something nice for them, and FACS detected them smiling and then modified their work that could be a bad thing. It could be a bad thing if the student was doing their work and they actually didnt understand what they were doing and now that FACS detected them smiling they are now doing harder work which is a detriment to the student. This quote shows that having FACS on a students computer while they are working in class could be bad. In conclusion, having the FACS technolgy on a students computer while they are working at school in their classroom is not valuable. The article does not give any examples or ocurrances of the technology to read a students emotions of having any good outcomes. The use of FACS could incorectly detect wether a student is having trouble or not, it only detects basic emotions, and it may not even be available to the use of students depending on the type of computer they use in their classroom."
82,0,"The Challenge of Exploring Venus, is a very detailed, reliable article. It seems as though the author thinks it would be a good idea to find a way to have an exploration take place on our neighboring planet, Venus. In the authors final paragraph they state that ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" wich strongly indicates that the author thinks it would be good to invest in such an exploration. For the most part the author supports his idea well but there are some parts of this article that could possibly make some readers confused. In most of the paragraphs of this exerpt the author is stating the danger that is involved in making an exploration to Venus. As much as the author states towards the beggining and end of the article how they beleive it would be a worthy pursuit, for most of the body paragraphs they dont seem too optimistic about the exploration. For example in paragraph 2 the author says that Venus is,""a challenging planet for humans to study "". Another example from paragraph 4,""The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive?"". These types of remarks seem slightly reoccuring in this exerpt. They also show that the author seems like they have alot of doubt in NASA's capability to continue with such a major journey. The writer of this article was very knowledgable about the terms and conditions of mars,and what it would take to be able to do research on the planet itself. The majority of this exerpt consists of diffrences and similarities that venus and our home planet, Earth, have. For example in paragraph 2 the author exclaims that the two planets are referred to as ""twins"". An example of how they were contrasted, in paragraph 3,""On the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" As you can see, the detailed facts in this exerpt are clearly reliable. As much as it may be controversial, because the author did show alot of negative effects to exploring Venus, they did bring up some reasons how it could be a good idea to make an exploration like this, considering how alot Venus and Earth are. For example in paragraph 4, the author states,""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.""""Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth."" These examples show that the author is guving strong reason why it would be possible to make a expidition to Venus. The article, The Challenge of Exploring Venus, is very detailed, factual, and strong. Although it may not 100% express that the author is trying to say it would be a worthy pursuit to make an expedition to Venus, this article still would give people alot of information on Venus and reasons why we should or should not go there. This exerpt does express that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers, for the most part. It may show more of the dangers and not as much why it would be worthy, but at some parts it does show that it would be a good idea. Some readers might be confused about weather the author thinks its worthy or not, but either way it is still very factual and a strong article to get a lot of information from."
379,0,"Venus is often referred to as Earth's ""twin"" planet based on its density and size. And in some cases it is even the closest planet to earth. We only have minimal information on Venus because the hospitable conditions are not preferable for humans. In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author makes a strong argument or claim that, despite the dangers, Venus would be beneficial for humans to study. The author talks about the similarities Venus has to Earth, the technology needed to look at Venus more closely, and the benefits of knowing more about Venus. In the second paragraph the author analyzes the similarities that Venus and Earth have together. He/She states that, ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."" Because it is a neighboring planet and it is so similar to Earth, humans have been determined to find out more about Venus than what we know now. Humans have sent space crafts to land on Venus and retrieve data, but the durability of the space crafts is not strong enough for it to withstand the intense conditions of the planet. In the article, the author also talks about the technology needed to evaluate the planet more closely. In paragrpah seven he/she states ""... some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" This is very beneficial for us because if we can use this technology to explore Venus, then we can find out more about the planet while staying protected from the harsh conditions as well. Staying safe is a must when it comes to exploring a new planet, but what is all of this hard work for anyways? The author, in paragraph four says, ""... recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel."" What if, in the future, we could travel to Venus just to look around. Wouldn't that be amazing? Here, the author is saying that there is so much to be gained if we were able to visit Venus. He/She also backs this up in paragraph eight stating, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on this planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" Finding a safe way to explore our neighboring, and ""twin,"" planet would benefit us as humans because we would no longer have to wonder or imagine what other planets are like. We would already know, thanks to the development of new satisfactory technology. In the article, the author makes a strong claim that, despite the dangers, Venus would be beneficial for humans to study."

23515,0,"Have you ever thought about why there are so many deaths in the world? Most leading deaths are from vehicles and the driver behind the wheel, wether they are texting, talking on the phone, or under the influence. I believe it is a great thing to live in a city where car usage is very limited. Living in a world where everyone has to walk or ride a bike to go from place to place also means that everyone gets their daily exercise. Today, in society people are usually sitting in a car, others they ride a bike or take a walk. While doing these activities you have to worry about anything hitting you, for this instance a car. What I am trying to say here is less people die as less people drive. Another reason to limit car usage is weather patterns. You never know what the weather is going to be like, therefore you will never know what you might run into. There have been some cases for pile-ups from smog. smog is a mixture of smoke and fog, making it impossible to see. Diesel fuel doesnt help the case for smog either. The diesel helps the smog by polluting the air around the area. In Bogota Colombia, a program that is set set to spread to other countries. This program is called ""Car-free day"", millions of Colombians hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work during this day. This day also brings avoidment to traffic jams. Some citizens say it is a good way to lower air pollution. Less car usage is helping to clean the air. This generation needs to understand that if we want a clean future for ouselves and our families. President Obama has a goal to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions. Recent studies shows that Americans are buying fewer cars and getting fewer licenses as the years progress. It is said that the number of miles driven in the U.S. peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter. Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company says ""as of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly nine percent blow the peak and equal to where the country was in January of 1995"". Some people have cars and the rarely use them, living in big cities where taking a bus or riding a bike would not be necessary if having a car. Some other things why limiting car usage is a good thing is gas prices, they are so overated now. Gas used to be.97 cent per 9/10 a gallon. Now, you cant find a gas station anywhere without the ranging prices of $2.45-$3.75. That price is ridiculous, who wants to pay $37 for 10 gallions of gas? I sure dont, that is another reason why some people find it easier to ride a bike. They save money! Yes, I understand that the economy is bad. Bad to the point where i do not feel like going anywhere anymore? Things are changing in this world and it needs to continue."
24576,0,"Dear (Senator of Florida), In my opinion I believe the electoral college shall not remain the same and that we should change the election to the popular vote. I believe that the electoral college and the process in which it takes for a president to get elected isn't fair. Like stated in the article if you lived in Texas and wanted to vote for 'John Kerry' you would also be voting for his slate of 34 Democratic electors which would gain him 34 electoral votes. The electors could be anyone depending on what state it is and not always can voters control whom their electors vote for. Sometimes people don't know or get confused about the electors and vote for the candidate the was possibly not in their favour. A negative aspect of the Electoral college is that you can be off for about one vote or so and if the other candidate looks like it has majority they would give it to them. Sometimes they have to recount votes and check over them again because they are unsure or have new votes coming in. The worst thing is when you have a tie in the electoral college which is possible it rarely ever occured in the popular vote. In the popular vote you either win by majority or lose because you didn't have enough votes or more votes than your opponent. The electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winner take all system that in each state the candidates on go to the states in which they believe that they have a strong amount of votes. The electoral college is agreed to be unfair, irrational, and outdated. In order for the country to continue growing and increase in the economy and so forth you don't need a president who is the most liked you need one who you believe will run the country and be able to fulfull the demands you would like for the country. Romney had most of the south votes yet Obama still won the election due to his excellence in presidency and the small states and a few large states added up together to let him win. Just becasue a president has over rule on the South states or north doesn't mean they are guaranteed to win the election. I believe in my opinion it isn't true that a large state gets more attention in a campaign than the smaller states because Obama went to small states and large states to campaign in not just the large states. Going back to Romney who went to the southern states and fairly larger states to receive majority vote. So due to the fact that there are many downsides to the electoral college I say it shall be abolished and that the popular vote from now on shall determine whether you are president or not."

There is no way the face on marse's surface was made by aleans because we have photographic images that prove so, and by telling it was made by alien it would just help us. So if you really think that that the alience made the face on mars then you don't know any of the facts. First of all we have the picktures to prove it. So maybe the first one wasn't as clear becaus of the times, but the next one was ten times better. It doesn't sound like a lot but for what the first one looked like was like eating fake oreos to the real ones. But that was on a cloudy night and because it was you still don't belive it. So we went and took an other one (even thought it was hard sence we dont pass it very often). Nevertheless we got it in all of its NON alian glory. With the next picture we got in 2001 you have to belive us that it was a rock. It was 43 meters per pixel compared to the first that was 1.56. If you dont know what that means then let me just tell you it was way better. Also why would we ruin a great oportunity like that. If we had said it was from alien we would have goten so much money. Imagen all the questions that would have been asked that we might have not have been able to answer on earth. People would start demanding their questions be answed and we would not be able to do it. So we ask for money we would get the best to make it posible for us to get to the red planet and boom we are on mars and we make an other small step. So if you want to look stupid and belive that the aliens made a face on mars then do so, but the facts are that there is not one. We have pictures and a want to go to mars that wont happen to prove it. And if after all that you dont belive me then writ your own paper convincing everyone it is a alian made Mount Rushmore and maybe NASA will Get to go to mars sitting on a rock."

"" Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 metters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 viking photo."". That is saying that they got a better camrer, its can see more thing that the other camera could not see. This is another example that the camera can see that the other camera could not see. "" So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"". that us saying that it can focus from farther distance. The last thing I will tell you is what they found out about the picture they took with the better camera and to see if it was ture or not. That the ""Unmasking the Face on Mars."". Was created by aliens or the shadow was making it look like a face. "" What the picture actually shows in the Martian equivalent of a butte mesa."" In conclusion all of this ""drama"" was for nothig becuas it was not created by aliens it was just mother nature that did all of this. All it was the shadow that maked it looked like it had a face."

Driverless cars are going to be made with sensors and computers. Sensors will be linked to the internet. What happens if the internet fails while the car is in motion? It will cause all types of commotion between the drivers and the manufacturing companies. The use of driverless cars will only effect the human race not help it. It will create all types of saftey concerns. Who will pay for all of the damage it is likely to cause? As far as researchers on the cars' evedience it has presented in the story, the car is not trustable. They can't even fully work without a human. The fact that these cars will be able to run off the internet won't quite cut it for me. Many times while surfing the web the internet crashes and you have to start all over. Whose to say that while the driverless car is driving the internet won't crash. While the car has to systematically reboot, how does anyone know it won't speed up and potentially harm someone or create a massive accident? Using the internet based solely for these cars would be a huge mistake. As the text states ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-- the driver or the manufaturer?"" With no one knowing who to blame, how will the cost of any damage be payed? I believe that if any damage of property, death, or harm of a person should come from driverless cars that the manufactures should pay for it. Thats only my opinion. But others may think different. It may cause a lot a conflict between companies and civilians. No one could take responsibility of anything that happens with a driverless car. Researchers say that driverless cars are still not even fully driverless. They need help with certain situations such as parking, traffic issues, and navigating through accidents. If a driverless car can't hadle parking or navigating it way through traffic, how will it manage to drive on expressways, across train tracks, and even on regular streets. The story and researchers themselves have prove that this car will not be able to face driving on its own. My opinion still stands as no, driverless cars should not be allowed. Evidence from the text such as the car being based on internet, not knowing who to blame if accidents occur, only proves that it would be very irresponsible to put these cars on our streets. Driverless cars would only add to the problems of our world. If these cars are put on the streets, how long will it be before they kill someone? Driverless cars are a completely bad idea."

What if all we needed was a good source of public transportation. Cities aroud the world are doing just that, private motor transportation has a lot of cons. Smog in big global cities is building up more and more enviormental issues are becomeing big problems due to the rutine use of cars. Traffic jams and overcrowding of roads is also another big problem. There are many ways us as humans are trying to cut down on our use of private motor transportation that benefit us in so many ways. When everyone in a big city such as Parris for example uses their own cars to go from place to place they put harmful gasses into the atmosphere. After a while of everyone driving in a big city like paris the gases and smog build up and polute the air. Parris is one of the cities trying to dramaticly cut down the use of cars and provide easy to use and affordable public transportation. Public transportation cuts down the amount of people on the road and positively impacts the enviorment and the air aroud the city. Traffic jams and overcrowding of road ways prevents the use of cars to acheive its full potential. For every person that uses public transportation that is on less car on the roads if everyone in a city such as Bogota, Colombia where to stop all useage of privte motor vheciles the amount of traffic jams and overcrowding would decrease dramaticly. People in Bogota, Colombia are doing that very such thing every year the city bans all non public transportion vheicles and requires all residents to find their own way to comute to where they need to go this has been going on for three straight years now ""It's a good opportunity to tke away stress and lower air pollution"" says businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza. We as humans are always on the move but some of the ways we get from place to place may not be beniffical to us overtime. The good thing about this is that goverments in cities and countrys around the world are finding bennifical ways to comute other than driving your own vheicle. Since 2005 the amout of people on the road in the U.S has droped significantly and continues to drop every year. Public transportation and better laid out city plans are helping this drop in the usage of cars. Cars get us from place to place but it would be nice if one day we wouldnt have to worry about the usage of cars i our world. With all of the banifits of not continuisly driving the world would be such a better place. One day this dream for many will become the way we all learn to live. Non reliant on private transportation."

The author is saying that often referred to as Earth ""twin"", Venus is closest plant to Earth in terms od denstily and size, and occasionallly the closest in distance too. Many this explains why not a single spaceship has touched to Venus in more than three decades. Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as challenging plant for humans to study, despite its proximity to us. I think that the author is supports he's idea that we should studyed Venus. This is my evidence "" On the plant's surface, temeperatures avaerage over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own plant"", he is talking about how the temperatures are dangers and that is on eof the things their going to challenge.

Computer are the future,but is it for cars. Computer driven cars can be quiet dangerous. What if the car malfuntions. Feor example, your driving in the woods heading for your camping spot, but the car dosen't want to turn. Your heading for a tree and you cant pull the stearing wheel what happens next? Or what if your car is bieng hacked by an unkown person. how would the car company fix it. Will they make new driving laws? As stated in the story""New laws will be in order to cover liability in case of an accident"". ""Who is held responsible the driver or the manufature"". In the story it states ""Presntly, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the safe car has a human driver in controlat all times"". I know here already tired of the regular driving laws. If computer driving cars are so safe why is it illegal? in the story it states ""As a result in most states it is illegaleven to test computer-driven car."" That dosent sound safe to me. It also states ""manufatures believe that more states will follow as soon as the cars are proven to be mor reliably safe."" meaning that there not safe now. Still think that computer driven cars are still safe? i didnt because of my three reasons. What if the car malfuntions or get hacked? Will they make new laws? If it is safe why is it illegal?"
1271,0,"The Challenge of Exploring Venus Is it worth it to study venus despite the dangers it presents? Well in my opinion, it is a good idea, to explore more planets to see what they have and don't have. This passage includes information about exploring venus and its dangers it has of exploring it. In my opinion the author supports this idea with lots of ideas and detail. Like "" Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. Or "" (NASA) has one particular compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of venus would allow sicentist to float above the fray. Solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans. However, looking at venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions. Researchers cannot take samples of anything in the planet because its unreachable at the moment. So they will not be able to do this until they have better equipment. Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus. In conclusion, its a good idea to study venus and everything it has."
11970,0,"My position on driverless cars are that we should not trust them as much as they say we should. Regauredless what the compony says about the safty features, car do amd will always mess up in some way. Which will come to the point of who's fault was it in the first place. The compony not meeting thier standards or the buyer not watching the road. Some reasons a disagree with the driverless cars are because of the roads. Most roads these days are being redone or having construction builders on them all the time. As it says in paragraph 2 ""dealing with traffic issues, such as difficult roadwork or accidents caome be a complication for the car."" These car will have no idea when a crash will occur and when it does happen will the driver be able to control the car in the small amount of time that it has to move? Knowing the driver of the car will be very important to have the car. Knowing how it works and all of the safty procations will have to be known imediately. The driver may rely to much on the car's safty and let it drive them. In my opinion the call will be asisting the driver not driving for it. Making sure the driver still keeps his hands on the wheel and taking proper precations will be very esintual for the car. The BMW that was announced in 2013 told the people what they wanted to here and told them the core standards of the vehical. Here is some details about the car, ""The car can handle speeds up to 25mph, with special touch sensors to make sure the drver keeps his/her hands on the wheel while in motion. When the car needs human asistance the seat will vibrate to get the drivers alertness to take over for navigatio."" some of those features have been thought through, but it dosent mean they are 100% protective and safe. These car's for the future are all around great ideas but they are not ready for drivers in this era. Too many careless drivers and wrecks happen to often, with ""robots"" driving would just be even more dangerous for the people around us and thier safty."
22260,0,"The main topic of this story is that the Electoral College are not making votes fair for other people. So i will tell them what is really going on with the U.S. To begin with, I personally think the Electoral College should change because over the years after people voted it seemed they wanted to change it, so they decide to cause a riot around there city, maybe the U.S. Some people do not like how the Electoral Law is set for our U.S. My opinion is that some of the people running for presidents usually get helped, not only by us, but by other members of the Electoral Collage. As you see the evidence is how you turn on the T.V at night and see what is going on with the vote and election. For example Afganiscan, they are destroying there country becuase of how much they dislike our president, because of a unfair vote. Think about it would any of this happen if the Electoral College made things fair with making people at least vote twice? As you see how other people are getting deeply hurt of what you are doing. Now am not asking you to abuse this opinion just to make people happy, but the main topic of what i am writing you is to think and observe around you. According to everyone else opinion, i am not only speaking for me now, but people are thinking to redo the election. People all country would like to vote for the same president of the U.S i know there are some states that have a president but like im saying, they want to change that. People can see that its up to us to choose who is president, but its not the members of the Electoral College job to add more credit to the person losing or winning. People are dieciding to make plans because they do not get things there way. Just like the riot in paris with the terriots, there had to be a reseason for it. Think about it why would terriots want to kill people? Not only for fun but because of the presidential voting. Every bad thing on the U.S is mainly about voting. Just like people holding up signs on the street to change there election. As you can see the Electoral College is really selfish. They tend to pay more attensiion to themselves but not others. They do it for the money and the fact to usually get other people upset. The presidents that the Electoral Collage want to win they win. Its a fact that most presidents win to easy. They win with a plethora of help, not only with the U.S but with the members of the Electoral Collage. In Conlusion, the electoral colage has to think about other people. They ned to focus more on the atmoshpere then sitting in one small room thinking about themselves."
21283,0,"In Vauban, Germany, citizens have made the decision to not use cars. To some people, this may be something that they could never imagine themselves doing, becuase it would make life more complicted. However, these people are pleased with their decision and would not have it any other way. Furthermore, there are many advatages to making this change. By limiting car usage, citizens can improve their own health and economic state. By making the decision to stop using cars, one can become healthier, both mentally and physically. One citizen who has already taken this step said,""'When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way'"" (Rosenthal 3). Many people who chose to limit their car usage, decided to walk or ride bikes instead. By chosing the alternative, they are less stressed. There is something soothing about walking down the road in a quiet and peaceful environment. Walking gives one time to reflect and think, while driving requires concentration and can be stressful. In addition to improving one's mental health, limiting car usage can also improve one's physical health. Pollution from the air can take a tolll on someone's physical health and the environment around them. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"" (Rosenthal 5). Pollution poisions the air of most cities where people live and breathing the pollution is not healthy for an individual. In cities like Beijing, inhabitants wear air filters over their mouths in hopes fo escaping the pollution. Limiting car uage can help improve air quality quickly. For example, after having multiple days of intense smog, Paris decided to ban cars with even-numbered plates for one day. After this one day of limited car usage, ""the smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday"" (Duffer 19). Another advantage to limiting cars is that it could mean economic improvememt for individuls and countries. The banning of cars can mean improvement in the appearance of cities, which can have positive impacts on the economy of cities. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; unevem, pitted sidewalks have beeen replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks"" (Selsky 28). These improvements in the city can draw more people to them and stimulate the economy in places that have had difficulty before. In addition, individuals can save money by carpooling, biking, walking, or using public transit as an alternative optopn to driving. During the 2013 rececession, people were forced to sell their cars due to lack of money. However, after they recovered from this, they decided not to return to car usage due to their content in the lifestyle they had chosen (Rosenthal 32) In conclusion, limiting one's usage of cars can have only positive impacts on one's life. This decision can have lasting impacts one's happiness, the environment, and the economy."
18884,0,"Do you ever dream about the world having driverless cars everywhere? Well google thinks so. Google and many others like me think that there can be driverless cars everywhere they go to get people around more safely than a human driver can ever imagine. I think that this is a great idea to begin with because of the fact that there are lots of accidents caused by human error when it comes to driving. Driverless cars can be benetfical towards a lot of things like for an example, senior citizens who are too old to drive anymore and the handicap people who got an injury that prevents them from driving. It can also be more quicker also than a taxi or bus for the public who normally complain about the buses and taxi's running late. The cars can change the world as we know a world with no worries of an problem with car accidents. Please don't worry people the car's have sensors that are always on alert scanning around the car sending 3D models of the things around it to be aware. The sensors came a long way from back then and now even today being made way better than before with faster scanning and alertness with this happening you can bet on it that driverless cars will be a success. But others are concerned with the computers in the car saying what if the computers crash or if it gets hack they are also saying that what if there is an incident who will be to blame will it be the passenger or the manafacturer. There are a lot of what if but the time of driverless cars is very close and can be happenning in some years to come."
9910,0,"I personally believe its time for a step foward into the future of technology, but are driverless cars really the step foward we want to take into it? Sure the idea of a driverless car seems cool but there are way to many possible issues going into this. Including the expensises, the dangers it could possibly put on humans, and technology malfunctions that might occur. Manufacturing driverless cars are going to be way to costly. Considering almost all car parts and almost everything is made in China America is only going to only put ourselves further in debt than what we already are. Not to mention the industry proably wouldnt be making much off these cars because, middle class people would not be able to afford these cars. Heres a Scenerio, your sitting in the drivers seat of your driverless car, off gaurd because the car dosen't need your assistance. An accident occurs quick no one saw it coming, it just happens. How quick is the cars reacting time in telling you that it needs your assistance? How quick is your reaction time? Do you even have time to react or is to late? Then the issues of the cost repairing your car. Who's fault it isthat you were involved in the accident the car or you? Problems that have been popping up in the car bussiness is that cars havent been being manufactured properly. If car manufactures cant make a basic, modern day car correctly, what makes one think theyre going to manufacture a way more advanced car correctly. Do we even have all the technology to make sure that this driverless car is going to be safe and effective? Also manufactures are going to need to be perfecting more than just the cars, they need to think about, the roads, cars that arent driverless and other factors, instead of jumping the gun and assuming we are ready for driverless cars. The idea of driverless cars are somewhat satisying to think about and to imagine. Sadly i dont think its something that we as a country are ready for. I think that alot more test and researching needs to be put into this, and we need to get ourselves out of debt, before we go doing things that are only going to futher us into it."

More and more people are taking public transportation, walking, and biking. smog and polution are coating our cities like a blanket. ""Passenger cars are resonsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. Up to 50% in car intensive areas around the U.S. '' says source 1. There is an experimental town in Germany, named Vauban, whose streets are filled with people instead of cars. This seems to be the growing trend, a movement, called ""smart-planning''. As cars decrease, the city of Vauban is more compact. They no longer have a worry about where to set parking. Stores are set on main roads, no longer having a mall on the side of a congested highway. Everything's just a simple walk away. Things are simple here, and air is clean. Unlike Vauban, France had to take things to a new level. As smog layed heavy over Paris, a driving ban was set to clear the air. Though congestion was down 60% in the capital, cold nights and warm days caused a layer of air to trap car emissions. Diesel fuel was blamed in this case, the tax policy made by France, favors diesel over gosoline. ""Deisels make up 67% of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3% average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe"" says source 2. As France set a ban on cars for a little while, America seems to be just losing intrest in motor vehicles.

The author describes the differences between them and the number of spacecrafts that the humans have sent and why none of them havent touched the planet, Venus.

Many researchers are working on inovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus. Both planets, Earth and Venus had good similarities like the Oceans and the valleys. I think thats why the researchers want to keep studying and make new machines that can support Venus conditons.

24613,0,"Today in the world, are you happy? Happy with how the world is growing up and acting or ashamed on how it is pleading to those who live in it to finally change for the better which isn't happening. Yet some children of mother nature or of the universe do believe that only living off of the non-materialistic ideas in life can help you get farther. However many people take pride in indulging on the sins that used excessively can't get them out of the hole they were forced into. Sterotypical people who contradict themseleves or those whom tend to be hypocrytes for that they don't understand always fail to stand for the better. I believe, that in all honesty, no one should be happy with the location of where they stand in society. Due to how far technology has gotten not even within the past two centuries, it must be stopped as a whole. Now let's actually discuss our main objective to throw out the window. The topic to fully dive into, based upon facts and personal opinions, Can stopping the mechanical reproduction of automobiles truly help the world out? Just think about it, what are the possibilies that are being entitled within this topic in particular; but most importantly is there any way the upcoming generations can switch everything or everyone around, to change the mindset of all of the billions of people living on the planet to make it up for the better since we all know the way we are heading is not the place we should go? How fast or slow can this idea be put into place? The world we now know is indeed needing to be resureccted based alone on how much harm we have caused within the past few centuries. If you rely on technology too much doesnt that hurt yourself even more in the long run? Strategies or new found plans should be taken into consideration based on the facts presented and dismissed in the past because the way we are living and teaching those those who are newly born, should know that the world around them isn't right anymore, and direly needs help to improve. The society we are now dealing with, needs to play a new game or the world will end in more corruption than originally thought would happen. In all, isn't it good sometimes, to think about what is wrong and what you could do to help out? Now just sit and think to see where your own mind could lead you. Down the path were the world is once again healthy and happy? Or the path of destruction? The path of destruction can lead to many implications based on health, or survival of the fittest, based on social status or skills gained in a hard cold world mostly dependent on how or when you grew up, due to how society changes over time. Scientists know based on their own work that the atmosphere can only handle so much pollution until it gives out and the world as we do know, learn, and live with can die. Do you want to see the slow demise of where you live, the place where is the only home known to man of the human species? Seeing death upon the streets due to failing natural health means, does it not actually hurt the heart to see such things? Plus car's do take too much space needed for other necesisties such as more room or storage to live a basic daily life in. Yes we may have the technology to fix natural things artificially but does it make it right to think that it will work? Cars cause pollution, pollution cases for health issues, health issues lead to over crowding at the hospital with disease, work load increases and those who work will tire and then eventually get sick themselves for which the most able to achieve end for this ongoing process could be death. Now do you understand where I might be getting at? Being sick mentally or physically is just the first step into a change in mind where all can go to hell and break loose or done in a good way, could change the future generations to restart where we all began. This is all just the basics of the wrong path imagine what could happen if nothing is done to stop the hurting and resume the healing. Although that is the begining of an era that could happen due to stupidity or greed could you do us all a favor and imagine a realistic dream of what could happen if we dropped technology as a whole? All the metals could be recycled for greater purposes! Cars will lead us to see a whole new or happier society where socializing could be the end of all problems. Our health will be in tip top shape, everyone will finally understand what it could mean to live in harmony. Money not spent on transportation could be saved for greater purposes similar to expenses for your child's college maybe even for the advancement of useful environmentally friendly sciences to be learned or help funded or whichever other purpose you can think of. Yes one bad point is that many jobs could be lost but there is always back up plans that you could create for the worst case scenario. However, otherwise society will be happy and health issues should decrease if many of us chose to instead walk or use a bicycle to our destination, so isnt that a better dream to dream? ""Keep Moving forward"" as stated by Walter Disney, can that dream not be achieved by any means to increase the chances of a world where anything is possible to demand or chase after? Failure doesnt mean to give up but to rather keep trying to improve the ratio of failing to succeding. Cars may be important now, but in an alternate universe, what if they were never invented? In conclusion these familes who are giving up their main source of transportation unless required, they are doing the right thing by taking the first step into a new way of life. Giving up cars is giving up the chance to accidentally hurt those by made a bad desicion. Althought depleting these choices of actions will or should decrease if this topic remains to be included as a new trend for a lack of better word majorly helpful to whose with crime records of the possibility of earning. Fighting with reason is better than to not fight at all. If your standing and doing nothing to help the environment around you, then don't you think you should consider the consequences for future generations down the road? Consider both sides of the argument, which is right or which is wrong to proceed with? The happier life versus the hurting of the world? I can only do nothing but act upon myself to show that what is going on is a coincidence merely to the fact that you are here reading my words. Can my words help from afar or not at all can only be determined by yourself. So be wise and consider, do you chose left for healing or right for hurting?"

If their having problems with the Electoral College they should just take it out completly. Who wants to have a run off election it just waistes time. In the paragraph Avoid Run-Off Elections it says ""The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast"". Thats like saying they woulden't even care is the candidate had no majority votes in the cast. Another example is ""There is pressure for run off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast"". Of course theirs pressure because they do anything right. Thats why i thing they should change to election by popular vote for the president of the united states."
9225,0,"I personally think that the use of the Facial Action Coding System can be a valuable addition to students in classrooms, I think this way because the technology can help kids out who are having issues in the classroom learning. The Facial Action Coding System developed by Prof. Thomas Huang of Beckman Institute in the Univerity of Illinois, is a new facial scanning piece of technology that is able to tell what emotions you are feeling. The system does this by scanning all 44 muscles of the face and tells which ones have moved in which direction that show a certain emotion. This can be helpful for classrooms that use technology in a big way. The way this can help is that it can tell if students are enjoying the learning activities they are doing by telling it's emotion. Lets say a computer activity is being preformed at a school and one of the students is not enjoying this activity. The computer, (using Facial Action Coding System) helps by giving the teacher a signal that one of the students is experiencing unhappy emotions. The teacher then helps out the student and tries to make his learning experience better. That is the valuable way in my opinion, as to how the facial scanning system can be used in classrooms. In conclusion, I think that Prof. Huang's technology can help out and be valuable to classrooms by tailoring student's online activities in the way that they please so that they can pass assignments and classes if they get stuck on said class or assignment."
10634,0,"I believe that driverless cars should not continue to be developed. Like all technology, its malfunctions can be unexpected. Also, driverless cars can not be 100% reliable. Finally, some parts of the driverless cars can be very distracting. All technology has its malfunctions, so what makes these cars different from that? At any given point, a driver could be just going down the street, and have a malfunction and start swerving all over the road. If that happened, it could be fatal for some people involved. ""their cars have driven more than half a million miles with out a crash"" but does that mean that atfter that half a million miles, it crashed? The cars are not 100% reliable as to their preciseness. The cars would use GPS to get the driverwhere they want to go. But what happens when the GPS is out of date and they have a road under construction and the car just goes straight into that construction without a clue. The driverless cars cannot be relied on just by themselves. There have to be alot of new features in these cars, like cameras and touchscreen dashboards etc. The cars are designed to notify the driver when the car might not be able to handle whats coming up, so what happens when the car notifies the person and they start driving, and some of the features distract them? Thats a bad combination. So with all the new features, the cars can be made 100000% more dangerous to the drivers and the people around them. In conclusion, they cars are not suited to ever be on the streets. The driverless cars can become unresponsive and spaz out, distract drivers, or even be unreliable with navagation. So in my opinion, we should not let the driverless cars keep being produced and tested."
3880,0,"Space has always been considered the final frontier for humanity, and us as humans can only dream of what is out in the cosmos, awaiting to be greeted by us and our goals of exploration. That is why the exploration of Venus is so important, despite any and all dangers there are with doing so. Venus could be our stepping stone into a new era of exploration, pushing humanity into another golden era, or a renaissance. The first reason that will be explained as to why we should explore Venus, despite its hostile environment and dangerous aspects, is that it tells us more about the planet itself and gives us insight to dealing with more challenging and dangerous scenarios in the future. Knowing how a planet works will always be beneficial to us and help in future space exploration, especially when the planet is our planetary neighbor in the solar system, and may have once held attributes similar to Earth's long ago. The similarities between the two planets pushes for exploration as Earth may one day end becoming like Venus and require a call for innovations to accomodate humans onto the planet. This speculation on the similarities also points to the question on whether or not there was once, or still is, water on Venus. This is because if there really has even been any form of water on Venus, then that next points to the question about life on Venus. Venus's similarities to Earth don't stop, however, as Venus is at least now similar to Earth with its surface of rocky sediments, valleys, mountains, and craters. The rocky planet's formations and such have been found to be similar to those found very commonly on Earth, emphasizing on the theory that Venus may have once been similar to Earth, and if it can be helped to be restored. If this were possible, then it would make Venus a second hospitable planet for humans within the solar system making transportation easier than other planets as it is one of the closest planets to Earth, but cheaper as it would require less resources. In the end, Venus should still at least be explored more thoroughly on its surface, and perhaps later underneath into the deeper undergrounds below if the technology ever becomes available, as this allows for potentially useful information to be gathered on the planet."
17536,0,"Driverless cars is a big step in the future. It could have many positive effects on society. The car would save time and money for people every where. I am for the development of these unique cars. It will change the world. The development of driverless cars could potentially benefit the average persons' daily life. For example,texting while driving. To illustrate my point texting while driving has caused many deaths in the past. Driverless cars could drastically change that by allowing the driver text as it continues driving itself. The ""The Traffic Jam Assistant"" is good with going faster,breaking,and steering. Special sensors are used to alert the driver when certain situations come about. That is when the driver will have control. Driverless cars also has a better response and control than humans alone. According to the text it states how the Dubbed LIDAR uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings. This input is important for the car to imitate a human's skill at the wheel. Driving would be very easy. Driveless cars is a big step in the future. There will be many benefits if peoplewould consider using these fascinating vehicles. Not only it is a safety feature,but it saves time and possibly money. It can affect the society in many ways and possibly change the world today. That is why I am for the development of driverless cars."
21819,0,"I would type the more thorough answer, but being timed prevents me from doing that, so I'll make it quick. The main advantage I noticed is the decrease in air pollution. Being able to produce smog across an entire city like Paris is impressive alone, but...after reading Paragraph 17 in Source 2 (""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals...""), I'm not all too surprised. Another thing I'm not surprised about are French delivery companies whining about not getting paid enough during the ban ( Paragraph 18, Source 2 ). Guess what: It's just money, green sheets of decorated paper. Deal with it! Also, I noticed that Bogota holds a ""Car-Free Day"" once a year. Honestly, I say ""Well played."" Treating it as an annual tradition is the right move to get a group of people, regardless of amount, to do something. It's been getting positive comments ( Paragraph 24, Source 3 ), as well, which is a sign that it will last a long time. To sum it up, the second advantage is that it gives people the opportunity to enjoy the outdoors. That's basically the most brief explanation I can give that makes sense."

The planet has a surface of rocky sediments and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. ""In the text the author starts off his senteces with ""Long ago,"" This simply proves ""no spacraft survived the landing for more than a hours,"" which is also stated in the text in paragraph 2. In paragraph 2 the author also states Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us."" The author is making it clear it want be easy doing research on Venus. In the text paragraph 3 states ""A thick atmosphere of alomost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clounds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmoshere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times than what we experience on our own planet."" The author is make his or her point how exploring Venus can be very challenging. In the text the author states ""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though mercury is closer to the sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface."" The author is making it clear as posible of the danger that comes along with studying Venus's atmosphere. The author states in paragraph 5 ""The National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA) has one particularly compelling ideal for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the Hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray."" The author is backing up his or her claim by using a outsiders voice. In this case The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). In the text the author state in paragraph 7 "" NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus.""Once again the author is using a outsiders voice to state his or her claim. The textes also states in paragraph 7 "" Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War ll."" The author is just interducing some of the project he or she had in mind. In the text the author states in paragraph 8 ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has Value not only beacuse of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also beacuse human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on Earth and Beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" The author is simply resting his or her claim, based on the suggestion they made to study Venus, and why they think Venus is worthy pursuit the dangers it presents."

Even if there were alien's out there, we should have found them by now. With all our space gadget's that we have that can look deep into space, i'm pretty sure we would have found alien's by now. Even though people have ""spotted"" alien UFO's, they have no proof. People could have said they even spotted it, but then again since their on video, they could have photoshopped it.

21931,0,"Florida State Senator, The Electoral College is a crucial part of the United States's election process. There are some negatives to the Electoral College but the positives outweigh them by a landslide. The certainty of the outcome and having a president that the majority likes are key beneficial factors to the Electoral College process that would be lost if we changed the election by popular vote for the president of the United States. With the Electoral College, there is a very rare chance that there would be a tie in the nationwide electoral vote. However, according to In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner, ""A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible--it happened in 2000--but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" A clear winner will always be produced with the slight innormality of a tie. In 2012's election, Barack Obama received 51.3% of the popular vote compared to the 61.7% of the electoral vote. If the election process was by popular vote, it would have been a much closer race between Obama and Romney. To win the Electoral College vote, each region must like you. You cannot have a presidential candidate that favors one region and only one region favors that candidate. In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner states, ""...a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president."" In contrast, The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer claims that even ""at the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states."" What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register says, ""The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President."" Because of the number of electoral votes each state has is based on population, meaning Texas has more votes than Rhode Island, every presidential candidate focuses on winning over the big states. The big states are a better representation of our nation's opinion. The Electoral College process should not be replaced by the popular vote due to the extremely rare chance of a tie. It should remain because an outcome is certain and majority of the population would like the president."
20158,0,"Cars that drive themselves seem very fututistic, but we are very close to successfully making a car like this. There are many obvious benefits to manufacturing cars like this. I think the most important benefit is in our enviroment. Some other benefits are that we won't have as many deathly car crashes and we would still be able to take control of the vehicle if needed. We shouldn't be scared to make this change that could potentialy change our future for the better. Our enviroment has severely suffered from the massive carbon footprint that our generations have left. A big issue we have is that our air is very polluted. A big factor in this is that billions of people use cars all over the world. This self driving car would use half of the fuel that our cars today use. This could greatly decrease our pollution in big cities all over the world. Car crashes are one of the biggest contributors to our death rate. There are many innocent people who die every day due to other people not paying attention to the road. Google has a car that is somewhat driverless and hasn't crashed once even though they have driven half a million miles. The technology that would be used in these cars would be smart enough to drive safely and alert the person in the vehicle when human assistance is needed. We have the ability to save many men, women, and children by allowing the self driven cars to transport us. Many skeptical people think that giving up control could lead to accidents. When the car senses that there is danger ahead, they alert the person that they need to take over. If someone notices something the car doesn't, they can just put their hands on the wheel. People could still drive their cars if they felt necessary. We wouldn't be fully giving up control if we can just take it right back. Now you see that there are many benefits to making self driven cars. The possibility of some minor negative things that can be fixed, doesn't compare to the positive results we can gaurentee this vehicle might bring. The enviroment will be much better and we will have healthier air to breathe, because we will use less fuel. Our death rates will go down and we can save our future generations with these safe cars. Finally, if anything does happen, we can take back the control of the car at any second. The people of this world will thank us for bringing this self driven car to the streets."
18680,0,"Changing The Future Times are changing. Driverless car technology is being created, with slow and steady progress. The technology for these type of cars has only been developed over the last few years because of a lack of technology. There are several companies trying to develop these cars, but they're pretty much at the same step. Knowing how driverless technology works, who is liable for damages, and how it will effect drivers is crucial to the possible future use of driverless cars. Driverless technology has to be understood by the consumer. If the consumer does not know how this technology works, it could cause some serious damage. The consumer has to realize that driverless cars aren't completely driverless, the consumer has to know that they have to remain attentive while being in the driver's seat. ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" (Driverless Cares Are Coming paragraph 7). Without the realization that they have to be attentive, some bad accidents could occur. Liability for the accidents caused by driverless cars has to be settled. The companies that make the driverless cars, or the driver, it is yet to be determined who would be at fault. The company for making flawed technology, or the driver for being in the car. ""Still, even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturere?"" (Driverless Cars Are Coming paragraph 9). This will be a huge issue if driverless cars do become legal. Driverless cars could effect the people in more way than one. The effect of drivers in the future if cars become driverless. Their is a great possibility of issues coming with driverless cars, some subtle, and some severe. Also, who would want a driverless car if you still had to driver it? That does defeat the purpose of the name of the car. ""Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?"" (Driverless Cars Are Coming paragraph 8). Being occupied while sitting there is imperative. People will become bored if they have to just sit in the seat all day long. Companies have to come of with entertainment systems, but an issue with that is losing attention. While being in the driver's seat of a driverless car, being attentive is imperative. There may be situations where the car cannot handle it, and it requires human skills. ""This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" (Driverless Cars Are Coming paragraph 7). There is a double whammy right there. Companies have to balance out occupying the driver and keeping them attentive; but there is no way to be distracted and attentive at the same time. The risks involved with driverless cars are way to high for the potential payoff. The technology that is being developed might have a future, but in the near future, there is no way it'll work. Right now, they aren't even driverless cars, the cars still require a driver. Surely there will be progress on that aspec of the cars. Just simple knowing how the cars work is the first obsticle. Also, being able to figure out who is liable for damages between the manufacturer, or the driver of the car is a huge issue that comes with this. Lastly, how it will effect future driver's skills, and attentiveness while driving. Will there be a future in this industry, or not? Only time will tell."
5907,0,"The use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. The reason for this is that you can tell weather the person is really smiling or not. The computer software FACS (Facial Action Coding System) can classify 6 basic emotions like happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. The passage states that the computer contructs a 3-D computer model of the face;all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an 'action unit. The passage also states that using video imagery, the new emotion-recongnintion software tracks these facial movments-in a real face or in the painted face of Monia Lisa. It can even identify mixed emotions. Each exspression is compared against a neutral face. The computer can tell weather you are happy or sad. Like in the passage it says that for an example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it can modify the lesson like an effective human instructor. The evidence from this passage shows that the use of this technology to read the emotional exspressions of students in a classroom is very helpful. like stated in the claim and passage ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."""

My reason that the ""face"" discovered in Mars is fake because the area where the ""face"" was discovored (Cydonia) has stroms their a lot and snow. So, there is a possibility that it was huge landform and the weather wore off the the landform to the point where it was a face. About a month ago we have released the picture in a JPL web site, revealing that the ""face"" is just another landform. As of right now we are trying to look at the ""face"" to look and conclude it is another Landform and not ""aliens"". we have also found that the landmass is the bottleneck of a volcano so maybe in a few years it will erupt and prove that it's not a face. Yes, we have made history by taking one little picture that we can't even look at it. If you wanna look at the ""face"" just look up these coordinates. 41 degrees north martian latitude. maybe you will see it as a landform and not a face.

8725,0,"I believe using the Facial Action Coding System in the classroom would be very beneficial. If students were confused by the lesson the teacher could change the lesson up. This technology could also identify if there is anyone in the room who is feeling sad or upset. Lastly, this technology could help students not be as stressed by the homework they receive. The uses for this kind of technology are endless. This technology could change the way a teacher teaches. It could help them curve a lesson to either make it easier or more difficult. Depending on the student's facial expressions, the teacher could know whether their students are getting the lesson or not. If the students were confused and puzzled by the lesson, then the teacher would bring the difficulty down a little bit. If the students were bored because the things being taught were too easy, the teacher could give some extra work to keep those bored students busy. This technology could help the students on a personal level too. It would help them whether they were feeling upset, depressed, or are just having a bad day. The technology could sense that a person was upset, and the teacher could go over to that student and have a conversation with them and see what is going on. This technology could get people the help they need because people don't always sense that one of their friends are depressed. Another use would be for identifying bullying victims. This technology could have a big impact on the work load that students receive. If the computer sensed that everyone in the class knew exactly the lesson and did not need help at all, that might be a sign that they need to move on to the next lesson and stop reviewing with homework. On the other hand, if the students were not getting the lesson, or were confused, the teacher could assign more homework and give extra help to those who need it. If the students were getting very stressed, night after night with the work they received, that would tell the teacher that they need to slow down and take more time on a lesson. This could also tell the teacher to lighten up on the work load because the students were having a hard time understanding the teacher's lesson. The technology mentioned in this passage would greatly improve student's lives. It could get them emotional help. This computer program could help the students if they were having a hard time understanding the teacher's lesson. It could tell the teacher to lighten up the work load if everyone in class was stressed out. Many benefits can come from technology like this implemented into the classroom."

Imagine if u could just sit back and relax while your car is casually stolling through traffic. In paragrapgh 2 it says the cars arent truly driverless. Which i think is a good thing. If our car was 100% driverless we wouldnt have controll of how we get to places. And what if your car accidently makes a wrong turn. You should have the power to put it back on the desired path. Driverless cars are closer to being apart of every day life than we think. Google has been developing self driving cars since 2009. Imagine the progress they will have made in 2020.

11675,0,"The Face has been the main topic of discussion. People believe that the Face was created by aliens. The Face is not a alien creation but rather just a normal landform on the surface of Mars. If the Face was an actual alien's face then NASA would've found the alien of that size by now. However, the Face is too big to be the face of an actual organism. Upon further examination, the Face has been found to be just a landform. The enhanced picutre taken in 2001 proves the fact that it is a landform. The camera technology was not advanced enough in 1976 which is why the photo looked like a face. Many conspiracy theorists claim that the Face was made by aliens but they don't have enough information to protect their claim. Many people who have seen the enhanced image of the Face believe that alien marking were covered by haze. That claim was brought down after NASA took another picture on a cloudless day with a maximum resolution camera; you could see everything in the picture and there was no alien markings. Other conspiracy theorists claim that NASA is hiding the truth about the Face and its alien creators. That may raise some thoughts but if there were truly aliens who created the Face, NASA's budget would rise quickly to find those creators but none were found. Overall, the Face has been proven to be a natural landform and not a alien creation. NASA has been looking for more life on Mars for many years but no life was found; aliens are just characters of fiction."
13593,0,"The Mystery of the Unmasking Face on Mars In the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" people think that the face was created by aliens. In this essay I will tell you if the face was created by aliens or if it was just a natural landform. Why would people think this face was created by aliens? Or was it just a natural landform? What would you think about the face being created by aliens? Now that we got that out of the way, Why would people think that the face was created by aliens? There was not much evidence that the aliens were the ones that created the face. People can not just go around saying that aliens caused the face to happen, Because there was very little proof that it caused by aliens. Garvin also said, ""It reminds him of Middle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" In paragraph 12. And in paragraph 7 it also says that there was no alien momentum after all. Also, Some people think that the face is just a natural landform. I think that the face was caused why a natural landform because I found more information that the face was caused by a natural landform. Like, in paragraph 7 Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team took a photo and when the image first appeared on a JPL web site it revealed that it was a natural landform. I think that if the face was really created by aliens there would have been more evidence or proof saying that aliens had created the face. Because there was more proof saying that the face was created by a natural landform. If there was more proof about the face being created by aliens than it just being a natural landform then I am not sure what I would have done. Last of all, I found out that there was more proof in the face being created by a natural landform than the face being created by aliens. There was more people talking about how it was not created by aliens and there was also people saying that there was proof saying that the face was created by aliens. But, I would have to say I will stick with there being more proof about the face being created by a natural lanform."

If i were a scientist at NASA and I had to convince them that the "" Face on Mars"" was not created by aliens i would simply say that there is no evidence that shows aliens where around. The arictle "" Unmasking the Face on Mars"" states that on April 5th, 1998 Micheal Milan and his Mars Orbiter Camera team tookphotographs of the object which clearly revealed that the "" face "" was a natural landform. Although people werent satified with the therory that the ""Face on Mars""is just a natural landform, it is the only conclusion that really makes sense.

I think its dumb to create drivless cars yea it can stop the texting and driving deaths and drunk driving deaths but they should'nt be doing it anyway. The only way drivless cars are useful is buses and taxis but even then your taking away jobs of hard working people. We do not even know how much these so called smart vehicles are gonna cost if its really expensive then its not gonna be used by the middle class people and thats mainly america. Most people dont have 100,000 dollars to spend on a vehicle. Another thing is that computers have flaws and if theres one mistake that can mean a persons safety at risk. I think they should keep working uncovering new technology and in maybe 10 years from now they make these vehicles avalible to the public. The smart road is effective but it is very expensive. New laws need to be made for these driveless cars like in a school zone you have to drive. but what about all the people that love driving are these driveless cars gonna be in the way of normal cars?. But what if the driver falls asleep while the car drives and he doesnt see the lights and gets in a car accident. I think if the car fails and someone gets hurt i think its the manufacturer that should be at fault because how are you gonna call a car a driveless car and not be truly drivless. I think if they want this to succeed they need to make this technology drive like a human. I think this is a great concept but i do not think it will succeed."
8196,0,"To think that scientists have been able to program a computer to tell what emotion someone is feeling at that moment is pretty amazing. It would take a lot of thinking and considering to then finally be able to tell a computer when a person has this or is showing that, that they would be showing that certain emotion. However, part of me thinks its not all it is said to be. Many people these days are very good at hiding their emotions and feelings. They may seem all happy and joyful to someone but on the inside they could really be hurting. Or it may be the other way around. They could act very sad, but actually just be trying to trick someone. If you were to put a computer up to someone like that, I just do not think it would be smart enough to detect that. Think about actors. They are one of the best people to hide true emotions. They are the ones that have to fake being happy or sad or mad or in disbelief. They can trick anyone into thinking that. On the inside though, we do not really know what it is they are feeling. In the passage it says that the computer detects the certain way the muscles in your cheeks are. It also is the way your eyebrows are. If your eyebrows are raised, this can show surprise. When your lips are tightened this can show anger. The computer has to be able to tie all of these things together. What if the person is showing all of these signs and it is their certain way of showing that one emotion. Everyone has their own way of showing each and evey emotion. For example, if a person is angry they do not always tighten there lips or lower their eyebrows. They could keep their eyebrows and lips the same but still be angry. For me, I just do no think that these computers are going to be as accurate as what you may think. Sure, it is most likely going to get a lot of peoples emotions but not everyone. It is talking about bringing it into classrooms to test people in a class emotions. It is going to be the same as doing it on the street. Not everyone is going to show their true emotion and the computer is not going to detect each and everyone of them either. So for this new technology that these scientists have discovered, I think it could work and I think it could fail. It all depends on how smart the computer is going to be or if it is just too smart. For many I hope it works, but I guess we are jsut going to have to wait and see."
9523,0,"I think that having driverless cars is the most ignorant things i have ever heard. Since when do we put out lifes on the line just so a machine can drive itself. What is going to happen when a dder runs out in the middle of the road and your little driverless car doesn't vibrate or beep in time for you to react and instead of just hitting the deer, the car makes its own choice to swerve out of the way putting your life in even more danger. I don;t believe that there is a technology that can just make choices and stuff on its own. Why not try this type of expierement with trains first and still have the conductor on board just in case anything goes wrong. I will admit, at first it struck my attention but the more I kept reading on and on about how there driver still has to be present during the drive because the car doesn;t know what to do when there is an accident or construction going on up ahead. Yes, there are idiot drivers out in the world today and yes they have caused a lot of accidents butI would rather there be a idiot driver out there compared to a machine that thinks on its own but only has to have a driver present. Think bout this, in the article it stated about putting cameras in the vehicle to keep an eye out on the driver. Well sadly, whether you like it or not nobody will pay full attention in a driverless car, people will get way too comfortable and start texting or jamming out to the radio. For example, people don't even pay full attention nowadays in their own car going down the road in full control. I think the whole camera idea is the most ignorant part about it. If you are so worried about what the driver is going to be doing and keeping you safe from getting sued, then I suggest that you don't even bother wasting your time and money trying to make this car work. Even if they did have cameras on the inside and outside of the car, what do you think would happen if a little kid or a deer ran out right in front of you and the cars little fancy cameras didn't have time to pick it up and brake. Whos fault would it be? In my opinion, it would be the manufacteres fault because if they tell me oh this car is great, it's a driverless car annd when there's a curve coming up and the car doesn't decide to turn and goes off the road putting my family and I's life in danger. I'd sue the manufacturer for everything they had becuase they lied to me. The choice is yours, buy what you want to buy. All I am saying is to make sure it is what you want and that it will keep you safe!"

According to the article, Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. According to the article i paragraph 2, In Venus since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. But this time can be changed. For example in paragraph 7, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus’s surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War II.

19993,0,"The development of driverless cars is a bad idea and here is why. Driverless cars have so many flows to there design. When it comes to driverless cars and many seneros that can happen that a driverless car can not handle.Apose to humans they see a problem they try to avoid the situation. With the driverless car it still needs a human for those those situations that the car can not handle.Driverless cars can only go up to 25mph. That would be fine if you weren't in a hurry to go get somewhere,also if your driving on the high way the driverless care is useless.It can't keep up with high way speeds and normal roads besides school zones are 30mph. If it requires a human then what is the point of a driverless car? The point is that there is no point to a driverless car if In a work situation you as the human have to navigate through the traffic.Because the driveless car is not capable of doing that it's self. Also with a driverless car, who would be at fault when you get into an accident where someone rams you on accident? How is the car going to report that or how can you argue who is in the right and who is in the wrong?On top of that ""traffic laws are written under assumtion that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times"". So they would have to rewrite laws for it to be able to drive the so called ""dirverless car,"" and it is so pointless to have one. Let's say if there is a very good hacker that can hack into the driverless care and cause so much damage to othere property. 25mph may not see to be alot but the care has to be controlled with some sort of computer system. Last time I checked computers can be hacked into and altered. So there is that risk as well. My closing argument is that driverless cars are just a bad idea they have to many risk and not enough award. The dirverless car has not only legal issues but safety issues as well.The over are car is pointless because you still need a human present to be able to drive it so there for this so called ""driverless car"" is render pointless in my eyes."

23031,0,"When people hear about banning or limiting car use they would think that's crazy. Why would the govenment ban car use? Why would anyone vote for cars use to be banned or limited? Most people ask these questions because they don't know how they would get to work or go to the store. But there are many ways to get from one place to another. One reason to limit or ban car use is because of greenhouse gases.""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.""(In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, paragraph 5) Most peple that live in heavily populated areas know what smog is and how bad it gets. Greenhouse gases are really bad fot the environment and for us. Paris is one of the cities with this problem. ""[Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussel and 79.7 in London...""(Paris bans driving due to smog, paragraph 17) Another reason to limit car use is because too many people are driving and it causes stress.""""It's a good opportunity to take away stressand lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos... as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.""(Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Botogta, paragraph 24) In colombia millions hiked, biked skated or took buses to work during car free day leaving streets with no traffic jams. """"When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,""... media trainer and mother of two.."" When people can't use cars they dont want to walk all the way to a store that maybe 5 or more miles away. But accordint to In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, "" In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.""(paragraph 6) In Paris, on the days people couldn't use cars, ""Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday..."" if the public transportation was free then on the days we don't use cars the same could apply here. The main reason for limiting car use is toreduce the amout of greenhouse gases. It's not that bad of an idea if you think about it. Cars wouldn't be banned forever just on certain days or untill the smog lightenes up. If Paris and Colombia and Cali and Valledupar are doing it we should too. Let's make the world a cleaner place because we only have one."

The Facial Action Coding System has lots of great reasons to why it's valuable for students in a classroom. I think the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. Why, because if the students had the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) the teachers would be able to see if the student's are focusing/paying attention to what it is that they are doing. The teacher's would be able to tell what's wrong with the student. The student's emotions would show on the system. I think it's a good idea, now the teacher's can read student's emotional expressions. If the student is not getting good grades, the teacher will be able to see what it is that the student is feeling. When the student's are feeling confused, the teacher will know. Some student's are shy to raise their hand or even ask for help on what they are confused on or about. "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". Reading the students emotional expressions, would be a specific result with the FACS (Facial Action Coding System). Maybe you could tell hows your friend is feeling by looking at them.

So yes, I think the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valueable."

Some small towns in Germany, Paris, and Colombia are car-free citys. In the passage In German Susburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, writen by Elisabeth Rosental, She tells her readers that a suburb in Germany, Vauban, has street parking, driveways, and home garages generally forbidden. Rosenthal states that not having a car can actually bring happiness. ""'When I had a car I was always tence. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walker."" In the second article, Paris bans dring do to smog, by Robert duffer, he tells the reader about the struggles Paris faced with polution in the air. He states that they made a system where one day they would have even licence plate number stay home one day and the odds would stay home the next. After trial and error, They came up with a solution, And it helped the smog go away. If cars were banned completly the air we breathe would be so much cleaner, and less foggy. ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescrind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday."" In the third passage Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, by Andrew Selsky, It talks about a car free day that takes place once a year in the town on Bogota. The passage also states that people hiked, biked, skated, and took buses to work during the car free day. Selsky states that the goal of the day is to promote alternative transportation and reduse smog, Which brings back the fact that not using cars reduses polution in the ait. The other reson banning cars is a good idea is because it redused stess, because you dont have to deal with traffic, find a parking spot, or worry about being late to work because you have to stop to fill up your tank in the morning. ""'It's a good oppotunity to take away stress...' said buisnessman Carlos Arturo Plaza"" The last article the End of Care Culture, written by Elisabeth Rosenthal, talks about how ""americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"". i beleive people are finally coming to the state of mind where public transportation is the faster, easier, and more afisiant way. Another reason it is better than having your own cars is that it is safer. ""'...public transpotation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resousrces, lower emissions and improve safety."" The main advantages of limiting car usages are happiness, lower in polution, lower in stress, and increase in safety."
4413,0,"Throughout the story of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author gives many claims as to why studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it gives. In my essay supporting the claim i'm going to give three reasons as to why this is a worthy claim. Studing Venus is a worthy pursuit for many reasons. The first reason is that ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth."" Earth gives people a home and a life, some people would like to get to know what once made Venus able to give a similar life as Earth has. As study says, Venus has once had similarites as Earth like, craters, mountains, and even valleys. Althought Venus once had these qualities it is impossible to now travel there. Another reasons as to why studying Venus is a worhty pursuit is that ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"". The curiosity of humans is very strongly thought of nowadays. Planets are always thought about and how life could be on those places. Since Venus was the only planet with human life characteristics the idea of innovation is widley spread. The last reason in my essay is that studying Venus would be an amazing expeirence for the human life. Venus is one of the broghtest and most beautiful points to see from the sky, but it's also very dangerous. In the passage it says that ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. On the planet's surface, temperatures over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet"". In conclusion, there are alot of reasons as to why studying Venus would be a worthy pursuit for the human life."

Using this software is valuable and can help to read students expressions. The Mona Lisa demosntration is evidnce that it can bring a smile to your face becuase of how this technology can show what it can do. In paragraph 6, its says if you smile when the computer is showing you something that you like, then a similarad might follow. If your emotions then change, the next ad will be different. The computer can help a student if he/she is bored or confused. This technology can help people in many ways. This new technology is valuable to read students emotional expressions. The Mona Lisa is a great demonstration to use as proof of why it's valuable. This can help students and help others to know if they are sad or mad.

Us humans never thought that we could get this far and we finally did to some people it isn't real. To me as a person reading this it doesnt seem real doesnt seem as if it would happen and that we couldnt do it if we really thing on this it could be a bad thing cause what if someone was careless. Of their car and was to cause an accident and possibly kill another person thats not a good thought but we have to add thewhat if it is a big possibility that it can happen yeah it would delete. A lot of drinking and driving and lots of people drinking under the influence and killing people but if they make the cars and peple can still open the car doors and drive themselves. You still have crazy driver and drunk driver and people under the influence that are on the roads with innocent people driving with their families. Their are a large amount of dangerous people in the world just having cars to go do things for you wouldnt stop hunger and any other problems that the world has. My opinion to these cars that they are planning to create I think it would be a waist of money cause we dont thing about the. Bad weather that we get and how the weather can cause crashes so still I believe no they should not be produced.
2221,0,"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author writes about the idea of exploring Venus. The author mentions many obstacles, that make the exploration of Venus hard, but he also talks about why it is important for us to explore the planet. One of the most important reasons, to explore Venus, is the fact that Venus could once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. The author writes ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life"". The author also brings out the fact, that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit. In Paragraph 8 the author writes about how exploring the planet would not just be for the information, but to feed the curiosity that humans naturally have. According to the authors opinion, if we can defeat the problem that is exploring Venus, we will be more confident and innovative facing equally intimidating endeavors in the future. The author expresses his opinion about exploring by saying ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expnded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" So in Paragraph 4, when the author says ""The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable"" he means that the insight we would gain and the satisfaction of feeding our curiosity makes Venus a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. I truly hope,that the challenge of exploring Venus will be defeated, because it could possibly change the way we see our World."

If we didn't take risks, nothing would progress and we wouldn't advance anymore as humans after the we had what we needed for survival. In fact, we might not even have what it takes to survive. Exploration will always be a large part in taking risks and it there will always be something mroe for us to explore, it's inevitable. Venus is not any different than what we have ever gone through. Are there challenges? Sure. Are there ways to go around those challenges? Always. There are so many interesting parts about Venus that we have yet to explore. Signs of natural resources can show that there could have been life and could possibly become a crutial part of Earth and its inhabitants, being the neighbor planet. Venus is one of the closer planets to Earth along with Mercury. Though it is hard to explore due to its conditions, Venus has a lot of similar features as Earth. With valleys, mountains, and craters, Venus has increased many peoples interests with its mysterious layers and what was shown to come before space exploration. This would create a large impact on humans around the world, not just knowing by knowing that we conquered a great quest to recieve more information and useful data, but by creating an idea that no matter what comes your way, you can overcome it and go above and beyond other peoples expectations. The dangers of Venus is just an obstical over the pot of gold. Exploring Venus would change the world and just might save us if we're ever in that time of need, never say never. On the contrary, Venus does have large setbacks that could hold us back from doing so. Like the planets surface temperature, 800 degrees fahrenheit is a lot higher than any human can handle, along with 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets that create the atmosphere for the planet. Although these conditions would be harsh, humans could survive with the correct equipment and strong motivation. Just like during any new accomplishments, you have to be patient. Nothing will come to you if you try to rush the process, but if you are patiently waiting and working hard, it could lead to a greater impact. Technological advancments will also play an unbeliveably large part it what makes this possible. Without advancements, nothing new will get created and we won't be able to reach the surface or get any closer than we have today. In conclusion, the best way to get to know something better is to get to the surface or maybe even below the surface. You won't truly know anything more unless you create a path to. In order to create beneficial to this Earth, you have to take risks, put yourself out there and do it. It won't get done itself and if you aren't going to, then who will? Venus and its conditions is just an obsitcal leading to something great and innovative."

Dr. Paul Eckman explains it in paragraph 3 he says this ""For example you frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're surprised"". Then that's when Dr. Huang comes in at he says ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"". Dr. Huang uses things like video imagery, the emotion-recognition, it tracks the facial movements. It can track the facial movements in a real face or in a painted face of Mona Lisa. Dr. Huang explain that "" by weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions."" In paragraph 5 it says that ""Its a fact that humans perform this same impressive calculation every day"". It also says in paragraph 5 that ""you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face"" and 9/10 times that's ture. When your with a friend and he/she is mad your going to know and ask he/she wht's wrong. Paragraph 6 says ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" That's something I never knew or heard about! Dr. Huang and other DRs. is stating things I never knew about in this artitcle. The artitcle is well explained. This is why I said it is a good idea becaue they explained it really good. They had facts and had a good reason for it. I think this artitcle will make you think it's a good idea.

The author gives a great evaluation about the way he supports the idea of studying venus whhic is honestly a great idea but he also talks about the wonders of venus and also challenges that they would come across such as like th atmosphere, it's inhospitable, but Venus was long ago just but it went trough some extreme climat changes and that's why is inhospitable now. Concluding all it would be great to go and study venu's surface because it would help understand how it changed so much trough the years and what made it change so much, and also help reach further out into the universe. Humans have already gone to the moon, why not go further?"
6803,0,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. Now, is this technology needed in a classroom? It really does not need to be in a classroom, but it can be used for more important task like using it to see other old painting expressions. For most children in school they all have mixed emotions, and what does seeing how happy they are change anything. Children go to school to learn and get education. Some children are happy to be at school, while some are not happy to be at school. And thoes children already show their expressions. When a child is happy and wants to do work at school, they are the ones to always raise their hands and are bubbley. While the children that are not happy to be at school are usually the ones to not sit right, slouch, and do not raise their hands. Most schools say that they want their students to be happy at school, but with all the work that all children have to do and how they are taught to learn, they do not show the same effect on all children. Some children like things to go one way, while the other children like it the other way, so in that case not all children could be happy at school, unless they were to slit things up to make evey child happy and they still learn the things that they need to learn. In the article, it states,"" Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's slime. But we can write down some simple instructions that ""encode"" different emotions,""(paragraph 7). If our computers at home can not handle the power that is used to detect one of our emotions, how can so many more computers on one software be able to do that. Schools need to spend money on other things like maybe new floors for the gym, or new lockers, what ever it is there are more important things that need to be done before spending money on a computer that can detect wheather we are happy or not. A way that the Facial Action Coding System can be used in our schools is to see how every child likes the way they learn. Some children can be so comfused in a clas but they never ask for help because they are too embarresed to raise their hand so they hide behind a computer screen and never get the help they need. And if others can see his expressions and notice he needs help they could help out. There are children who need help but are too scared to raise their hands because then they will stand out, and maybe even made fun of. They hide behide a computer screen so people will not know who is confused or needs help. In the article, it states,"" By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpiece),""(paragraph 8). This states that it can identify if a child is confused, mad and/or sad about their issuse and their communitcation skills. It can help out the adules on the school help out the children of the school. If they had the Facial Action Coding System in classrooms, it could help a lot of children come out of their shells and maybe even change in a fantastic way. Overall, the Facial Action Coding System is an amazing thing that can identify people's expressions, it does not really need to be in a classroom, but it can definetly come in handy. Maybe just in the libraray but not in every classroom. They can be very helpful for old paints and seeing those expressions. But there are people out there that put on a fake smile everyday to show others that they are not in pain when they actually are. A lot of people put on an ""act"" for others, meaning that they smile and looks so happy to others, while actually they are hurting and are in pain on the inside. Most people would not notice because they only see what other only show."

15800,0,"If I were a scientist, I would argue that the face is a natural landform. Discussing the topic of a ""face"" on the planet would be incredible. Other scientists may not believe my claim. One reason on why I believe this is because on the photographs, the ones side by side in the article show craters or other things that may resemble to a face. In the article it says,""Scientists figured it was just another Martian Mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyption Pharaoh."" The article also said,""The caption noted a "" huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed my shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.""The face became popular for its looks.""The ""Face on Mars"" has since become a pop icon."" A second reason is that Scientists explored the photogragh taken, and the photo showed nothing but a ""natural land form"". The article says,""Thousands of anxious webs surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument there after all."" According to the scientists who snapped these intriging photographs, not everyone was satisfied. The article says,"" a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet.""This may have been said by the unhappy people of the internet. Although there are photos that may say that there are no alien traces or markings, people still believe there may be alien existance or cause in the face. The article says,""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face.Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze."" In paragraph 9,""We just dont pass over the face very often."" Besides peoples' beliefs on the topic, there is evidence that may refute their thoughts. In paragraph 11, it says,""If there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you would see what they were!"" Also, In paragraph 10 it says,"" Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001- a cloudless summer day in Cyodonia- Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. We had to roll the space craft... using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" As you may tell they say nothing relatable to aliens. In conclusion, If I were a scientist I would believe that the face is a natural landform. Evidence supports the claim, and scientists not on my side may still be skeptical. In my eyes, they're wrong with there thoughts on the topic of the natural landform called the ""Face on Mars""."
546,0,I believe that the author was very clear and supportive to this cause. I think maybe someday they'll be able to create something that can stand Venusis high tempeture readius and might even be able to create something strong enough to eventually have living forms there once again. once that is done humans can come and go and can maybe even live there someday with all the technology that's hopefully and possibly coming out later on in life to let and alow human lifeforms to live and reform again there. This is a great topic to stand towards I love talking and learning more about space and would love to see in the future a great machein to allow anyone to live there again what a thrill and adventure that I can feel going to happen later on in earth's life. What an experiance we may be able to be apart of later on.
23206,0,"Dear,state senator The Electoral College voting method is a very debated subject among the people. That is why I am here to explain to you my opinion on it, and why i think that the whole process needs to be stopped. As you can probably already tell, I completely dis like the whole process all together but anyway here is my letter to you. The first issue with this process is that there is not that much stability to it. When people vote for who they want as president they're giving their votes to some one else just so the person they gave them to can vote for who they want to,not for the elector that that person actually put down on the ballet. We the people are not even the ones who technically get to pick who we want as president, it's the electors. This being said brings me to my next point,what is the point of the people voting if we arent even the ones who get to pick the representatives? Yes, they say that when people are voting,they are actually voting for electors but what if the electors dont listen to the peoples votes and only vote for who they want? It is true that the slate of electors is trusted to vote for the parties person they want to elect but, there is always that tiny percentage that the electors can break that trust. When they take these chances they are setting themselves up for disaster. I hope that you take what I said into consideration. These are just a few of the things that are wrong with the Electoral College system. Its only a matter of time before people like me start to realize everything wrong with the system we have now, and when they do realize the things wrong with it, they will want something done about it. Please help get a better system going and end this Electoral College crap we have now."
5714,0,"I think the Facial Action Coding System is valuable. It also doesnt do any harm, so i think ther shouldnt be an agument on why they shouldnt event ths type of technology. Making these types of inventions can even be helpful not just for the Facil Action Coding system but to many other inventions. They are becoming more advanced in technology and are capable of developing more interesting inventions. Many students also some times have problems trying to fihure out what there feeling or to tell some one how they feel. I agree that the Facial Action coding System is valuable and ould be used for goods. This technology can be used for many thing and in a very good way. For ecample like the author wrote in the article. They can make changes in many things by seeing the emotions in a sudents face. For example in some ones homwork, in a book there reading. By reading there face expresions they can use that technology for the good of a person. They can find new things and make changes. So the things that are boring or sad or anything that is making someone not be intirested in something make them more intiresting. In my opinion people that make stories or news papr aricles want there work to be seen and get many reviews. So by figuring out what some one is really intirested in is a good way know. Many people like new developments. If this type of work becomes more advanced it could be something good. In my opinion i think its valuable. It does no harm to some one and it heps so some one could be under stood and helped. This technology could be used for many thing. Its also once more a new invention and helpful for many more. It also is a very intiresing in the way it works. Just because it was well diveloped to know how the human face works and the changes it makesevery time it has a diffirent expression. Thats why i think this development is very valuable."
14767,0,"In the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" it tells us about a ""face"" that was found by a NASA Viking 1 spacecraft. Many may belive this ""face"" was created by aliens on Mars. However I will prove to you using text evidence that this so called ""face"" was actually just a landform. In this artice on May 24, 1976 a NASA spacecraft was circling Mars searching for a place for the Viking 2 to land on the planet when it came across a landform that looked like a face. However, it could not have been a face due to the low quality of a picture the blurryness made the image look like it had shadows that gave the face a nose, a mouth, and some eyes. In order for NASA to prove to the Americans that this was not a landform created by aliens on Mars they took another picture in 1998. By looking at this picture and another picture from 2001 in these higher quality pictures it does not look like a face at all. Another reason other than physical evidence, is the fact that NASA would not lie about life on Mars. If the U.S. found physical evidence of life form on any other planet than Earth they would most definetly spread the news. Finding life on other planets would be a huge accomplishment and a very exciting thing. One landform from a blurry photo that looks like a face will not prove there is life on Mars. ""It's not an easy target Cyndonia,' says Garvin.'In fact it's hard work."" A quote from the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"". Why would NASA put in hard work to prove that the landform was not an artifact made by aliens? Because its not an alien made artifact. They took time and a lot of money to see if it was just a landform so they made absoute 100% sure it was just a landform so that they didnt waste money on chance. In order for aliens to be able to survive on Mars, they would have to have food, water, plants, and shelter. All of these things Mars does not have. How is an alien supposed to survive without the natural resources it needs to live? How would an alien even be able to make a huge artifact on mars without any tools? In conclusion, the landform found on mars was indeed not made by aliens. They have picture proof, if they actually found evidence for life on Mars they would tell the world,they spent lots of money making sure it was just a landform, and Mars doesn't have the resources that an alien would need to survive. If NASA ever finds life on Mars they will tell us but for now Mars is a big empty planet."
22030,0,"Dear Florida State Senator, The Electoral College needs to be disbanded. There are many reasons why the Electoral college needs to be stopped, but I will go over that later. How is it fair to Americans, if you say we have a vote that counts when we are just voting for a slate of people that might vote for someone we do not want. The voting process needs to be handled by the people, and who we want to run this country that we live in. The voting process is just not fair to Americans. It's in the constitution that we have a right to vote and that we have the right to choose our president, but you people in the electoral college take away that right when we only get to vote for a slate of people. If elections were done by popular vote things might have been different in many ways. First off, in the 2000 election if it was done by popular vote, Bush would not have won and we would have had, Al Gore as president. The electoral college is just uncompletely fair to voters. Because, in some states they have a winner-take-all system, so the presidental candidates to spend time in those states to get their vote. Seventeen States did not see the presidental candidates at all in 2000 campaign, so what is the point in having voting in those states if we dont know who we are voting for and why we are voting for them? There is not a reason to vote when the electoral college votes fore us. Yes, sometimes people do not know what they are voting for and why, but that is because we have no say, it is not up to the people who is going to the president of the country of we live, because the electoral college will not let us choose who we want. Many people, very important people, such as Jimmy Carter, Richard Nixon, and the U.S Chamber of commerece have agreed that we should abolish the Electoral College and give the people the vote and see who wins president then. If the people had a vote on who is president it would be very simplier, than the Electoral College when they have a tie, we would not have to bounce the decision, we could radomly choose one state and let them vote to see who the president is for 4 years. Yes, some may agrue that randomly choosing one state would somehow turn out to but a massive mistake, but there is a way to make sure that no state gets selected 2 times before the first time of any other state. Many my agrue that, the Electoral college is there for our benefit. Tell me one benefit there is to having no vote as regular citizen. I get it that there are more people in some states than others, but that does not mean we all get the same number of electoral votes as the huge states such as, California, Florida, and Texas. So if we are not going to have the same votes number of votes no matter what why does it matter if we give the people the option and have them vote for who they want, it is because the Electoral College does not care who we want they choose the president on who they want. Also, if it is up to the Electoral College then why does it matter if the citizens vote, I mean of course we want to give our input of who we want, but it does not matter, because our state senators will go behind our back and vote for someone we do not want. America, of course, has many more freedoms than other countries and we are not taking advantage of that, because we can not allow the people to vote for the President of the United States. The citizens do not want to vote for a slate of people, they want to vote for our president. So let me ask you as my Senator, what are you going to do about it?"
8632,0,"How can facial scanning computers tell people's true feelings? Sure, computers can read our face and tell us the expression given, but they cannot tell how you are truly feeling unless we tell them ourselves. Facial expressions on people's faces defintely tell us how they look and might feel but not all smiles can be true just by scanning someone, expecially with computers. Technology can tell a person their expression but not their mood of the day or that current second you have a device scanning you. Technology results always malfunction or crash or never come out correct. However, today people are deciding that technology has improved with that even though it has not. In the article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" it sates in the first paragraph,"" She' 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. No that's not your science teacher, grading your latest lab assingment. It;s the subject of Leonardo da Vinci's Renaissance painting, Mona LIsa- at least according to some new software that can recongnize emotions."" In this quote, it clearly states that it's just some new type of software that thinks it can scan emotions. Yes it says emotions but cannot scan the deeper meaning inside humans. NObody can tell how you're feeling except yoursef. In the article, it also states,"" IN fact, we humans perform this same impressive 'calculation' everyday. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face.""This quote states that people make suggestions on people's feeling but their observations, not the person telling them. People shoud not be putting all the say in technology or observation because you never now whether you could be wrong or right. Having this device in the world is a 50/50 win-lose situation. Many people do believe that these devices can help people out with telling their emotions but not the true mood. Also stated in the article, ""Using video imagery, the new emotion- recognition software tracks these facials movements-in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa."" Along with saying that computers can detect fake smiles and real smiles, this is correct which also explains they can never know the true meaning. Lastley stated in the article, it says"" TH the real simle, the zygomatic major lift the corners if your mouth while in a false smile, the mouth is streched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle."" This shows that technology can only detect the real or fake smile of someone along with a ""true"" expression for someone from observation. IN conclusion, everyone cannot lie on technology for everything because you never know when the computer is making a fase observation,because people make mistakes everyday along with computers. And if we simply cannot trust them with that, then how can we know we can believe their results about facials and not the true mood."

Because every single time we learn new stuff about Venus, how we can despite the danger of Venus to d not happen again. We have learn that Venus ground is really hot. but however, peering at Venus from ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on the ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate dense, studying Venus is a great idea because we are discovering new ideas. scientists seeking to conduct a thorough misson to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks or maybe we should think of them as challagnes. And it makes scientits to think more, get new ideas many researchers are working on innovations that allow our machines to las long enough. NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. for example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of the Venus surface. Another project is look back to an old technology called mechanical computers, These devices were first envisioned in the 1800. These devices make calculation by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all. To study Venus we could make new aireplanes for not touching the ground of Venus.

Counsollors could also use it because sometime students says everything is alright but deep down inside they are really hury so this facial reader can tell that the student isn't okay and the counsollor can figure out why the student is having a hard time and what is going on. The teacher and counsollor could also use it for fun like when students are laughing and having a good time to see how many of them are fake laughing at the terriable joke the teacher just told or if they really thought the joke was funny. They could also use it for experiment in scinents class to test where people get frustrated and how people get happy there are probably a miilion thing a teacher could use the new technology for. Every teacher and counsollor needs one of these facial readers because there would be many benifits for it and help people understand people more and how to help them when they dont come to you for help."

I went to this program and it was the time of my life! i got to go on nine trips-the most of any seagoing cowboy.The trip was an unbelievable and a huge oppurtunity for a small town boy like me.. I got to see some amazing things like, the Acropolis, the evacated castle in Crete, the marveled Panama Canal and taking a Gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. It took about two weeks to cross the Alantic ocean to from the eastern coast of the Unieted States and a month to get to china, but caring for the animals kept me busy during the crossing. they had to fed and watered two or three times a dayand thier stalls had to be cleaned. But this program is dangerous,i helped out my aunt on her farm which prepared me for hard work, but not for the dangers of the sea, i had a job to check on all the animals every hour, but one rainy night right after giving the report to the captain, i slid down off the slippery ladder on my backside, i shot feet first toward an opening side of the ship,but a small strip of metal saved me from plunging into the dark Alantic. I couldn't work for a while because of some cracked ribs.But i'm very grateful i'm still alive. Even though i was hurt, i still managed to have some fun, when the animals were unboarded some of us played games in their empty holds.Some of the thing we did were hold baseball and volleyball games, fencing,reading.table tennis, boxing and widdling. Being a seagoing cowboy was much more than an adveture, it opened up the world to me. i'm grateful for the oppurtunity,and it made me aware of of people and other coutries and thier needs. That awareness will stay with me foever.So in the future or even now you should definetly join the seagoing cowboy program and,maybe you'll experience something that will change your life foever."
18971,0,My position on the driverless car is against it. I am against it cause its a bad idea. There are so many things that could go bad. The cost for everything would go up; laws will have to be made and changed. I am against driverless cars for these reasons. First they wont have the same feeling of being behind a wheel and feeling in control. You will just sit there and have everything done for you. You will become lazy and not feel like you got to do anything; when the time comes that you need to drive you could be half asleep and get in an accident and serious loss or injury can occure. Second if the car malfunctions whos to say it wont veere off and slam into the side of a wall or hit another car. When it does malfunction and you have to get it fixed it would take longer and would cost more. It would take longer because the mechanic would have to know more about the car and how to fix more technology based stuff. It would cost more because its gonna take more time and the parts are gonna be more expensive because of the time and resources used to make them. Third it would take forever for all the laws to change and get new ones. There are already states that wont even let them test these types of cars. Also if they do get passed and everything is going good and one accident happens that involves the loss of people due to malfunction then people will get angry and want to ban them. People will blame the technology not the people using it So in conclusion im against driverless cars. Im against it because so many things could go wrong. Not just that but it would cost the people and the companys more to manufacture and buy the car. Also laws would have to be changed and new ones made which will take a long time. This is why im against the idea of driverless cars.

And Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota. In German they dont really care for cars "" Street parking, dirveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new districton the outskirt of Freiburg, near the french and Swiss borders."" there roads and sidewalks are mainly free they dont to many cars in German. The only people that was really allowed to have cars were car owners, but but there were ony 2 places to park ""Large garages at the edge of the development that casted $40,000 along with a home."" Some people felt like they were always tense when they had a car, they like not having a car so they wouldn't have to pay for the high gas they need for their gas tank. They felt like walking was way better, it was an exercise and it was more calming then being stuck in traffic. Paris bans driving because to many people are getting smoggeled.""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.""

You'd be helping our country because when Luke was in seagoing cowboy program it was 1945 and world war 2 was happening in Europe and he had to those countries recover. Luke had to help the horses when the war was over to get people places and to work. If you were 18 or up you might be lucky and be drafted into the military service. The UNRRA would hire seagoing Cowboys to feed the horses cows and mules that were shipped overseas. You'd be traveling around they world like Luke did. It took Luke 2 weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast. You'd be traveling to China, Europe, Greece, and many more places. The only way you'd be good at this job is if you wouldn't get sea sick because if you are a seagoing cowboy told travel overseas a lot. You'd have fun overseas if you don't get seasick. You'd have many adventures. You'd have many stories to tell your friends and family. You'd been in countries you'd didn't think you'd be in.

23591,0,"Everyday, citizens drive their vehicles to get to their destination. No one really stops to think how limiting car usage could be good for the enviroment. If citizens limit the amount of times they drive their car, there would be less traffic. There would also be less pollution and less stress for citizens. Traffic is a growing problem that tends to back up main streets, highways, and even back streets at times. In Bogota, Colombia they have a day devoted entirely to not driving a vehicle unless it is public transportation. ""It leaves the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams,"" as stated in source 3. Limiting car usage could prevent heavy traffic, accidents, and serious collisions. As fellow citizens, people should want to keep their enviroment pollution free. Pollution and vehicles go hand in hand when it comes to why limiting car usage is a good thing. Source 2 states, "" Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intense smog."" Smog is just like fog but it is thicker, more dense, and is harder to see through. That comes from the bad fumes that comes from many cars crowding up the streets. Due to the pollution the vehicles caused, no one is able to drive during smog which is why there was no traffic. In Paris, just like Colombia, they have stopped people from driving all the time. In Germany, many people have given up their cars. The citizens enjoy the stress free lifestyle of not having to drive a vehicle. ""When I had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way,"" as stated by a mother of two. Limiting your car usage can prevent many stressful things from happening during the day. Public transportion is another way someone can get to where they need to be. Citizens drive their vehicles everyday without ever thinking of how good limiting car usage could be. The limitation of cars reduces traffic, pollution, and stress throughout the day. Not driving as much gives you a chance to actually stop and ""smell the roses."" Driving is not always a good idea for people or for the environment around them."

In that quote it is saying that the Evening star is so bright that someone is not really paying attention could see it because it is so bright it can not be missed. It is also saying that it is one of the brightest points of light which means if you are lost you could look up and hopefully see that star and it will give you some light to find your way. Another quote from paragraph one is ¨However, this nickname is misleding since Venus is actually a planet. In our solar system, Venus is the second planet from our sun¨. This quote means that even though Venus looks like a star because it extremely bright, and shows off an extreme amout of light it is a planet. Many people mistake Venus as a star but once they find out it is a planet they are amazed because of the brightness of it. In paragraph two it says ¨Often referred to as Earths ¨twin¨, Venus is the closest planet to earth in tearms of density and size, and occasionally the closest distance to earth¨. In that quote it is saying that Venus is known as Earths twin because of the size. The Earth and Venus are about the same size. It also says that Earth and Venus have about the same density as each other. In my opinion I think that the planets should all be different sizes and densities because of the fact that everything is different. When it comes to planets they should all be different sizes, so that people can easily point out the planets and be able to name them easily and not get them mixed up because of them looking the same size in the atomosphere. In the passage in paragraph three it says ¨A think atomosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankes Venus¨. In this quote it states that most of Venus is covered in carbon dioxide. If scientists wanted to go study Venus they would have to have many layers of protection on because carbon doxide can be very harmful to the human body. Especially since the carbon dioxide percentage is so high it can extrmely hurt the human body of anyone that goes to Venus to study it. My thoughts on this topic are that if they want to study it they should send up a professional to put something on Venus that can dectect any movement or anything on the planet. They should do that so the scientists wanting to study Venus can study it from a safe distance and out of harms way."
3821,0,"Venus is sometimes called""Evening star"". It is the most brightest points of the light in the night sky. However, the nickname is not right since Venus is a planet. Venus is the closes planet that is like ours andthe same with density, and size,even the distances too. It has proved a very challenging place to exmaine more closely. No spacecraft survived the landing more than a few hours. It is super challenging for humans to study the planet. 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus. I think that venus is worthy of pursuit despite how dangers it is. I think that because it is almost just like earth. Maybe we can move people over there in time. If we get to studying on the planet is and the tempatures and if the planet has water for humans to drink. If we got the chance to study a different planet, then we need to. Earth is close to Venus all the time. Venus has high pressure and heat that are crazy. Venus has powerful volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning. Venus is sometimes can be our nearst option for a planetary visit. NASA, they are trying different ideas to help get humans on Venus to study that planet.The conditions on the surface of Venus. It would make it hard for scientists to be on the ground and touch it. The scientist would have to float all around the planet. THe temperatures would be toasty at around 170 degrees fahrenheit. Over all today, NASA is still trying to find ways to help scientist and humans to study venus. THey are trying to use stuff back in world war 2, to help them getting close to Venus. It is dangers to go there, but with the help of stuff to keep us safe, then it is okay."
6541,0,"In the artical ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" explans how there is a new type of technoligy that uses a coumputer system that lets people detect peoples emotions. To get the caculated expressions of someones human emotion the computer system uses a 3D model scan of the persons face then uses mats to detect the presons facal muscles then depending on the position they are will depend on there emotion. I think in a classroom or school situation this form of a computer system shouldent be used for schools for a number of reasons. In the artical the University says the softare couldent run on home computers and mostly all schools dont have amped up computers thet are bulit to run things like this. So if schools want to start using things like this they would need to get the money for the computers and the software if the founders of it are gonna put a price on it. Another reason is why would schools need such a system like this when they could just do this type of thing on paper with simple question to answer to see the students emotion in class. Or the school could send papers home to the parentes asking how the student is doing home and if the school should be worried about anything for the kids safety. Befor papagraph 8 the artical does give a pretty reason to use this type of system. They show the steps of how to smile or what it does to get the right type of smile to read the emotion of happiness. In the 8th paragraph it shows that in a real smile the muscles called the ""prbicuarlis oculi pars palpabraeus"" make the crow's-feet around your eyes. But when someone does a fake smile the mouth is stretches sideways using the ""zygomatic major"" and a different muscle, the ""risorius"". So when people smile they can be decteced if they are faking it or not. But in paragraph 9 ""according to the Facal Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresse emotions, but also may even help produce them."" So both paragraph 8 and 9 shows that there is a flaw in this computer system because if someone has never had a ""real smile"" and always used a ""fake smile"" the system will detect no happiness but the oppisite or something else. And thet person will always live with a ""fake smile"" and never a ""real smile"" beacuse the fake one will develop as a real smile if the person keeps doing it because of the facial muscles getting use to it. So in conclusion I dont think this technology that can read emotional expressions should be used because there are better ways of finding out a kids emotion. And becasue of the big flaw within the system, that being the human body actualy going aganst the facal scan by getting use to express a certan expression that reads differntly on the computer."

23186,0,"Presidents, they are the most powerful people in the United States of America. They are the people who make the tough calls for the masses to make sure the benifits of the majority are met because the needs of the many out weigh the needs of the few. Some people think that the way our presidents are elected today are not very practicle methods but some people do. Presidents are elected using two processes, those processes are popular vote and Electoral College. The Electoral College is not very practical in my book because they don't spend time in the places that they know they are going to win or not going to and Electoral College is not by majority. Presidents are like superstars of the political world but they don't spend any time in the places they are know they will win or lose. Source 2 states ""Candidates dont spend the time in states they know they have no chance of winning."" The candidates for the presidential election don""t even try to sway some of the states that either they know aren't going to vote for them or the opponent has already been there and gave them his idea on cetain matters. Voters are usally more thoughtful when they dont know who to vote for so the listen to both sides, but there is also the problem of majority in some places and not others. Majority also plays an impact on the vote of the presidency. Look at how many Electoral College votes California has, they have a total of 55 votes thats more than Wyoming by a land slide because Wyoming only has 3 votes total. If one side got Florida, Califronia, Texas and Massachusetts then the opposing side would have to get all of the other states just to catch up. The distrabution of the votes is a problem because some states are humongus but they dont have a large population. Some states are really shrimpy but have a abundance of people. These are just two reasons why the Electoral College process should be tossed out of the election decisions in general. Some people say the Electoral College process is just fine because this process aviods run off elections. Source 3 states ""Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recevies the majority of the votes cast."" They say this because of what happened in the Nixon and Clinton race in 1992. Neither one of them got the majority the both got 43 precent of the votes cast. This doesn't help the real problems at hand like the time management and majority issues in the states that have large amounts of people and little land and vis versa. The amount of votes each state gets is based on its population and its not fair to the staets that have less people just because of there location to suffer while the smaller more populos states don't. In future election the Electoral College should be taken out of the process in which the president is elected because of the miss use of time and the distribution of population. The popular vote process would eliminate both problems if it was the only process. It would eliminate the time spent in states by making them go to every single one or close to that. They would do this to make sure they got as many votes as possible. It would also eliminate the population aspect because every state would get to make a diffrence in the election of the president instead of having 3 votes and most of the other states having twice that or more. This election process is to complicated you should dumb it down or simplify it to increase the impact of each state and the simplfication for the soon to be president. We don't want him to change his mind about doing this important job for us as a country."
10955,0,"I think that using driverless cars are a positive thing. There are some negatives that come along, but everything has negatives with them. There are more positives to outweigh the negatives. I think it will be much safer and enviromentally friendly. Just think about all the drunk drivers out there. With the driverless car you do not have to worry about anymore. There are also a very high amount of people that text and drive or just on there phone. That is a bg safety issue. Again, the driverless car controls everything so you will not have to worry about any crashes or accidents because of people on there phone. It makes it easy to get places. There is a built in GPS, so the car already knows where to go. People get lost all the time because they dont know what to do or where to go. Yes the car does make the driver actually drive when there is a lot of traffic or construction, but by the time these cars come out I am sure that problem will be fixed. Even if the problem does not get fixed, the car will still have done most of the driving for you. It makes it so much easier on the people using the driverless cars. The driverless cars are extremely safe. There are sensors all over the car to show it how close thing are, when to stop, and where to go. There is another sensor that uses satellites to give it a map out of the car on the road, and the roads at all time. That is an axtraorinary device. The car only uses half the amount of gas that a normal car will use. That saves the owner of the driverless car a gigantic amount of money. It is also safer for the environent. If only half the normal gas amount is being used, then it is a geat thing for the Earth. There will not be as much drilling and sucking out of the gas. That will give the Earth more time to get more gas and it will last much longer for us to use. There are some negatives with the driverles car. If there is to much traffic, construction sight, or just something the automobile cannot handle then the driver will have to take over. That is a problem because why would you need to have a driver driver a driverless car? The cars still are noot fully ready and prepared to be used yet, so that gives the manufacturers more time to fix all of the flaws. There could be technical problems with the car, but that comes with anything there is that is new. There are most likely a couple years before these cars will be ready to sell, so that leaves a lot of time to fix all the problems and flaws. These driverless cars seem to be very safe, easy to use, easy to maintain, very helpful, and good for the environment. These driverless cars will be a ginormous help for everybody that is on the road. They are definitely a positive product for the world."

So you put it aside for next year becuase you wanted to hang out with your friends or faimly. Some people wanted to do things like programs or groups but couldn't becuase they have ""other things"" to do that aren't that really important. So this paper should make you think twice about going or signing up for the UNRRA program. My first reason to join the UNRRA program is becuase you get to help other people in other countries that are in need for help or care. The UNRRA helpes people from Europe to China and give them stuff like food, water, and other things becuase of the war that happened in Europe which we call World War 2. My second reason why you should join the UNRRA program is becuase that you get to see other countries or cities that aren't pausible to travel on foot, car, or train. You can get to see other counties like China, Greece, Crete, and even Panama Canal for a matter of fact. My last reason to why you should join the UNRRA program is that there's fun activeities on the UNRRA ship to do. There's vollyball, boxing, table-tennis tornaments, fencing, baseball, whistleing, reading, and other sports or relaxing things to do before we go back to get more supplies for the people in Europe and people in other countries. I hope this paper made you think twice about signing up or joining the UNSSA program. I'll also hope you'll join the UNRRA program sooner or later to help out others in Europe and people from other countries to make them feel safe, cared for, and happy."

Under the 23 Amendment of the constitution, the district of columbia is allocated three electors and treated like a state for pupose of the Electoral college. If you take this away, there will be anarchy all around us, and I assure you that you dont want this to happen. The electoral college is a right for us, and it lets us know that we have a right, and a say in this country. It would be wrong to take that away from us. What have Richard nixon, Jimmy carter, Bob dole, and the AFL-CIO all, in their own time, agreed on? They all agreed on abolishing the electoral college. And they are not the only one's who have said it. According to the gallup poll in 2000, shortly after Al Gore, thanks to the quirks of the electoral collge, won the popular vote but lost because of the 60% of his voters prefered a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. I urge you to please consider your peoples feelings on this matter and consider not abolishing the electoral college. Sincerly, a concerned citizen."

24319,0,"Dear Florida state senator, I argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College. The Electoral College is meant to be a compromise between election of the President by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. I argue for keeping the Electoral College because of several reasons backed up with information. Firstly, I'd like to point out that the Electoral College makes it so that larger states don't have larger influence than smaller states. If the Electoral College is removed then larger states shall have much more political power than smaller states. Which means that a small state might not get the same amount of attention from presidential candidates as a larger state would like Florida. Secondly, the Electoral College avoids Run-off Elections in which no Presidential candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. It avoids that problem because candidates can win Presidency by electoral votes instead of popularity vote. For example, Nixon and Clinton didn't have the majority of the popular votes, but they still won because of electoral votes. If the Electoral College hadn't exist then elections might be more frustrating for everyone, because the Electoral College makes a certainty of outcome. Thirdly, the Electoral College makes sure that a presidential candidate has trans-regional appeal. This is good because a candidate with only regional appeal is probably not going to be a very good president. And besides without the Electoral College there would be many presidents with regional appeal wich would make other states feel left out, and this could be catastrophic to the unity of America. In conlcusion, despite the Electoral College isn't exactly of democratic origins, it still equalizes the political power of states, makes sure that candidates have trans-regional appeal and avoids run-off elections. Overall I say that the Electoral College is very important in keeping how we choose our president balanced and smooth."
24258,0,"Car-Free Cities: ""In German suburb, life goes on without cars,"" ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" and ""Car free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"". This and many more reasons about the advantages of limiting car usage in cities around the world. In many places around the world goberments have been working on plans and laws to reduce car induced smog and pollution. this has brought the creation of entire citites and comunitites as well as country wide bans of car usage in order to reduce smog and other car related problems. For example as in the following excerpt from ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", by Robert Duffer, from the Chigago Tribune. ""After days of near-record pollution, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city... On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day."" the ban was enforced causing up to 4000 drivers to be fined, acording to Reuters (an international news agency), of which some had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine, although thanks to this ban the smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on tuesday I believe that, if the smog could have been reduced so drastically with only one day of partial car baning, then the amount of smog and pollution can be reduced much more with open colaboration from the people all around the world. One mayor discomfort from opposing parties would be ""how can people live without cars?"" But, people are already living without cars as explained in the excerpt ""In German suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", by Elisabeth Rosenthal, form the New York Times. ""VAUBAN, Germany-Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars. Street parking, driveways and home garages are generaly forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban streets are completely car-free -except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park-large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home. As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. -when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,- said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distan motor."" As proven by this excerpt, life without cars is posible and as pleasant to the people living like this as it is good to reduce pollution on cities. Many in Europe have taken the ""Vauban"" way of life for many suburbs in the cities. Another program is the ""Car-Free day"" in Bogota, Colombia. as explained in the excerpt ""Car-Free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" by Andrew Selsky, from the Seattle Times. ""BOGOTA, Colombia-In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, sated or took buses to work during a car free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 milion. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines. -It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,- said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife. For the first time, two other Colombias cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event."" In conclusion, many cities all around the world have problems dealing with pollution generated by cars. taking this universal problem into account the goberments have placed into action plans, laws, and experiments to reduce the pollution on their cities and countrys. life without cars is a posibility that more and more people are trying to turn into a reality. Creatin bans on usage of cars, new holiday-type days without cars to promote the usage of alternative transport methods in various countrys, and even hole cities were cars can't be in. a citie without cars can also be beneficial in taking away stress, reduce unnecesary costs, and in all just having a better life cuality breathing clean and safe air while enjoying the peace and tranquility of and entire citie without cars."

15244,0,"The idea of having driverless cars is interesting. The thought of not having to worry about the dangers of being on the road, when your car is the one doing all of the work for you. There are many positives to having the driverless car, but there are as many negative as there is positive. Sergey Brin, Google cofounds, envisions a future with a public transportation system. He imagines this system to become a form of a public taxi transport. Brin's idea allows the vehicles to use half the fuel that taxis use today and it offers more flexibility than a bus. Google created a car. Google has had cars that could drive under specific conditions and their cars have driven more than half a million miles without having a crash. Now, ideas of the driverless car were sparked up by the idea in movies. Companies have tried to make the driverless car work, but no one has made a driverless car that doesn't need the assistance of the driver, yet. Companies started to question if it wasn't the car that wasn't making their project work and maybe it was the roads that the cars were driving on. In the late 1950s, General Motors created a car that could only run on a special track that was embedded with electrical cables. The cables sent a radio signal to the front of the car. The smart road system worked exceptionally well, but the upgrade to new roads would simply be too expensive. There are many car manufacturing companies working on the progress of making driverless cars happen, but the cars still need the drivers to be on alert to watch out for pedestrians, other motorists and etc. Our form of transportation is evolving right before our own eyes and its quite exciting to know that by the time I'm in college, driverless cars won't just be an idea that I thought would have been nearly impossible to accomplish."
397,0,"Is studying venus a worthy pursuit? Some say that studying venus is a worthy to pursuit because we can find out if it was like earth and many other reasons. Venus is known as the ''evening star'' they call it like this because it is the brighest point in the night sky. The evening star is the second planet from our sun in other words they can be twins. How can they be twins? well they have the same density and around the same size. Now venus is really hard to take a look very close there hasn't been a spaceship down in venus for about three decades. Now here is how the author supprts it. Venus is dangerous for us to look at very closely but Astronomers are fascinated by venus because they think that venus could've been like earth. venus seems to have features that earth has like valleys,mountains and etc. it's worth it because we can see if it was just like earth before and in the bright side we have tools to built somethhing to go to venus and it's scientifically productive. Many missions have been unmanned for many reasons but here is one of the reasons. One we have sent numerous of spaceships in venus and none of them have survived. A atmosphere that is thick is mainly 97 percent carbon dioxide, the clouds are highly corrosive and the temperature is always over 800 degrees fahrenheit. We don't need to send a spaceship the (NASA) have been thinking and studying how to send humans over to venus one way is built a blimp-like vehicle. The vehicle would aviod the ground conditions venus has. We have scientist that can work on how the vehicle can last a long period of time to take a look at venus this can be found in (paragraphs 5,6 and 7). We have people that want to know about venuses history there are reasons holding us up but we have all the resources and we if we need resources we can find a way to make them and have a solution. We have brains and alot if people are willing to go up there and gather up information to kniw it's history what's holding us up? All of us humans have curosity why should we limit our selves because there is danger. That's why the author supports this idea and my explanation of my evidence from the article."

There are pros and cons on working with Venus. I agree with him because if him and his scientest discover things dealing with the phisical in venus or just plane facts it could do well for them. Yet, the cons are extreme. In paragraph 2 it states "" No space craft survived the landing after a few hours."" The space men are going to have to learn new techniques in order to discover and survive. Another detail to go along with that cause is in paragraph 3 where it states "" The conditions are far more extreme then anything humans encounter on earth."" Theres gonna be a lot of tracks the men are going to face and have to learn to adapt. In paragraph 4, it says that "" atronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like thing plamet in our solar system."" Maybe this is why the author suggest to look into it becuase it was once like us. Maybe he wants to know how it change so much. Maybe in the near future we can be able to discover why those things happendand why."
8550,0,"I don't think the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. Sometimes people don't want others to know how their feeling and why their feeling like that. Also, some people might think it's invading their privacy if they didn't give the person permission to read their emotional expressions. Reading other peoples emotional expressions without permission can cause the person to get angry because they might not want others to know how their feeling. I think it would be better to see how the person is acting and if you see that they aren't acting the way they usually do then you can ask them how their feeling or if their okay instead of using technology to read someones emotional expressions. For example, in the text in paragraph 5 it talks about how you can tell how a friend is feeling by the look on their face. Some people don't like others knowing how their feeling because they might think that the person is going to go off and tell others. They might be afraid that their going to make fun of them. Using technology can give you false information if not used properly. It can read that your happy but in reality you can be sad or angry you just aren't showing it because you don't want others to know. Also, it can read that your sad but in reality your trying to show people that your happy so they don't ask you whats wrong. If the person who read your expression through their computer goes up to you and tells you they know that you aren't happy it can make the person feel angry because they were trying so hard not to let people know that they aren't upset. Sometimes just asking someone in person how their feeling can be better than using technology because now and days thats all people use so most people don't communicate in person. Asking someone how they feel can make them feel better if they know they have someoen they can talk to and not through technology. Some people can fake their expressions so using technology won't always be as right as asking someone in person how their actually feeling. These are a couple of reasons why I think the use of technology to read peoples emotional expressions isn't valuable to know how someone is feeling."

This land structure could be a manmade structure and we would never know it. We would never know if othe people made a trip to the moon. Till we have proof this was not a human manmade structure, it will be a mystery till it is prooved. There ar thousands of craters, dents and all kinds of odd looking things on the moon, what makes you think this could be made by someone or something. It will remain a mystery till we know who or what did it."
10991,0,""" This program has been a very good experiance, ''luke has said. I got to learn how to feed the animals and keep watch. It? even better since Don is with me. I think that this Seagoing Cowboy is a great program. Since this is such a great progam I should convince other people that they should join. There are many reasons why. People should join us. People should join the Seagoing Cowboys. The first reason why is that there could be more people feeding the animals,water them two or three times a day. They could make sure thet there was hay for the animals. Also the people can be a watchmen or two. The people could also be night watchman. They could just help others. Some people could go on an other ship and do other jobs there. They can have some animals in a pen. They can have a person to care for them. They could have the same jobs on the first ship but be on another ship so they can deliver the animals and get more done and be able to deliver them at the same rate. ""If I asked more people to come and help it would be a huge opportuinity for them to take. they would get the experiance to serve the ship and do what has to be done,"" said Luke. Everyone who took the chance or job would be a huge help. We could have many ships go out. They could get the job done. So explorers, if you would like to have an adventure this is the job you may want to try. People will realize or they will be aware of people in their countries and their needs. As a group effort people make a difference. This job would be good for you. This job isn't all about hard work. There are some fun things too. You would get to meet other people as well."
24628,0,"Fellow citizens have many advantages if they start limiting car usage. There are many other things a person can do to avoid driving their motor vehicle. Car pooling, public transportation, riding a bicycle, and walking are a few ways you can get to your destination. Car usage is a big problem because of all of the disadvantages it has. The good thing is that by limiting car usgae emissions will lower, we, the people, can conserve resources and improve safety. Lowering emissions has to do with greenhouse gas. Greenhouse gas is any gaseous thing in the atomosphere that is capable of absorbing radiation. It traps and holds heat to the atmosphere. If we lower greenhouse gas then it will prevent the earth from global warming. In source one, the writter says ""Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs and that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions tailpipes."" This line states that automobiles is becoming a hug problem because it uses gas and it causes greenhouse gas emissisions. Conserving resources is an important advantage to limiting car usage. Resouces are what people, plants and animals need. To conserve resources, air pollution can not be a problem but it is because of the dieselsl from cars. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced driving ban to clear the are of the global city."" states, the narrator of source 2. This states that driving a vehicle that contains diesel engines has caused pollution and it has been banned to clear the air in the city. Air pollution is when harmful solid particles and gases mixed in the air. ""pedestrian, bycycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation"" are was to reduce air pollution, explains source 4. Improving saftey is what earth needs to do. Safety is important and if car usage does not limit, people saftey will increase, and not in a good way. We can not continue living with the earth having problems because it will effect our safety. Air pollution will cause us to inhale dangerous particles and that will cause us, the people, to have a bad health. In conclusion, there are many advantages to limiting car usage. There are many different ways from preventing bad things happening. If car usage increases then there will be many problems on earth. We can slowly make a change, avoiding car usage is hard but it must happen."

I was fresh out of high school and, I was working as a grocery clerck and a banker, my buddy Don Reist invited me to go on a boat trip with him.

I got to be a ""Seagoing Cowboy"" my job was to take care of Horses,Cows and', other cattlle while they were being shipped over sea. It is such a great thing to help people out when their life gets hard, you will never know that feeling if you dont try. I am not saying that the job does not have risks. On my second trip i was serving as a watchman, My job was to check all the aniimals every hour. On a rather rainy night I slid down a wet ladder on my back. I shot down with my feet first towards an opening on the side of the ship. Luckily A small strip of metal along the edge of the ship stopped his slide. I couldn't work for a few days but that was fine, at least i wasn't dead. not very many other people can say that their job is a blast. As a ""Seagoing Cowboy"" I got to see a lot of places. I got to tour an excavated castle in Crete and see the Panama Canal. Life on board the ship isn't so bad either. On the return trips we played sports games inside of the empty holds where the animals used to be. So why dont you try being a ""Seagoing Cowboy"" it is an amazing oppurtunity to see sites, help people, and make freinds."

17275,0,"Some people believe that this landform is an alien signal. Sure, it might look like one. That still doesent that it is one. This object in space is just another accidental landform that happened to form there. There are not any alien landforms. There is no actual proof that the aliens have built this structure. Many strange occurances happen. This just happened to be one of them. This is a common thing that occurs on mars. This is just a coincidence that it happened to look like it was an egyptian person. Up close this big rock is just a plain rock. It is just the sun shining on it that makes it look like it is a face. Thats all that it is. Within our article on passage 9 it says that it was super hard to find this one. So that means that there is not that many of this oddly shaped landform. If you really think about it if there were really aliens there they would build more than just one. There needs to be more proof that the aliens built that. This is also common on earth. Some people say that they can see a celebritty in there food. Really it is just some bad shaped food item. We just need some cold hard proof of it. For us it just looks like a big rock that has been there forever. Sure at first it looked suspicious, we did some reasearch on it the realized it was a mesa. There is no need to get so over excited about it. In passage 12 it tells you that we even see these thing on Earth. So really it is just one big rock that is there. It is not some face in the ground that aliens built. Perhaps in the future we could end up discovering something better than this mesa."
20118,0,"I am with the positive aspects of driveless cars for three reasons. People with disabilities can go to their destination. People who are under the influence don't have to drive. Finally, we could save gas and money First, people with disabilities can get to their destination. The driveless car can drive for them. If they can't move their legs, the car can drive. People with hearing or seeing disabilities can have a car that control their every movement. They just need to steer when its necessary. Second, people under the influence don't have to drive the car. Lots of people are dying after getting in a crash crash when a driver is under the influence. If the person that is driving gets intoxicated, the car can drive for them. People are losing their lives because drivers under the influence cannot concentrate on the road. People under the influence of drugs cannot concentrate on the road either. We need this so we can save lives. Finally, we can save money on gas. If we had a smart car, the car can be powered electrically or using solar panels on the car. The cars then do not have to use fuels. We can save the environment. The gas levels will go down, and we can reduce global warming. As the text states, we would use half the fuel a taxi uses today. Later on, we can get rid of fuels and just switch over to more environment-friendly ways to use cars. This is a car that can almost drive itself. We need more smart cars. If these reasons don't convince you, then you have to look into this more. Smart cars are going to be the future. Less lives will be lost if we can get people to use these. The cost of fuel will be less. The future is upon us. Smart cars can mimic humans' driving ability and save us from lots of other stuff. People with disabilties, people under the influence, and saving money on fuel is three ways that smart cars are good for us."
7675,0,"I do not believe that the use of this technology is in anyway practical to read students' emotional expressions. I think this for a couple of reasons. The first one is that, when does this ever see use? In the article it talks about a computer teaching a class, analyzing the emotions of the students, and modifying the lesson to accomadate them. But the issue is, computers do not soley teach classes. It's 2018, we still use teachers to teach. Maybe if this technology was implemented in classes, we would replace teachers with computers, but this starts a whole other list of issues. For a minute, lets say that computers do teach classes, and lets avoid the issues that this alone brings for now. Let's say that the computer decides to scan everyone's face. What happens if someone is not in the classroom, or if they simply aren't looking at the computer? This causes the statistics of the classes emotions to be skewed, and then the class is not acurately accomadated for. The article states, ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" Does this mean normal PC's cannot handle this progream altogether? If so, how expensive are these super PC's? Schools may not be able to afford a PC that can handle this program. Back to the skewing of results. I can almost certainly say that their will be students who hide their emotions. They may not even do it on purpose. For instance, if someone has a straight face, but is still happy, then the computer will misread the emotion and mess up the results. The number one issue with this program being used in a class is that they go off of hard muscle data, they cannot ""read"" the room. A human being teacher can almost certainly ""read"" the room, and understand another human's emotions much better than a computer can. Human teachers have more data to go off of than simply muscle contractions. They can see the context of situations, and know if someone is happy even though they aren't specifically smiling. Going purely off of one source of data is foolish, and would not result in anything good. There is another issue, similar to hiding emotions. It is extremely easy to fake emotion as well. People do it everyday, and if a computer could not differentiate the difference between genuine and fake emotion, this would be exploitable by the class. I'm assuming that, because it goes strictly off of muscle contractions, it could not tell the difference between real and fake emotions, and this would cause many mistakes. Let's say that a class is really not enjoying their lesson, but it is very easy and do not want it to change. In order to do this, all they have to do is pretend to be happy, even though really they are bored. The computer could not tell this, and would continue with the easy, but boring lesson. The issues don't only arise from the program itself, though. If a teacher is not present, and only a computer is teaching, how does the computer keep order? Now you could say that a human is present as well, but I am going off of the text in the passage, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This sentence insinuates that the computer would be replacing the human, as it is an effective replacement. If a teacher is not present, their will be no order in the classroom. How does a computer stop someone from just leaving the class? Or bullying another student? Current AI is no where near the level needed to fully replace a human teacher. In conclusion, although the program may sound fun and interesting, current day technologies simply do not allow it to be practical in a classroom. It presents many more problems than solutions, and this makes it impractical. It would be more useful as a ""gag"" for a single day, just to provide some entertainment with how poorly it performs. Until AI is advanced enough to fully replicate and replace a human being, this technology will never be useful in a classroom."
8456,0,"The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable, I feel this way because it can help on so many ways. In the text kids would ask if this machine really worked, like tthey were intrested in knowing what it was. The computer can help with teachers because if the students are feeling down or something is wrong with them, the system can see whats going on and what type of mood their in so you can try and make them feel better. It also says that the facal expressions are universal, and that using a video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks the facial movements. Thats another way why I feel like this system is helpful to students in a classroom. This system can go so far with so many different things dealing with all types of emotions including mixed emotions. It also goves you examples on how a computer will know if your sad or not, and alot of students in a classroom would find that satisfying. One example to that is saying if you smile whena web ad appears on your screen, a smiliar ad as the first one might follow. But if you frown, the next ad while appear to be different on your screen. I find that so amazing, that theres so many ways in the electronic community just to come up with new out of the world things, and this is one of them. For that, I feel like yes this system is valuable to students in a classroom. But not just one classroom of students, but students from all over the worls. I feel like they would love it and how it works. Not alot of children have the opportunity to try out systems like these, so if they had the chance I think they would take the opportunity in showing that this system is good for everyone. It doesn't even just have to be students, it can also be adults too! I feel like they would also love the system."

13207,0,"The ""Face"" located by three consecutive cameras on Mars is simply a natural landform. Scientists have given the public detailed pictures of the face that support this fact. In addition, the size and location of the landform don't seem to support the fact that the Face is anything living. First of all, scientists sent a spacecraft on April 8, 2001 to take pictures of this landform. In paragraph 10 the text says the following: ""Malin's team captured an extraodinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" This quote supports the fact that the most recent picture of the Face is the most accurate. With that said, the picture that was taken in 2001 shows cracks that seem to be caused by natural effects. The picture no longer resembles a face at all. The picture taken in 1976 is simply way too blurry to be able to draw any conclusions from it. Scientists and the public should trust this picture because it has the best quality out of all the pictures. The only explanation that scientists would be able to provide is that it is just a natural landform because of the size of it. In paragraph 1, the text clearly states the following: ""enormous head nearly 2 miles from end to end"". This piece of text supports the fact that the Face is a landform because it is common for landforms to be large in size. It would be highly unlikely and odd if someone or something's face was 2 miles in size. In addition to the size, there also have not been any other ""faces"" spotted on Mars. If this really was a living creature, it would have had to have a mother or a father or atleast some other creature to help it survive. Think about it, a creature needs atleast some type of family to be able to be born. Since this is the only resemblance of living life on this planet, it seems almost impossible that this animal would have been able to survive on its own. If we had found other pictures that resembled a face, then it would have been a different story. Lastly, the landform has obviously stayed in the same place for the past 25 years. If this happened to be a picture of a currently living creature, it seems almost impossible for it to not move at all in 25 years. A living thing would mostly have to migrate or hibernate, or at the least change positions. Although landforms on the other hand, almost always leave long-lasting impression on the land. Therefore, the pictures, size, and location of the mark on Mars seem to lead scientists to believe that the Face is just a natural landform. The chances of it being an animals that hasn't moved in 25 years and has a head 2 miles long just make it seem too unlikely that this could have been a living creature."
6976,0,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, he talks about new technology that can identify human emotions. This new technology, the Facial Action Coding System, is not relevant for children in classrooms because it is not needed, a disruption, and not trustworthy. Although, the Facial Action Coding System in unique it is disruptive to a class. The article says that this new system could help kids with their learning by ""recognizing when a student becomes confused or bored."" The computer would then have to alert the teacher and disrupt the class while learning and everyone then would be confused. There would also be computers all around the class and kids would most likely pay more attention to those instead of their lesson. All of this new technology seems cool but can people trust it? This computer ""constructs a 3-D computer model of the face"" and from that it base a persons emotions by facial expressions. That is not something people could really trust. A person could easily smile and really be sad but the computer thinks the person is happy because they smiled. The computer also only know happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness but what about other emotions like depression? There could be a flaw in the system and could label people as ""confused"" and have their teacher think they don't understand a lesson in school even though they do. This technology is not really needed at all. The article says, ""humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" everyday,"" what is the point of having a computer do a job that a human can easily do? This new system is more of a accessory than it is a help. People would just be paying for something they could do themselves.

And if somethings fun and easy, and you get paid for it why not try it out? So I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys. One reason that you should join is because you could see some amazing sights as well as visit different countries, such as China, Italy, and Europe. Some sights that you may see would be the Elfell Tower, or roads made out of water, but only if you join. Another reason is that after you dropped the animals off you could do some activities on the way back, like fencing, baseball, volleyball, whittling, and table tennis tournaments. That sounds like more than fun time by my standards. I know some may say that they wouldn't do it because of sea sickness or others might say that it would be too dangerous because of bad wheather, but you can overcome sea sickness and the boats you're going to be on are made to withstand bad wheather. Plus I'm pretty sure that if the wheather's going to be bad we're not going to be sent out in it with the risk of losing cattle or horses. Wow, all these things sure do want to make me hop aboard.

5083,0,"Children in the near future could learn in new and exciting ways! The use of the Facial Action Coding System can help children learn lessons that they may not understand in a classrom with one teaching method. This can be excellent for helping children with special needs, finding out how children learn best, and keeping certain problems at a low. I'd say that this can be a revolutionary change for the learning process. Children with special needs, such as ADHD, could be able to learn beter. The machine would be able to read their expression while learning and find a way to keep them on the track they need to go. This could help people with downs too! They could calculate their expression and change the way of teaching to make them better understand what is being taought because some aren't too good at communicating verbally. FACS could help regular chindren learn better too! They could be taought a small lesson on individual devices with FACS on it, while they learn their emotions can be calculated to test to see what way of learning best suits them. They could to this for about 10-15 minutes a day with different teaching methods. After a few weeks the computer should know what method works best for each individual student. At that poiont the time taken could teach each student indeviduallly what they need to know in the way that works best for them and can improve test scores. The system can keep ""troubble"" or problems at a low. This device could keep the attention of the ""troubble makers"" so they dont have to gain attention elsewhere by having lessons that seem to be more fun to the child. It can also tell when a student is lying about important things like bullying and harrassment. FACS can help children with drepression too! A big problem with teens and pre-teens is that the stress of school can cause depression. The article states that pecticing emotions can make u feel that emotion. Children can go to a counselor and have their emotion read then have proper exercises to improve their emotion. In conclusion, FACS can help multiple probles in the learning space. It can inprove learning for children and those with special needs. It can keep certaiain problems such as troubble making children at a low. It can also help children find a way of learning that best suits them. Overall FACS cn make the learning environment a better, more fun place."
5994,0,"Values of Facial Action Coding Software Being able to actually know what a person's emotion has been a struggle for most people. Not knowing how a family member or friend is feeling is very hard on someone that is trying to help or understand. The facial action coding software is how you can know. This system was created by Professor Thomas Huang. The software uses technology that uses the 44 major muscles in the human face to determine one's emotion. You might be asking why this is important to our everyday lives. Determining the emotion of someone or something is very valauble because of the ease of finding how a person feels, the ease of finding how different types of art work is suppose to feel, and the benefits of technological improvements towards your everyday use. This software is key to our future. The facial action coding software is valuable because it can determine one's emotion. All humans have all different types of emotions. These emotions can take over one's healthy state of mind. A vast majority of people do not say how they feel, which causes themselves to do very unhealthy things. An example of this is a person feeling depressed. This depression they feel make them want to take anit-depressants. This person could later get addicted and become a drug addict. Another example is a person feeling angry, which causes them to take their anger out on other people. All of these emotions can be helped by having one talk about it, but most people don't do that. The facial action coding software can alert people of when someone is feeling a certain way. This could easily lead to the person who is feeling depressed or angry getting help. This could improve a persons well-being or save their life. This software can is also valuable becuase it can depict the emotions in art work. Everyday people get confused by the emtion of people in artwork. This system can help people understand what the emotion the person in the art is showing. An example of this is the famous painting the, ""Mona Lisa."" In the first paragraph of the article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,""it says the Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. These numbers have been calcuated by the facial action coding software. This software now allows people to know that the Mona Lisa painting expresses a litte fear and anger. The facial action coding software is also valuable to the future of other technology. Technology like computers and smart phones are always getting better and better. Imagine the power some technology could have if the software was used with it. In paragraph 6 of the article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author discusses how school tests can use this software to learn what you like and dislike. Dr. Hang states, ""A classroom compiter could regocnize when a student is becoming confused or bored...then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Children could have a better learning experience through this software. The facial action coding software is very important to our future lives. The software is valuable because people can know and understand people, art work, and it can improve technology. This software is key to our future. Wouldn't you want to help out a friend during tough times, or even help children learn better?"
11125,0,Are driverless cars in the near future? Driver less cars have been around science 2009 longer if you count Gener Motors smart roads from the 1950's.In hiensight i belive selfdriving cars have been around for a while and will contiue to play an important role in today's world. I belive that they will countinue to play a more effective role in are lives. I can see a future with driverless cars because i belive that they have many more applications than just simpily being a self driveing car. I can see a future where driverless cars pick up the elederly or the sick which can not drive any more and take them to werever they desier. As is also dipicted by google cofounder Sergey Brin. He dipicks this when he says that he has imagined a fleet of self driving public transportation vesseles. In many ways smart cars aremore reliable than human operated motor vechiles. I also belive that there cons to automated cars. I belive that nothing compares to a human drivers experince and knowledge of what the other person may be thinking. Were as with an automitated machine they can only be programed with sanourous. Ther are also case in which a computer can crash and fail just like a lap top causing the inhabitant of the vechile to have to take over sudenely. Like wise a human can fall asleep at the wheel of a regular car and cause major damage. Where as if they were in an autominous car the assist would be able to take control of the vechile and properley pull to the side of the rode. Self driving cars have many safety features on theme some of the safety features are even on many military ships such as the cars LIDAR. Which is a radar used to map under water tunels for scuba divers and the navy. Self driving cars have the power of antilock breaks and lane assist. It even has onbrd navstare. Even with the features and many more in some areas of the country it is still ilegal to even test drive self driving cars. In many cases i belive that driverless cars are coming in the future weather we would like theme to or not. Which is why i stand with driverless cars. I hold this stance because i amagin a time where counstriction equiement can run its self up and down dangerous areas of path in stead of leaving the dangerous job to humans. Not only do i belive that autonmius cars can save human live but they can also make lifes little chores easier.

Another reason i think we should cut down on car use or at least car pull in vans is cause it will leave less emissions in the air and it'll hopefully help the ozone layer repair itself to its natural state And in conclussion im all for it cause I think that it'll help people get out and get fit and there will be less crashes there be less stress from driving(roadrage/roadragers)."

In this response I am going to explain why this is what I chose and my understanding for the others opinions. My first example why I am against these cars is because we, as a country, have people who take advantage of the things we have and how they are supposed to be used. For example what if a parent lets the kid sit in the drivers seat and lets them ""drive"" per say because the car can drive on it's own. What if their is an emergancy, you can not move your child quick enough to move out of the way. Theres two lives because we were so self dependant on these cars. My second example why I am against these cars is because, us as people get tired and what if someone, say has been driving all night, wanted to take a quick nap. Let's say this nap turns into a good rest and the person is deeply sleeping. What if that person does not wake up in case of an emergancy and the person gets into a crash? That is risking your own life and other lives around you. My Last example why I am against these cars is because, what if their is a sortage in the technology? Say the person is texting on their phone and not paying attention and relies on that signal to keep them aware of the road condions and any in coming problems in the way. Well say there is a sortage and the signal is not going off and the person is unaware of what is going on around him. There goes another crash and another life that did not need to be wasted because of a car. In conclusion, we should think twice about these cars in our community and how they will affect lives around us. I see why some people may like the ideas of these cars, because it is less fuel used and less money spent but is that really worth the chance of losing your lives? This is what I believe about the driverless cars and why I believe them."
21818,0,"Dear senator of Florida, I am writing an argument in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. I feel that you should make it more clear to the people that vote. The people should know who and what they are voting for, which some people get confused. ""...sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes..."" If people keep voting for the wrong candidate soon they will realize and the senator of Florida will be recieving more than one letter. With the electora doing a ""winner-take-all"" system then, its not really fair to the people. Every state in the United States should absolutely get a chance to see a single campaign ad. ""...seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all,including Rhode Island and South Carolina..."" I dont think you should abolish the electoral college, after all its not so bad. You should just do better and get all around the United States not just a couple of states, ALL!! Sincerly, PROPER_NAME"

The author thinks studying Venus is good. Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. Venus is sometimes right aroumd the corner- in space terms- humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud- draped world. Not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, tempertures averange over 800 degrees Faherenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we expierience on our own planet. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on it's surface. Astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. What i kearned is that venus is a dangerous planet and nobody can go there because they will die. People tried to go to Venus but they couldn't go."
18049,0,"In 1976, a spacecraft from NASA called ""Viking 1"" caught a photo on Mars of something that looked like a face. Some scientist and people believe that this ""face"" is an artifact built/made by something or someone like aliens. Others believe that it is just a natural landform built by nautral things like wind and rain. I belive that this thing on Mars is just another landform that just so happens to look like a face. First of all, NASA is a very highly known space agency program that has achieved many great things like getting the first people on the moon. To make a mistake of not knowing if something a a landform or not is something BIG. NASA has many intelligent scientists to look over stuff and help out. Secondly, if it was a face that was built by something like aliens, where are they? How do you find this big mesa in the middle of a planet and can't find the ""people"" who did it? How can you make the assumption of something making a giant ""artifact"" when you don't even know who did it? Most importantly, NASA's spacecraft ""Mars Gtlobal Surveyor"" (MGS) has flown out on April 5, 1998, to take a picuture after analyzing it, they said it was a landform. Many people were not satisfied and said that it the picture couldn't have been taken well because it was during the Winter--a cloudy time for the planet. On April 8, 2001, the MGS too another picture of the strange land. It was hard for NASA because they normally don't pass over the face often. That day was a cloudless summer day, and they captured an extrodanary photo using the camera's maximum resolution. This photo showed that there was nothing that proved that there was any sort of life around it. It really just showed that it was the equivalent of a buttle or a mesa that is common around the American West. In conclusion, I believe that this ""face"" on the planet is just a simple landform that is like a mesa. I think it would be hard for a very well program like NASA to mistake something like this. There have been many pictures taken and there have been no signs of life near the landform, and it is almost just like any other piece of rock and sand that sticks out of the ground."
19888,0,"Driverless cars are becoming very popular in modern society. These cars are the turning point in society as humans lean more towards technology. Humans can benefit from these cars in numerous ways. Driverless cars should be developed because of the benefits such as protection that humans receive. Protection is a major problem in our society today dealing with cars. Accidents happen in a blink of an eye without an prior warning. With driverless cars, there are sensors and antilock brakes that alert the driver when trouble is ahead. The antilock brakes helps control the vehicle through the dangers of the road far better than people can. Sensors help make driving safer for drivers and passengers because of the advance improvements to computer hardware and software. In additon, the driverless car helps improvement not only the safety of the drivers and passengers, but driving itself. Driverless cars can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves. However, certain situations such work zones and accidents are unfamilar to the sensors of the vehicle and will require human skill. Though driverless cars can operate themselves, they still require the basic human driving skills for certain reason. Humans are still required to drive regardless of the technology presented in the future. In contrast, people would agrue that the development of driverless cars will cause more damage than improvement. They would say that if the technology from the car fails to alert the driver of any dangers that conflicts will arise between manufacturers and drivers because of the control of the vehicle. However, if a driver decides to not follow the rules of the road because the advance technology, then the driver should be held responsible for the effects of their actions. The driverless car is created to help driving. A person still be fully alert at all times while driving as if they are driving. Otherwise, that person should not be operating any type of vehicle with complex technology such as the driverless car. The development for driverless cars should be approved because of the many benefits humans will have while operating them the cars. Protection is critically needed in this era as well as the advancement of vehicles. However, humans must be able to understand that it's their responsiblity to be mature and focus while driving. Though they may not be driving, its still good to always be prepared for anything. Driverless cars are very futuristic, but looking ahead isn't bad when we are always looking forward on the road."
17223,0,"Driverless cars are a new and upcoming thing in our world today. Drivers having to constantly steer and brake is a thing of the past. Now, cars drive themselves and humans are no more required to be the drivers, but the passengers. But many people don't believe that this is the road we should go down. Could going completely driverless put humans in even more danger than we are today? After reading the article, development of driverless cars should be stopped because they cause more crashes, prove technology is unreliable, and show that who to put at blame is unknown and will cause problems. Development of driverless cars need to be stopped. These cars not only seem to not need human drivers, but means that we're in trusting these cars with our lives. Today, car accidents are a variety of reckless driving, simple mistakes, etc. But what they have in common is they're all accidents that humans have committed. In the article, paragraph 7, it says humans will be notified by the car when a situation gets too complicated or diffcult for it to handle. But by the time the car notifies the passenger, won't it be too late for the human to react and take over? Driverless cars putting us humans in situations like this will only cause panic for us, when we aren't even suppose to be driving, but passengers, and cause even more crashes. Driverless cars don't need to be developed because they'll just put us in more danger than we're already in. Technology is the main component these driverless cars utilize to actually be able to drive by themselves. In paragraph 5 it says, ""The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on the individual wheels and reduce power from the engine..."" In our world today, technology and manufactured devices malfunction all the time. It's just what happens because humans don't know everything there is to know about everything. What if to say this happened to the sensors in the driverless cars. If the sensors just stop working, causing the car to stop, putting the passenger in a great amount of danger. Technology isn't reliable, so why should we have to rely on technology to drive our cars? It's just more danger being caused instead of being prevented if we develop these cars. We should rely on ourselves to drive our cars instead of technology because it can just malfunction at anytime, without a warning. Directly in the article, in paragraph 9, it posed the question: ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault - the driver or the manufacturer?"" This is a very important question because it's basically asking who's taking the blame if someone is injured by these driverless cars? This could all be avoided if we stop the development of those cars. Forsay, if someone's injured, would the guilt lie on the passenger who's suppose to be watching the driverless car drive or the manufacturers who made the car in the first place? Chaos and problems will arise if this situation takes place. Both people should be at fault though because they're giving technology the wheel and the path to do what it want, even if it's programmed to do one thing. But like I said before, these accidents and questioning who's at fault can be avoided if we take away what causing this all: technology. Stopping production of these cars will take the blame away and make accidents more clearer as who's to blame. The idea of having driverless cars in our world today isn't not going to go away anytime soon, but proving why it shouldn't be develop and not even being an idea anymore can keep them from being a thing in our world to come. Driverless cars not only take the control out of the driver, but take control of the fate of the passengers' lives too. Development of driverless cars should be stopped because they cause more accidents, prove technology is unreliable, and cause questions of who's at fault for crashes. Taking driverless cars out of our streets and sticking to man-driven cars will make the world a safer place not only now, but for our future too."

The Seagoing Cowboys helped take care of cows,hores, and mules that where over seas. Luke was 18 before arriving in Greece, that ment he could sing up for miliary service. He was on his cattle-boat trip when he signe u for the miliary. They had plenty of food and water to feed the anmials and themselves. When you are a Seagoing Cowboy you get to travel a lot of places. Luck had been on 19 trips before they discharged him in 1947. If you like traveling then this is for you. They went all the way to China and it took them one whole month. They went to a lot of different places. Luck though all of his trips where very special. Luck had come a long way since he was a kid. Luck grew up in in the country. He helped his aunt Katie out on the farm. He didn't have the best life when he was a kid. When Luke became a Seagoing Cowboy it opened up the world for him. When Luke was a Seagoing Cowboy it was much more than an advernture even though he did travel a lot. Luke was very greatful for the opportunity. Luke saw that other countries don't have a lot of stuff like we do. He saw that they where in need. That awareness stayed with him almost his whole life. Luke didn't just work he had a lot of fun on board. They played a lot of games like fencing, boxing, table-tennis tournaments, games, reading, and whittling made the time go by pretty quick. It was a lot easier to play the games when the animals where unloaded. He sometimes went to places where war had just ended to help them in need. They also played baseball and volleyball games in the empty spaces where the animals usest to be. Luke was a very kind harted person. He never though about just himself. He would go back and do it all over again. Luke was a very thoughful person. Tell me would you ever be a Seagoing Cowboy."
12905,0,"Driveless cars can bring about a new generation to the world of technology. Driveless cars allow ¨drivers¨ to transport without actually driving.These cars can lead to new technologies such as, cars that run on water or even flying cars. With this new knowledge of technology future generations can have an easier, futuristic lifestyle. Although driveless cars can be easier and bring forth new technological advances, they may be dangerous. These new cars may seem very cool and exciting, but they can be dangerous to the one ¨driving"" the car, or the people around the car. This means the driver would still need to be attentive to all things going on. As the passage states in paragraph 7, ¨all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navagating through work zones and around accident.¨ This means drivers cannot doze off as they make their way to their designation. Although there may be alerts for the driver it still may not work. For instance, if the driver were to fall asleep and the alrerts couldn´t wake up the driver causing them to crash or hit someone unexpectedally crossing the street. Another example could be if an error occurred within the car and didn´t alert the driver fast enough or at all. Furthermore with the possibility of these accidents occuring, who would be the one to blame for this mishap? As the passage states ¨If the new technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?¨ With this being said, many arguments can arise. Who is the one to blame? If driveless cars requires the driver to be just as attentive as a driver in a normal car, is the driveless car really worth it? With these arguments in place, new laws would need to be made in order to cover liability. There are still many things to figure out about driveless cars such as, safety issues and the new laws that would need to be brought about. These driveless cars could lead to new advances in future car models, but are they safe enough to bring into the new world? Another downside is having to figure out laws for who would take the blame if an accident were to occur. With these issues to keep in mind, the driveless car can be improved for a more safer and reliable experience."
10101,0,"Whether you are someone who believes conspiracy theories, or are just plain stupid and think that somehow the Face is evidence of alien life, you are still wrong. It's just a rock, a plain, thousands of years old, heap of rock. The End, no ""Ifs, ands, or buts"", there is evidence saying that this is just a mesa, a landform, we have picture proof of it. However, considering that I must write this for Mr. Toad's Wild Ride, I still have to argue about it pointlessly with an imaginary person who might or might not exist. So, I will cover two major points to prove to you that it's a landform, common sense, and the facts that we here at NASA have proven to be true. First off, this argument is over whether Face was created by aliens, or whether it is just a natural landform. This is a pretty strange argumental topic, as people who believe this stuff anyway will hardly be convinced by a random scientist at NASA. Anyway, there is proof we have that face is just a natural landform, we have taken multiple pictues of it, and have concluded that, as shown with this cite of evidence, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the America West."" We can even say that it was not obscured by any clouds or haze because it was clear day on Mars the day the picture was taken. That should be the end of the discussion, but yet you say, ""But Mister science man, what if the pictures that you took couldn't see it because it was too small?"" Well, that point can actually be rebuted as well, because of what Jim Garvin, the chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, said, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixer size,"" he added. ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"". Factually that should be the end of it, it was a clear picture, that was enhanced for farther detail, on a clear day, with a high resolution camera. Don't think I don't see you thinking, ""But will a only a photo actually be able to properly discern whether this is natural."" Well......no, it won't. Actually, you have me entirely beat on the fact that it simply could be a landform, made by aliens. Yes, there I admit it, sit at home and laugh at the fact that I could be wrong. Look, Mister Whoever reads this for a job, I argue for a living with my friend, and there is simply not enough evidence to actually say that there is no way that this is not alien made. There is actually a chance, somewhere, somehow, a superficially small chance that aliens might have had someplay in this. I know that all sounds crazy, but seriously, think about it. All we have is some lously picture that, while it shows us the exteriror, it doesn't show us anything about the interior of the landform. Here is the other side to the point I just made, think about this rationally for a second, could aliens really have made a monument or some strange thing on Mars, only for it to be found by humans? Probably not, and all of this is so improbable that I really don't even need to write an argumentative essay about it anyway. There is an extremely small and slim chance that aliens had any part in making a mesa on Mars. So all in all, there is factual proof we have, cited from the text I was given to say that aliens had no part in the making of Face, and that it is a natural landform. However, it isn't concrete proof, so for all we now it could be an alien itself. I have no idea, and neither will you. Again though, rationally, it has no relation to aliens. So that's all I got, the end."
9627,0,"In this essay i will be explaining why I am for driverless cars. Although driverless cars may seem bad in the begining it's really not. Most people now and these days need driverless cars for may reasons. I will be talking about the very postive aspects about the topic. My position on driverless cars would to suporrt it in my case. Having a driverless car means you can do alot more things while you are in the car. Say if u are in elder and you need to go pick up the some things from the store but you do not enjoy driving the driverless car and help you out perfectly. I believe that if you are sick and you had a person in the household to help you and they are not quite ready to drive, they can go get anything you need from the store with them getting into an accident. Even though we might not be able to control other drivers and the driverless cars might hsve some problems with it. I still believe thats driverless cars are good. In the passage it states that ""Google's modifeied Toyata Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver and an interial motion sensor'. It also has a 3-D model sprinning sensor on the roof to constantly update the car's surroundings. All of these combine together is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel. The driverless car will make the roads much safer for other drivers, passengers and pedestrians. If everyone gets a driverless car it should be less accidents on the road. Safety is the key. In the passage it states thats ""Some manufactues hope to do that by bringing in-car enterainment and information systems that use heads-up displays.Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over."" With the new in-car system it is actually a safety feature. In conculsion, altough people may think that driverless cars are a terrible idea.I'll would have to say that I am against that and say that that the driverless car is a pretty good idea. For an example,what if u had to drive a 9 hour with no breaks that driverless car can do half of the work for u while u are eating or maybe even taking a powernap. It can make road trips easy for you and others. The roads will be safer and our lives will be too.""The road to the truly automonus car stretches on ahead of us, but we grow closer to the destination every day"""
23052,0,"Cars are not the most important thing in our lives. Although cars are helpful, not having one can help you a lot in the long run. Having a car causes so much stress worrying about the traffic if you're going to be late for work or school, gas prices are not as low as people would like. If you had to walk everywhere or ride your bike, you could be getting a lot of exercise from it. People think having a car is so important but they dont see the positive side to it. Many people stress out if they are not going to make it to work on time because of traffic, I know that I dont make it to school on time because of all the traffic trying to get into my school is horrible. Instead of stressing out, you can just go on a calm walk or bike ride to your destination. In the article written by, Elisabeth Rosenthal, there is a quote from Heidrun Walter saying, ""when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" because they had banned cars in his city. You can always find an alternative way of getting to where you need to go. If someone has a meeting to go to, they can always use the alternative of the Internet if they cant get their in time or the weather is not the best. Instead of stressing out about driving, you can walk to your destination and save money from not paying for gas. We all know that gas prices are high and out of our budget. They've reached four dollars, that's insane! Why would anyone want to spend that money if they don't have to. There is a simple solution on saving your money that you waste on gas, and that is walking or riding your bike. Some people can afford the prices of gas but others are struggling in the economy but are to lazy to walk, nobody wants to get exercise so they drive everywhere. Banning cars on the street is a good way to help people get exercise. If they know they can't drive, they would obviously walk or take a bike because they have places to be. It would be an effective way to get people to stop being lazy and helping their health. Some people would probably get frustrated because they have to walk everywhere but it's only helping them. Walking or riding a bike is a good opportunity to realize the beauty of life without stressing out over bad drivers or traffic, saving money, and getting exercise. Most people would think banning cars on the street is a good idea for those few reasons. I know that it is super effective although some people may not see it until it actually changes."
21490,0,"There has been a fuss about the Elector College. Many people get confused about how it works and if they're satifyied with the whole process. Show we ""abolish"" the Elector College? Should we keep it? Honestly we should keep it. We the peope have more then enough control on who is chosen for the president of the United States Of America. We don't really vote for the president but our vote impacts the decision. Many citizens of the United States Of America think their vote doesnt matter, it does. Why? Well, first the government is runned by the people. Its very rare to not get the president that has the most popular votes, the last time when the president wasn't chosen was in 1888. It's less likely for the president with the most votes to lose the election. For example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the elector votes compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney. Plus, almost all states award elector votes on a winner-take-it-all basis. Perhaps, there was no system. Would it be simpler? Yes it would but we have to also be fair, there is 538 electors and a majority of 270 elector votes is required to elect the president. When you are voting for the president ypu want to win,you are actually voting for your canidate's elector. How does the system work? First it's the process that has the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for the president and vice president, and last but not least the counting of electoral votes by congress. Obviously it is kind of confusing because it would be much simpler if the winner would be the one with the most popular votes. Did you know that the Elector College avoids the problem of elections? They do due to how much pressure the candidte can go through. It can easily complicate the presidential process. For instance, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Elector College (301 and 370 elector votes exactly). When avoiding the elections and campaigns, there a better chance of clear winner. So there you have it,three main reason's why we should keep the Elector College. We have why the process is important and why we have it. How the process work's because it was confusing to many people, so it's defined and hopefully you'll like to stay and support the Elector College. Your vote does matter."
15735,0,"The Face On Mars Have you ever seen something crazy on something, maybe a face or something that you seen before? Have you thought about how that face or something else has gotten there? Well, for a start it defintley wasn't aliens! Just like the face on mars, people belive that the face was created by aliens! But that isn't true, the face on mars is just and only a natural landform that some how was created on earth. For my first reason on why the face on Mars is just a natural landform is because NASA later revelied that the face was not made of aliens, but by shadows. A few days after that image was found, NASA needed to take a look and figure out what made this incredible and scientififc picture so unique, and why and how it was formed. Later on, they have came up with an good explaination about this unique image. NASA said this,""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Scientifically, the face was made from a natural cause, so it makes it a very different natural landform. Now, for my second reason on why this was not made by aliens, but just a natural landform is that there is no scientific research showing that aliens do exist and created this face. Now I do know that some people say that they have seen aliens, but scientists dont think that is one hundred percent true because they don't have any evidence suggesting that aliens are real. Many people to belive in them, but how do we know that they are actually real without any scientific knowledge? But now after NASA did some research, they found out that even though we don't have information about them, aliens did not create that face, it was only a natural landform. For my third and final reason, why the face was not created by aliens and is only a natural landform, is because in the last paragraph,paragraph twelve, they talk about how the the picture actually shows that it is the Martian equvialent of a butte or mesa. Since the landform shows a butte or mesa, that means that the image was a major landform that came from the American West. Garvin says, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" He also said,"" That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" So, this is not only a natural landform, but a major natural landform. I do agree a little bit about aliens creating the face. Maybesomewhere in space, there are aliens that created something else or not. One day maybe we can find something out in space that has something to do with aliens, but today is just isn't the day to do that. But overall, i would have to agree that aliens did not create this, but this is only a natural landform created by something other than aliens. As you can see, this creative landform was most defintley not created from aliens, but just a nice natural landform. Scientists now figured out that this ""Face on Mars"" is from shadows and not from aliens. This landform is actually a butte or a mesa which is very intersting to have found out. Many people did belive that the ""Face on Mars"" was created by aliens, but scientists haven't found out if there are aliens or not, so we shouldn't jump into conclusion. But overall, this face was defintely a landform and not created by aliens!!"

7199,0,The technology is valuable for many reasons. One of the reasons being is that the latest innovation is being used to make it. A second reason is because it can make characters in video games seem more expressive. It would be better for humans that can not talk. Reading students facial expressions could help see if they need help or go to the councilars office. Using this technology teachers can use it to see if their students are confused or lost while doing their work. If a student is angry it can read their facial expression then the teacher could send them out into the hall. The technology could even possibly know when a fight is about to happen between two students reading their facial expressions. Empathy can happen when using this technology. It can be used to see if someone is lying or telling the truth. Lastly it can be used to conduct a classroom. If a student is tired the teacher would know to wake them up.
11101,0,"Driverless cars definately should be considered for the future. There are many ways that driverless cars are an improvement from human driven cars. There may be some cons to driverless cars, however the pros surely outweigh them. By developing driverless cars, fuel would be saved because they only use about half the amount of fuel normal cars use. The driverless cars also offer more flexibility than a bus for the public transport system would. The driverless cars have the option for a human to take over the driving, if needed, so these cars do have safe features. There are several sensors on these driverless cars, which resolves in better response and control than a human driver could possibly have while driving. In the future, when they are developed more, driverless cars could be very helpful and useful for people. They are definately an improvement, and will be even more so when they have more developments. Driverless cars should for sure be used in the future."
5582,0,"Human emotion can be expressed by many things such as body language, tone, and language. Emotion allows us to understand others and empathize easier. A software known as Facial Action Coding System has been developed to improve accuracy of calculating the emotions of others. Using this technology to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is invaluable because humans already can ""calculate"" emotions, the classroom is not taught by a computer, and human emotions are very complex. The first reason that the FACS is invaluable to the classroom is because there is no need to use technology to ""calculate"" emotions of a student. A classroom consists of a teacher and several students which are humans. The author stated within the article, ""humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day,"" He further on states that we can probably tell how a friend feels just by the look on their face. Since humans can already perceive and understand emotions of others, there is no need for a mode of technology to figure out when someone is bored or confused about certain subjects in a classroom. When a student is bored or confused about a certain subject, he or she could simply ask for help from a teacher or a peer. Using the FACS technology would be redundant in reading emotional expressions of students; Therefore, it is invaluable technology. Computers are not what teach students in a classroom. The author tells the reader to imagine a classroom computer that could recognize your emotions, so it could ""modify the lesson like an effective human instructor."" There is always a human instrcutor( the teacher) in a classroom, so there should not be a need for a modification of a lesson by a computer when the teacher can modify the lesson. Students do not need to be dependent on a computer to learn what they need to learn in a classroom, and a computer that can calculate emotion is obsolete by its uselessness in the manner of learning. The final reason why emotion calculating technology is invaluable in a classroom is that emotion is too complex for just a classroom computer to calculate. First of all, emotion differs from person to person. In the aritcle Dr. Huang, a professor of the University of Amsterdam, said, ""The facial expression for each emotion are universal,"" but he also stated, ""individuals often show varying degrees of expression."" If emotional expressions are all unique, it would be very difficult for computers to calculate the exact feeling a students is feeling just by their facial expression. Also, in the seventh paragraph, the author stated, ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" This means that the classroom computer would not be able to calculate like how it was used in the article. In conclusion, the FACS is too redundant and under developed to be of any use for a classroom enviorment. It is invaluable and there are mulitple substitutes that can read emotional expressions of students in a school. In the future, with further innovations, there will be a time where classrooms use this type of technology to enhance education; but as of right now, the system is not useful for helping classrooms teach students."
12089,0,"Hello, my name is Capri. I will be arguing against the use of Driverless cars. In the passage it talks alot about how the new smart cars/ driverless cars have been here since 2009. I think that it is a smart and useful invention. But I really dont think we are quite ready for it right now, especially since it comes with a few flaws. Our normal cars are even getting call backs so imagine what what would happen if you weren't fully in control of our vehicles. It says in the passage that it isnt fully driverless which to me signifies that we shouldnt be using something that isnt living up to the invention purpose. Its going to be electrical so what if there is a bug or virus in the system that cant handle driving or wont let us drive at all. This could result in serious accident or injury. Yes I think that this is a brilliant invention I just think that it shouldnt be displayed or used until we are 110% that is comepletely safe and ready to be driven. For example what if I, Capri, was married to John and we had a son. we could be driving in a driverless car and it could flash for one of us to take over and steer, but the vehicle is malfunctioning and not letting us drive. We crash, have to pay fees, insurance ect... What if they saw us as we were the cause of the accident but it all was because of a faulty system that wasnt ready to be used. So i say no we should not use driverless cars, it is hazardous, just like a regular car. We should be inventing something that is safer than a car not equal or less safe."
15709,0,"Have you ever gtten your hopes up for something special, but you secretly knew you wouldn't get what you wanted? That is how some felt once they discovered the ""Face on Mars"" wasn't actually a face. Many convincing facts led NASA's employees to believe this natural landform was actually a human face. However, there just so happened to be a few more facts and pieces of evidence to tell otherwise. In September of 1997, Cydonia became NASA's number one priority when Mars Global Surveyor arrived to the Red Planet. The article says this was eighteen long years after the Vikings missions ended. Jim Garvin explaines how they felt this landform was important to taxpayers and they photographed the Face as soon as they could get a good shot at it. Beacause this mysterious form exsited and NASA payed so much attention to it, it shows that they only used solid facts to explain how this landform was created naturally and not by aliens. It was not until Apri 5, 1998, a year after Cydonia became their priority, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, as stated in the article. It also says Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture which was ten time sharper than the original Viking photos. This comes to show that NASA did not just go off one photo taken eighteen years before hand. Eager web surfers were anxious to find out something juicy, such as alien life form on Mars, but to their surprise the Face had occured naturally. The web surfers and many other people were not satisfied with the outcome and were not going to give up on their hopes, but neither was NASA. The critics said how the ""Face on Mars"" is located 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was cloudy on Mars when the photo was taken. NASA then prepared to look again. Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001 Mars Global Surveyor drew in closer for a second time. Garvin stated, ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of veiw."" The pixels in the most recent pictures taken spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixels in the best 1976 Viking photo. Garvin also adds how you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. This means that it is the clearest image you could take and if there just so happened to be things such as airplanes on the ground, Egyptian-style pyramids, or even small shacks the picture could have clearly captured them. Although many wanted to believe the Face was anything but a natural landform, NASA used strong facts and evidence to fight the arguement and convince people otherwise. I strongly believe The Face on Mars is natural and was not created otherwise because they used all facts and has three different pictures one of which could have spotted things other than the landform, but did not. Nothing but the truth was caught on camera and that is that the ""Face on Mars"" is nothing but a natural landform, and nothing more."

Luke was 18 before he arived in Greece which meant he could be drafted for military service. When the draft board learned he was on a cattle baot trip they said that he was able to keep going on the cattle boat trip. The cattle boat trip was an unbeleivable opportunity for a small towns boy like hime. Luke helped out on his aunt Katie's farm whch prepared him for hard work but not for the dangers at sea. Luke also found a way to have fun on board even on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. When Luke got home he was very grateful that he was able to go on the trip. To the cowboys it was an adventure but to Luke it was a opportunity to open up a whole new world. And that awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host of intternational students and exchange visitors for many years."

Some details from the story to support what Luke thinks is, if you join Seagoing Cowboys you get to help coutries like Europe recover supplies that the people need to live. Also take care of many different kind so of animals and even get to site seeing when your done with your hard work or have free time. Some fun places that you might want to vist is Europe and China because they different kind of historial and beautiful sites. Before you can get to theses countries one thing you might want to consiter is the different dangers of the the sea. Details from paragraph 7 this sentence is when luke served as night watch man and he slid down the slippery ladder onto his backside. Luke had cracked his ribs and was out of work for a couple of days. Beside that is only thing you have to be worried about because if you think about the Seagoing Cowboys programs, you are making so many people happy because you are help them get back to lives. Your also changing and benefiting your life. Evidence from paragraph 1 is "",Luke Bomberger had no idea his life would change soon after high school.

In this paragraph will be talking about the young man on his way to eroup Luke Bomberger. Some people say that it was dangerous but I say he did a heroic act by bring cattle and horses to war torn countries. Now we think why he did that for so long, it wasent money, fame, or even for himself. No he did that selfless act for those people who had nothing left after war war 2. If you ask thats why he did it to help those women, men, and children, of china germany italy and all sorts of places that were left in ruins. In this paragraph will be talking about Luke's claims. Such as he knew it was an opprotunity of a life time. That is supported by parts of the story were he may have to work but has fun in between his hard work. Like when in italy he visits such places like Crete or the Acropolis. There were also bad times like when he fell of that slipery ladder and broke some of his ribs in a storm and almost fell over board if it wasent for a small metal bar holding him in. For a second lets talk about the time he spent overseas. We look at the fun he had in his nine adventures. Such as when he first visted Greece. He went to the Acropolis, soon after he visited the Panama Canal. Those were just some of the places that he got to travel not includeing Venice or Crete or even China. In the end all you can say about Luke Bombriger is that he tried to help people. He was so selfless that even broken ribs couldnt stop him form doing whats right. There are only words that can discribe his charachter, selfless, kind harted. The number one thing you can call him this and simply this human."

First of all,they can be anybody which i believe is just wrongIt should be somebody who wants to be in it and works hard to do so. Secondly,it makes zero sence what so ever that bigger states get more electoral votes because it's not fair to the other people in the state who want the other guy to win but that doesn't matter if it's the winner takes all syestem. Winner takes all system make no sence at all either. You shouldn't go by that if it's not what the people want. For example,in the year 2000 Gore won the popular vote or the vote the people wanted,and Bush lost. But since Bush won the electoral vote he became the president. So what you are trying to say is that the peoples vote doesn't count when choosing the person that will help run this country? That is terrible! Instead of going by how big the state is and how many electoral votes they get it shiuld be the popular vote or the peoples vote! Sincerely, Chris"

I have and of course it was unfair. first and foremost, votes come close to almost wins a lot. but in my opinion all wins are fair game. if u lose at something that big then its no one elses falt. you have to be a great leader and thrive hard enough. if not then u shouldnt be able to blame electoral college for it or even popularaity votes. to keep moving, both votes are supposed to be in your favor. so if u still lose from one or the other you probably just sucked. you have to actually try for president. you cant just expect to win because of elctoral college or popularity. you should plan on an even distribution. to wrap up, i believe that you can not base a win or lose in electoral college. you shouldnt depend on either but should be able to use both. if you blame your loss on the system then you suck."

When you are on board the ship you can find many things to do and many games to play. Sometimes after the animals were unloaded the would play baseball and volleyball. In On the ship there is many things tod o. Some people have to take night watch to stay up and watch the animals. During the day you have to feed and water the animals three times. If someone on that boat didn then those animals would be useless. Luke was a Seagoing Cowboy and he did a lo og these things i said. Luke took night watch to watch the animals, that noght after ruturning his report in he fell down stair towards an opening of the ocean, but he caught himeself. Luke broke ribs so he could not work for a while. Also when he broke his ribs he found to have fun on the boat and off the boat. They could play games in the animals pen when they got unloaded. Like I said they could play games like Volleyball and Baseball. Being a Seagoing Cowboy need s confidence and strngth, you oculd get picked to do any job but you dont know what it is. When your on the boat it is to late to go back becasue you are in the middle of the sea. Joining the Seagoing Cowboys is an oppertunity to have fun make friends and explore. You can also go see new counties and got o unique places. Some people can take that to heart. Sometimes goi ng to a different country is like seeing something that you loved the most that you havnt seen in a while. That place you visit could be where your family originated from. Joining the Seagoing Cowboys would be an amzing thin to do. Yes you would hae your ups and downs but you can always get back up. Just think if you join the Seagoing Cowboys you can do a lot of the things that you thought you could not do. That would be amazing.

Emotions are a strange thing, and not evryone is going undertsatnd you just based off of your looks. There is something called FACS (Facial Action Coding System) that classifies our six basic emotions which are happiness, suprise, anger, disqust,fear, and sadness. The computer constructs a 3-D model of the face and they rely on the muscles in the face to expose it all. All of this came from the relaization that no one knows exactly the expression on the painting ""The Mona Lisa""'s face. Some have observed the face so much, they can just tell how you're feeling. Like, in fact if someone close to me were feeling some type of way, I would be able to tell based off of their face expression unless it's ""just their face"". Not everyone is the same because ""most human contact and/or communication is nonverbal, icluding emotional communication"" which is stated from the text. Technology has helped alot though in this, especially researchers, psychologists and most likely scientists. In conclusion, The Mona Lisa painting face expression isn't unknown anylonger. A group of researchers, scientists and whoever else may it be got together to solve this mystery whether it be with a computer, or looking through books. And maybe through this I could pay more attention to face expressions since it's that easy."

If the driverless cars are responsive to crashes and quick breaking like they say the cars will be, then yeah i think the driverless cars are a great idea. The movie industry has been showing us these kind of things such as driverless cars for decades. In the movies you will see flying cars or even driverless cars, so to see Google cofounder Sergey Brin taking a pledge and trying to create such a thing is really incredible. If manufactured right and having the right electronics and gadgets on it, these driverless cars could take over the future when it come to driving or selecting a car. Back in the 1950's, General Motors created a car that could run on a test track but with an electrical cable that sent radio signals to a receiver on the front end of the vehicle. Engineers at Barkley done something like that but with magnets that will ""self"" drive the car around the track. The only problem with that is the amount of money it would costs to supply the roads with these magnets they are wanting to put in the roads to control these cars. Also having these sensors and so much technology in the car it would not take much for something to go wrong, have the sensors in the car fail and you lose the front end of your car and causes a tramatic accident. So it is just little things that like that can put such a big downfall on a project like this. Paragraph 9 talks about the laws that are directed to the regular gas, electrical and diesel vehicles, but what about the new driverless cars, won't you need new laws? Of course we will, that is one of the biggest things made in this case about the new cars, because new laws will need to be made in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. Even if the technology fails and someone is seriously injured, who is at fault? The coming of these new cars seem so close, but yet so far away because of all the technology and work that needs to be done to making something like this happen. People ask if it's a good idea, I say yes. I believe that these will make the roads safer and keep people more alert behind the wheel. As long as us humans don't rely 100% on the cars to take care of us we will be okay. But as soon as we start to let the cars do everything for us, that is when the tragic accidents start to happen and also when people start to sue these big name companies such as Google and Barkley. I say bring on the driverless cars as soon as possible and see what kind of change it does for our world."

At Venes the plant can get really hot there it can get over 800 deg, and Venes has some features that are close to Earth's surface such as valleys, mountains, and craters. The plant up in outerspace the plants go at its own speed, some go fast some go slow. But with Venes being the three plant from sun and we can be close or far away from the plant on the orbit. The bad things about Venes is that there is a 97% of carbon dioxide blankets it. The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater then out Earths. No Spaceship has touched the plant, cause of the matter. Only a spaceship has landed on the plant for three decades. The author in the story tells us alot about the plant Venes the air, the plant mase and so on.

This device would be used as an educatonal purpose as one of it's uses but it can be used for other thing's aswell. You can also use it during a surgery. For instance, if you were performing surgery on a person and he/ she decides to all of a sudden show sighns of pain through the device they can quickly give another dose of pain medicine and more gas to make the patient go back to sleep. Again there are many uses for this device and I agree that it should read student's emotional expressions because it would be benefitial and others would be of the understanding of one anothers feelings. This valuable information can also help students if one is feeling sad then a counselor can help. This may even save lives in the future, such as if someone is very suspicous the technology can read there emotional state and may even predict what they coulve done in the future to hurt somebody. This could even detect wther a person is on alchohol or under the influence of drugs. This new technology is down right phenominal and I hope this proceeds to be a succesful type of technology for the future of humanity."

Diverless cars were developing since 1980s, but until now, many manufacturers still can not create a best car that can be ""driverless"", which means human does not have anything to do with the wheel. Driverless cars are not needed for human because the systems are caused too expensive too many other details to do to create a perfect ""driverless car"", the human still needs to drive the wheel, and if technology failed by not following the traffic law, who will be responsible for that. First of all, to make a perfect autonomous car that does not need human to drive that will cause a lot of money and a lot of details to connect to the car. In the paragraph 3, the author said: ""The track was embedded with an electrical cable that sent radio signals to a receiver on the front end of the car."" and then, the author said: ""These smart-road systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expnesive to be practical."" And in paragraph 6, he said: ""Radar was a device on a hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars. It wasn't something you could buy at Radio Shack."" A perfect driverless car costs too much for systems and details. Second thing, It is called a ""driverless car"" but driver still has to drive the wheel. In the paragraph 2, the author wrote: ""They still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of griveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accident."" In paragraph 7, he said: ""This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation reqires."" And in paragraph 8, A BMW project manager driver said: ""'Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their trun to drive."" These showed that a driverless car is still needed a driver to drive the wheel, and of course human will get bored of it. And the most important issue, who will be responsible if technology failed. in pragraph 9, he said: ""If traffic laws change, new laus will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident."" He means by that if new laws come out, how will the autonomous car know and follow to law. And he said: ""If the technology fails and someone is injuried, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" And the auhtor said: ""...traffic laws are witten with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times."" ""Driverless car"" is not useful and needed for human.

Smart cars can be good on somthings but not on everything. I am against the development of these cars and Im going to tell you why. Smart cars, can help you not run in to things behind you. They can park for you, and they can turn on lights for you. In the artical it says "" the Google car simply announcess when the driver should be prepared to take over."" So let me ask you somthing. What if the driver fell asleep? The car is not going to know that right? The smart cars, are just going to give people a better chance of being on their phones at the same time. They wont be paying attention, next thing you know they crashed. If they don't make any of them and make people drive people well pay attention to the road. Its that simple. Last, cars should be made to be driven by people. Not so people can sit there and watch the car drive on its own. That is what you call lazy. Car lovers are not going to by those cars. Pople like to get the experence of driving a new fast car or a new rare car. Thats why people buy them, because if all the cars are cantrolled. Why would you buy a car that can go up to 200 mph if you can't manually drive it. Its a waste of money to be honest. In conclusion, I do not like the idea of driverless cars. They are pointless to people to buy. It worrens the purpose of saving money to buy a dream cars. Who ever thought of that need to think harder because he might not make that much money if thats what he want. I'd rather stick with an old honda civic."

If more car companies would form and release this idea of driverless cars that would be one less problem people would have to worry about, because everyone would save much more money than they usualy do, and people without cars wouldn't have to worry about getting places. Even though Google has already had cars that could drive by themselves they were not all the way driverless. Human would have to take over when the cars couldn't do what humans can. The law specificly says that cars are only safe when a human driver is at full control of the vehicle at all times. The law needs to lighten up and approve of driverless cars because it would help everyone all for the better. It will also make us more advanced by discovering new things with better technology. In a few years of so more and more states will have accepted the idea of autonomous cars, laws are going to be changed, and everything will work out just fine."
24,0,"The author belives thats Venus is a planet worth of studying. Althought it is very impossible to study this planet from the surface level. Venus has a surface temperature of 800 degrees fahrenheit,and the atomspheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. Venus has one of the most hottest surface temperature in the whole solar system. This could explain why it is so hard to have drones on the planets surface. Venusian geology and weather also present additional challenges like erupting valcanos, powerful earthquakes, and frequenrt lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface. Researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. This most likely caused by the sevear atmospheric temperature or the surface landscape. Reasearchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus. Nasa is working on making machanical computuer so our drones take more damage. Striving to meet the challenges presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on planet itself, but alson because human curiostity will likely lead us into many equllay intimidating endours. This show that Venus a diffacult planet to get information from, has value to be studied. It shows that our reasearcher have a challenge to take on hand. It also shows we can get new ideas on how to explore this planet. So in conclusion the planet of Venus is worth of the study."

""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" I chose this quote because, I believe that it's true because there is no way that any life form could exist on Mars. ""A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" I chose this quote because, that's pretty much what it is just some ordinary landform that just happens to look like a person. Even though the Face is just some oridinary rock formation people still think its an alien artifact and its not, because it wouldn't be possible to get your hands on even if you wanted to. ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" I chose this quote because, like I said before there isn't no such thing as a alien monument on Mars. The only reason why people think that the face is an alien artifact because that's what's NASA telling them. ""Some people think the Face is bonde fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" I chose this quote because it shows how desprete NASA really is, because they know it's just an ordinary landform but NASA wants people to think that so that NASA can get attention and money, and that is why I think that the Face is not an alien artifact after all."
22382,0,"Dear, state Senator Electoral College should be abolished because the electors may help ruin the president election and large states are not vistied or spoken to from the president other than small states. Sources from source 2: The Indefensible Electoral college: why even the best - laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumet. Reason 1 explains that many electors could ruin the president campaign and Reason 2 states many elector go for big states to cast in more votes other than small states. Many may not realize but when they vote they're not voting for the president, they're voting for state electors, for example ""each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee"" although each party chooses a trusted elector many can betray the party and select the other party. Also the betray can cost the presdient election dearly for instance Bradford stated "" back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. kennedy.(So that a popular vote for kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy)"". In other words the electors can ruin the president campaign and may cost most of the states problems. The electors want to cast in more votes from big states other than small states. Source 2 quoted "" Because of the -take- all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. Even though you would like to vote for your campaign the electors may not even visit other sates because they may think the other campaign has a better shot at getting more votes, but they do not know that maybe spoken words for the president may get more votes. also many may not even see any ad for the campaign, for example "" During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" The author explains that many electors don't even see most staes because they are small states and they may not get as much votes compared to larger states. Electoral College should be abolished because the electors may help ruin the president election and large states are not vistied or spoken to from the president other than small states. Electoral college may seem an unfair disadvantage for most voters many of their campaign that they want to win can be rather at a disadvantage or advantage depending on their electors, many electors may betray their campaign because they're not pubilicly held in office. Lastly the disadvantage is that many voters want to see what and how they are going to change or improve their well being, but most electors and campaigns do not visit the states that want view and know the candidates better. The electoral College should be abolished for the matter of the voter and the United States of America. In my opinion we should be allowed to vote on our own, for example instead of voting for an elector we should just vote on the type of campagin whose better and meet our daily bases needs."
8677,0,"This is my introduction to the essay i was assigned to do. I don't know if i'm against or not against using technology to read students emotional expressions, but what i do know is that if i did try to smile to make myself feel that emotion it wouldn't even work i tried before. If a computer was to read my emotional expressions right now it would read that im bored because of this stupid test i have to take and if you think i'm going to right a whole essay about this topic you're wrong. i will however answer the question slightly because if not my Istep person will get on me and tell me to take this serious which is never going to happen. I just have to waste my time in here for so long when i could be at home trying to get my school grades up but have to write a stupid essay about a topic i don't even care about. This next part is going to be about how this test doesn't benefit me in any way and if you were in this room, you wouldn't need a computer to read anybodys emotional expressions because you would be able to tell were all bored and nobody wants to take this test. I know that if you had to take this test you would be bored cause the topic i'm suppose to write about is boring amd i don't want to do it. If i were to take this test seriously what is it going to do for me nothing because why would i care if a person i don't know thought i was smart i wouldn't. The time that i've spent ranting about how i don't care about this whole test i could have been doing something productive at my house or school not caring about this. This next paragraph is my conclusion on whether i'm going to actually answer the question or not. The answer is no because it's stupid, i would rather be at home texting my girlfriend and spending time with my family, but im at school doing a essay wasting my time. So if i were at home i would probably be productive and trying to write a rap which i've been working on for a long time and i'm writing it on paper not typing it. It's going to be awesome i'm selling stuff to get the equipment and i hope this answersthe question properly about if i care if a computer can read a students emotional expression. I could rant about how i don't care about istep for forever but i'm not going to because I only have an hour and even if i had longer i still wouldn't spend the whole time doing this because i have better stuff i could be doing like texting my girlfriend and telling her how much i love her but i can't do that because i have to do this stupid Istep test. These required to do Istep test doesn't even show you how smart a student is how coulkd it by giving them five to six questions on a test, it doesn't make any sense and it doesn't benefit me in anyway so why would i spend my time doing this."
7240,0,"According to the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" Prof, Thomas Huang and Beckman institute, have made an invention""FACS"", that is able to tell someones expressions using technology. The author states the emotions of Mona Lisa's portriat by using the new technology. Do you ever think is the new invention even worth the pay or even necessary? Many people can be against it and many for it. Myself personally I am for Facial Action Coding System. The article states, you can tell someones emotions by just looking at them. It also states that we have trouble really describing the facial trait. By using FACS, we can get the actual facial traits in someones face. According to the author, ""'even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression' (like not smiling broadly)."" When using the Facial Action Coding System it recognizes the facial movements in a humans actual face even in paintings. Using the ""While Looking in the Mirror"" activity we followed the steps,but what if we were to add something that nobody knew except you. The person looking at you would think you are following the script. When you use that same exact script with the other facial you added, the technology would recognize it in an instant. The author also stated moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. In conclusion we all have our opinion, if using the FACS is good or not. The Facial Action Coding System is a technology Prof. Thomas Huang And Beckman institue invented to help people figure out what a painting is offering us in emotions or even what people themsleves are offering. Either wanting to use technology or our own brains, the only person who really knows is the person who painted the painting and the person giving the facial expression."

Many people wish to do this, but they may never be able to be a part of this program, so that is why he would tell you to participate in this program. Another reason Luke would try to convince you to join is because you could be helping people and countries by taking care of animals, such as horses, young cows, and mules. Luke would also tell people to join the Seagoing Cowboys because you could visit new places you have never been to before, like Europe or China, or Greece and Italy. Luke had the chance of visiting these four places because he was part of the Seagoing Cowboys, and you get to cross oceans, like the Atlantic and Pacific. Another reason luke would tell you to join the program would be because you would always be busy. The animals all needed food and water two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats ave to be pulled up from the lower level. And their stalls have to be cleaned. Luke would also tell you to be careful if you joined the Seagoing Cowboys. On Luke's second trip, he almost fell into the dark waters of the Atlantic. He served as a watchman, and he would have to check on the animals every hour. And one rainy night, when he was going to report to the captain, he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. His heart raced as he shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. But luckily, a small strip of metal along the edge stopped him from sliding towrad the the dark Atlantic, and kept him aboard the ship. Luke was happ he was alive, but he had to take a couple of days off of work because he cracked his ribs. But you can also have fun on the ship, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. They would play baseball or volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals had been. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped time go by faster. Being part of a Seagoing Cowboy can be a great expierience, and it was for Luke Bombergur. It opened the world to him. He said he was grateful for the opportunity of being part of the program. It made him more aware of people of other countries and their needs. And that awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years. That's why you should be part of the Seagoing Cowboys. It will give you great memories that will stay with you. It will give you life expierience that you might need later on in your life. It will give chances to visit new places you might love and never forget about. It will give you a chance of helping people and countries around the world. It will give you a chance to meet new people and to get to know them well. It will give you all of this and much, much more. That is why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Once you decline it, you will regret you did. Once you accept it, you will be happy you entered this program."

In today society cars are our only transporatation, well in the U.S. it is. many different places around the world are beginning to use other ways to get around from place to place. This are some reasons why cars should be limited usaged because you can save more money, you save more time, and you become more happier and less tense and stress. To begin with, In paris people are to save more money not having cars because of smog. Smog fine citizens for even or odd numbers on their license plates. A quote from the passage states ""the goal is to promote alternative transporation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines."" This quote shows how citizens really feel about cars, they want more transportation outlets and to ban cars so they can save more money. Next, Picture being stuck in traffic late to work only becuase it was probaly a car accident or maybe the road is getting constructed. A good way to avioding traffic is to use other source of transporation. It saves you more money and less time. This also improve the safety of the people beaucse fewer accident can be avioded. Most accidents happen becuase of rushing to get to work or school. for exable from the passge states"" he proposed partnering with the telecommunication industry to create cities in which ""pedestrian"", bicycle, privatecars... are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resouces, lower emissions and improve safety."" I agree with this quote because it gives you reason to imporve the way me save our money and hepls make our environment safe. Last, Study show that more people who don't have car are more happy then people who have cars. the reason that is, is because people who dont have cars don""t have to worrie about car insurance and car payments. People who dont drive become less tense and stress. A quote from the passage states "" when i had a cae i was always tense. I'm much happier this way, "" said heidrun walter, a media tainer and mother of two"
18324,0,"I think that people should participate in the seagoing Cowboys program because it makes people more aware of people and there needs. It helps you think of other people instead of just yourself and being selfish. It's a very good job for people because they help people and animals that are lost or hurt and they go sightseeing. They go on many adventures during the job. Here are some of the places they went while sightseeing. They went to Europe and China they saw the Acropolis in Greece which was special to them.They also took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy a city with streets of water. Lastly they toured a excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on the way to China. Those are a lot of places that they have traveled to. Those sound like awesome places to visit. Whenever they were bored on the boat they would play games like baseball and volleyball. They also play table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling and games that just helped pass time. They would also have the best time unloading the animals that they got which was there favorite thing to do. It is probably a good job because in the beginning of the story Luke talked about how it was an opportunity of a lifetime to have that job which means it must be a special job. He also said at the end of the story that he experienced new adventures like all the things he did so if you like adventures then that's a good job for you. That is why I think people should have this job it sounds like a pretty good job for everyone. It opens up the world to people and lead his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years. Sometimes the job isn't that good like the time Luke fell of the boat and cracked his rib but now he is better. The job will help people and I think that the job would make the world a better place by everyone helping people and caring for the animals. That is why people should get this job to help the world."
8043,0,"The use of a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because the teachers can recoginze what is happening to the students or what they need. it will also be helpful for the students when they don't dare to ask or somthing that they can't explain. The matchine are exact and they are able to detect exactly how other people are feeling even when they are trying to hide their emotions. This new technology is the latest innovation from Prof. Eckman, creator of FACS has classified six basic emations. They are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. All of the emotions associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit"". The software read people's face and tell what is happening to them. Dr. Huang observes that,""The facial expressions for each emotions are universal"". For example, our frontalis pars lateralis muscle raises our eyebrows when we are surprised. Using a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Imagine a computer knows when we are happy or sad. Dr. Huang predicts that it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructors. sometimes, it is hard for the teachers to guess the students. Human may know 50% of what they need acording to face emtions but the Face Action Coding System might know about 90% of human,s emotions by scanning their faces. Therefore, the use of the latest software is good to express the emotions of students in a classroom is very valuable because it saves time and also can offer the students what they really want. Whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions."
21008,0,"Everyone has their opinion about the Electoral College, but does everyone look into it and get all the information they need about it before jumping to conclusions? Truth is, there are some who just assume they know everything about the Electoral College to make a decision. Then there are those who do research and look into the facts. Under the electoral college system, voters don't even vote for the president they actually vote for a slate of electors that elected that president. In source 2, it states that the single best arguement against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The statement is that American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system we have now is said to allow for something much worse than that. Although many people despise the Electoral College, there are also some good reasons to keep this method of choosing the President stated in Source 3. Some of the reasons are certainty of outcome, no trans-regional appeal, and avoiding run-off elections. These are just three reasons despite its lack of democratic pedigree; all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons. The Electoral College is looked at as a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The most worrying thing that could possibly happen is a tie in the electoral votes. If this was to occur, the election would be taken over by the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the President."

Plus they talk about in paragraph 3 sentence 1 is there is a 97% thick carbon dioxide. The conditions are very extream, more than anyone has expected.

8519,0,"A coding system that can identify facial expressions of a person, how crazy. Prof. Thomas Huang of the University of Illinois and Prof. Nicu Sebe have created a coding system that can not only identify human emotions put on a painting. Using this technology in the classroom would be valuable to not only the student but the teachers the classroom. Using this coding system would be helpful to the students. For example, in paragraph six, it states, the system could tell if a student was getting confused or bored in class, then it could modify the lesson. Using this method could get students more involved in the lesson by making it easier to understand or making it more fun. Making it easier to understand could help the students learn the material faster and could possibly increase the students grade in the class. Making it more fun could get the students more involved in the lesson by asking questions about the lesson. This technology could also help the teachers. In paragraph six it states that the technology can modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. Using this system could help a teaher with their students because they cannot pick out the exact muscle movements of certain emotions the coding system can. For example, in paragraph three it states the operation and process of the sytem. First, it constructs a 3-D computer model of the face, then it observes the fourty four major muscles in the of the face of the model. When it is looking at the model it is looking for an action movent. An action movement is one or more muscles moving. Different combinations of the different muscles in the face create different emotions such as happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. How this would help the teacher is it could look at more faces faster than the teacher and it could pick out the slightest emotional change in a student. Then the system could modify the lesson to keep the students interested in it. Finally it would help the classroom. In paragraph nine it states that empathy or the feeling someone else's emotional state. may happen because we unconsiously imitate another person's emotions. This could effect the classroom. For example, if one student is sad their friends would try to comfort them and the might become sad too. Is a student begins to laugh they might cause other students to laugh. Having this coding system in a classroom could alert a teacher if a student is sad, so they can handle it so other students don't get upset. This could help keep the atmosphere of the classroom positive so learning can be done effeciantly. Using this technology in the classroom would be valuable. From modifing the leeson to make it easier for the students to understand and helping the teacher keep their students interested in the lesson to keeping the atmosphere of the classroom positve this coding system would be valuable in the classroom."

Second, the Electoral College may be swayed by bias. Third, citizens do not really have control over their vote. The Electoral College system should be changed. Many American citizens do not agree with the voting system. Citizens have grievances about the system being unfair and unreasonable. The Office of the Federal Register states, ""It's official: The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality"" (source 1). If American citizens are persistant with the issue, and continue to argue, then why is the government keeping the system? Why doesn't the government come up with a more rational voting system? The Electoral College's vote may be swayed by bias. How can we trust total strangers with our vote? Bradford Plumer states, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner take all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in the states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states (source 2). Voters do not get the full effect of voting because they are voting for other ""qualified"" people to vote for them. How is that possibly effective? Citizens do not have control over their vote. Once citizens vote their vote is out of their hands. The Electoral College chooses the president for them and there is nothing citizens can do about it. Bradford Plumer states, ""Your states certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the congress and the national archives as part of the official records of the presidential election"" (source 2). The government has full control over how the election goes, not the citizens who voted. The entire Electoral College system is completely irrational. The government needs to come up with a new way to vote for future presidents that is more fair. If we find a solution to this problem the government will not only gain favor of the American citizens, but also keep the balance that is established by the constitution. The American citizens will have control over their vote. The Electoral College should be abolished."

So without further adue...."" He takes a remote like thing and turns on the projector, showing an image on the wall. As I look around the room from my corner, I see a number of expressions, some confused, some amused, some even a bit worried. But one expression stands out. A new guy, I'd say he's been here for about a few weeks, is two seats next to me, mumbling something under his breath. I give him a strange look. He seems frightened.

24673,0,"The Electoral College was a compromise made by our founding fathers. It was made as a compromise between the election of a president through a vote from Congress and election through popular vote. The downside to this way of election is that the voters are not voting for one of the candidates but for their state electors, who then vote for the president. The votes from each of the states electors then count as votes for the candidate. This way of election for a president is unfair and confusing and should be changed. First off, the Electoral College is unfair in the way that a vote from an individual does not really count because the only votes that really count are the ones from the Electoral College. It is also unfair that the voters cannot always choose who they want thier electors to be. There are also voters who have no hope just because of the state they live in, such as Democrars in Texas or Republicans in California. Since they know that thier vote doesnt matter in a state whose majority of the population goes fot the opposing party. Thsi is one reason why individual votes are more reasonable and fair. Secondly, the Electoral College is very confusing for a voter who doesnt know how it works."
6403,0,Making a claim against reading students emotions. In my opinion could be a bad idea. That might be taking technology a little too far. They caculated what the painter painted Mona Lisa feelings would've have been. Thats insane and just a little too far. If they can read a paintings expressions from several years ago. I wouldn't want them reading a humans facial expression. Thats my thoughts on that. It says they can caculate humans expression like math hoemwork in paragraph 2. It begins with a computer that constructs 3-D computer model of the face. All 44 muscles of the human face must move like human muscles. Each humans facial expression is universal according to the statement in paragraph 4. It's pretty amazing to think about then again it's kind've scary humans can do that reading. I perform the same expressions every day well every one does it isn't just me. It isn't very valuable in my opinion either because maybe if their emotional problems are different then they need to be what are they going to do about it. It will just read his facial expressions won't change anything. That would also cost a lot of money to have in each certain classrooms and also a bunch of money to make the 3-D computer. In paragraph 6 it says if your frowning and a ad pops up it can read that and if you smile a certain ad would pop up. Just crazy to think about. It says in paragrpah 7 your home Pc couldn't handle reading that of course and they are expensive enough. So that would be much more costly even.

In the text the author says, ""Venus can be our nearest option for a planetary vist, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel."" This supports that veus is worth studying because it's close to earth. Also it would take les time to get there then the rest of the planets. Thats another reason that why we should study venus. Lastley another reason we should study venus is it could of supported viarios forms of life. In the text the author says, ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have suported various forms of life, just like earth.""

17622,0,"Is it possible that the face on Mars could have been created by aliens? Some people believe that the Face on Mars was formed by aliens; however, I do not believe that is possible. A few of the pictures taken of the Face on Mars were taken when it was cloudy,but that is the only information that suggests that aliens could have made the face. Many scientists have done extensive research on the Face on Mars, and they have found that it is nothing more than a natural landform in the shape of a face. If you believe aliens formed the face on Mars, then be prepared for multiple facts that go against that belief. Numerous scientists have studied the area in which the surreal face formation is located, and they have found various mesas. Martian mesas are common around Cydonia, the place in which you would find the face. Because of these facts, it is believed that the Face on Mars is just another Martian mesa that is coincidently shaped like a face. NASA even captioned one of the pictures saying ""Huge rock formation that was formed by shadows, giving the illusion of a face."" This explanation makes a tremendous amount of sense more than aliens creating the face. Although quite a few people vehemetley express their opinions that the face is evidence of life on Mars, NASA says that they are not hiding any information about alien life. Why would NASA keep life on Mars a secret? If life was found on Mars, NASA would share the information because they would make a lot of money from it. They would make history if they had proof of life in Mars! Some defenders of NASA even wish that there was an ancient civilization on Mars. There is absolutely no way that NASA would turn down that amazing oppurtunity and keep the evidence to themselves. The picture taken by Michael Malin is another reason to believe that the face was not an alien creation. He took a picture that was ten times sharper than the original Viking photos by using his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC). The picture taken on April 5, 1998, revealed that the Face on Mars is a natural landform. There was no reason to believe that the face was not natural, but some people still believed that aliensdid in fact make the formation. The tenacious scientists were still determined to find evidence to make everyone see the truth. April 8, 2001, was a cloudless day in Cydonia, and Mars Global Surveyor was able to get close enough to the face to capture a extraordinary photo. The picture was taken using the camera's maximum resolution. If there were objects in the picture near the face, you could have seen what the objects were. There was nothing unusual aroung the Face on Mars. The picture shows a Martion equivalent to landforms common around the American West. It reminds some people of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, which is the same height as the Face on Mars. This evidence supports the idea that the giant, face-shaped formation is a natural landform, nothing more, nothing less. Aliens are not even proved to exist, let alone form a landform like this one."

That is why driverless cars are the best option to keep progressing out technology today. Energy consuption is a big problem in our time's right? In the text it says the cars Google founder Sergey Brin foresee's, use half of the fuel that today's taxis use. They would also have more felxibilty than a bus. Not only will this save energy and money, it will help everyday citezens with transportation. Nevertheless, there are some few problems to this innovation. In the text it talks about waiting for the law to change traffic laws. What if the technolgy fails and someone is injured? Will the driver or the manufator be sued? Well this problem has many solutions and ther is no need to hesitate to find one. The solution could range from some special driverless car insurance, to the manufactor to pay all the cost since it techincally is his fault. In conclusion, driverlees cars are definetly the future, why are we hesitating? Is it because they are some small legal problems that can not be fixed? We have solved much more complex problems ranging from solving a Rubik's cube to big political ones. This is our future and we should pursue it."
18501,0,"In the future your grandkids and great grandkids will not have drive cars because they will most likely drive themselves. They won't have to learn to get there permits or pass driving school to get there liscenses the cars drive themselves and, will have no need for a human to control the steering wheel, and the skill of learning how drive and understanding what freedom comes with being able to drive will be lost. Cars that can drive themselves are a very bright idea, but they take away a the freedom that comes with getting your liscences, and learning the ablitily of driving. Having cars that drive without humans can mean more accidients if the cars can not account for traffic jams, other accidents, roadwork, and a work or school zone. How will these cars know when people are crossing the road or know how fast the speed limit is for that area. Learing how to drive is an important skill for teenagers and young adults to learn, because they don't just learn how to drive they also learn responiblity to pay for the gas and insurance bills. They start learing to take care of themselves so when they get in to the real world they don't have to rely on their parents to keep paying for everything they need. What will these cars be powered by? Will they be powered by a gas engine, a diesel engine, battery powered, or a gas eninge and a battery powered engine combination. What would the price to buy one these cars be, would it be low enough where the average employee can afford to buy it or will it only be were only the richer people can afford to buy them. Are these cars going to be allowed by every state and what laws would be inplaced for these cars incase of an accidient were to happen on the highway. Therefore, These cars are a good idea but shouldn't be used because they take away learning responsibilty and everyone needs to learn that skill so they can surive in the real world after they graduate from either highschool or college. We don't even know if these cars would be afordable for the average female or male employee, or where you could buy these cars at."
10403,0,"To me I think there should and should'nt be a thing called ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"". Why? I say there should be because there would be less accidents here and there. There would be less people dying in the world due to a car accident. Also because people would be able to go to many places with having troubles finding their location they want to go to. Then getting home late at night would be much safer. Instead of having to drive home when your really tired or you've consumed some kind of alcohol beverage. You would get home safer and not have your life at risk nor anyone else's life on risk. To me, I say their should be this driverless cars. On the other hand, it isn't the brightest idea either. One cause what if they don't know how to work this car or it breaks down in the middle of no where and you don't have the fuel you need to supply your car with. What if the car stops working and your in the middle of no where and don't have anything to fix the car with. It would be fill with all this technology parts that the driver might not know anything about. It would all be new to the driver who is driving this new car that has been invented. In my opinion it isn't the best idea nor the worst. We all had to have know that new technology was coming. New things were going to be produced and what not. But at the same time they should think of the people who don't have any idea about this production that is being made."
13597,0,"If I'm imaging myself to be a scientist at NASA dicussing the FACE with someone who thinks it was created by aliens because why would the moon have faces on it and plus humans can't be out in outter space without an space suit beacuse they can die within seconds. And if I have some scientist partners that trust me and believe what I'm saying because anything or anyone could of done this for fun.. It just takes time to figure out whats going on, on the moon. And figure out that something has to doing this and make it look like us people/scientist at NASA look crazy. By saying that there's a FACE on the moon. Who wants to believe that soemone has made a FACE on the moon by these past years. But I know we people/scientist of NASA will figure out what it might be causing these marks/ FACE's on the moon. And no one can say anything about whats happening beacuse they don't know the truth and how do we know or donn't know that if someone is trying to make us look stupid and make it look like something or someone has been on that moon marking it? One of the things is that I'm still kinda confused on is how or what could of done this and why? Why would somebody or something do this to our moon? And if they did it to our moon to just mess around and make fun of us for thinking that it was something real or ""ALIENS"" that I don't believe in for some reason. But i just don't think it could be aliens beacuse they are not real. Plus I've seen a real and real evidence from the internet or anywhere else and there's no proof. And another reason why I think that it couldn't be anything alive is that they couldn't survive a ""second"" out in space. And maybe it could've been the moon itself. What I mean by that is that the moon can just form it itself and created just a peron FACE or just have been something else that no one could or would ever identify. Even if they try so hard to do. It still wouldn't work. Maybe it's just how the landform just creates in space. Like maybe the other plantes have something in coomon and do the same thing but no one could ever notice."
21027,0,"Cars are great, you can get from one point to another in a short amount of time, but are they really necesary? After all we have public transportation, bicicles, and our own two feet. The advantages of car usage can be picked up by other forms of transportation, and the environment can be saved at the same time. If car usage was limited the world and its people would be much better off. There would be less pollution, a drop in the number of people diagnosed with diabeties, less accidents, and over all a healthier planet and world population. There would be less pollution because if car usage was limited then there would be less pollutants from the gas in cars going up into the air. Source 2 provides evidence of this, from ""...days of near-record pollution, Paris enforcesd a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.""(Duffer 10) to ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday."" Additionally many people are content with not having a vehicle, or even a licence in some cases, as shown in Source 1, 3, and 4. In Source 1 Heidrun Walter explains her view on not having a car after previously owning one, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Carlos Arturo Plaza in Source 3, shows his support inlimited car usage by saying how it helps the environment and the health of the people in reducing stress, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" In Source 4 Elisabeth Rosenthal speaks of how her own children and Mr. Sivak's son, all avoid using cars and Rosenthal's children don't even have licenses and they are 19 and 21 years old. The health of the people in our world would improve and there would be less people diagnosed with diabetes because they would likely get more exercise. With limited car usage people would have to find other ways of transportation, which includes bike riding, skating, hiking, or public transportation. While using public transportation would not help to improve the health of the people, biking, skating, and hiking would, as some people do these things just for excercise. So if people were forced to do one of these alternative forms of transportation, they would be excercising and getting from point A to point B all in one shot. Not only would limited car usage help peoples health by making them be more active, but it would also help by providing cleaner air. Poluted air can cause health problems, especially in the lungs, if car usage was limited, then polution would go down, so people would be breathing fresher air that would cause less lung damage. There would be less accidents because there would be less cars on the road. The majority of the vehicles on the road would likely be public transportation too, so the drivers may be more cautious than the average driver since they have the lives of many people in their hands. The world would be a safer and healthier place is car usage was limited."
22171,0,"How you ever been in a traffic jam? Where you find yourself late for work and overly stressed and tensed. This leads many people in thinking of a life without cars, of a place where loud honking and angry people aren't the norm. Well in places like Vauban, Germany peole have decide to smear the lines of the ideal suburban community by banning cars in the district. The term ""car free"" zone never got more realistic then the streets of Vauban, where more than 70 percent of people have given up the tradition of owning a car. According to ""In German suburbs, life goes on without cars"" many people see this new way of life extermly effective. ""When I had a car I was always tensed"", states Heidrun Walters. Heidrun is a local from Vauban who found herself happier walking around then being behind a vehicle. Residents in Vauban believe that bicycling and walking are more effective for themselves and the enviroment. This leaves the question on how cars are able to be used in a district like Vauban; where ther are no garages, street parking, or driveways. Even though there are few car owners in the district you can buy a car space for 40,000. Although Vauban bans cars for the sheer annoyance ot them, other places like Paris have a more enviromental issue with cars. In Paris, the amount of smog has became so outrages officials have given ciztens in the parisian streets a temporary ban to help clear the air of pollution. Many drivers felt that this ban was unfair and discouraging, so up to 4,000 ciztens were fined for using there car. Since Ftrance is a Diesel fuel community, researchs are blaming the diesel for the smog problems. Even though the difference for the use of diesel more than gas can be the problem, who to say that the smog will stay gone? Some countries have taken to this new trend of no cars and make a day out of it. Such as Bogata, Colombia has speard the idea throughout South America- causing milions to travel by walking and using bicycles. The main idea of this program is to promote alternate transportation and reduce fog, says the article ""Car free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogato"". The turnout for this day was so large two other Colombian cities joined in. ""It's a good opptunity to take away stress and lower pollution"", said local businessman Carlos Arturo who joined and rode a two seated bicycle with his wife. The ethusiastic outcome made on lookers from other countries stare with awe. America, who's ciztens are known for driving expensive cars has begun to broaden it's fews on the ideal Utopia. According to ""The End of Car Culture"", many Americans have been buying less and less cars as the years progress. Some of this new rrefinery stems from the recession, when many people couldn't afford a brand new car. Sociologist believe America is taking a permnant shift in it's cultural stand point. Along with pop cultures help, reseachers believe that it allows people to be more connected without driving to meeting their friends. This only futher shows that the worlds outlook on life has opened to new and intresting ways. Whether it's giving up cars all together, or having a national day dedicated. People all around the world have began to look at new and improved way of living. Some countries are even becoming inspired by others who have found that a more car conservative life can be better, and places like Paris have seen that without cars their enviroment could be a lot more cleaner and effective."
8223,0,"Many students take their own charge in school, but that often means they hide important information from others; for instance, when they are not sure about something or when they are tired and find it hard to focus. These types of situations are hard for schools to deal with. However, there is some technology that could help. Made by Dr. Paul Eckman, the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) uses major muscles in the face to calculate a person's emotions. This technology has been used in many places, but one of the big places it could be used is the classroom. As long as it is used right, the Facial Action Coding System could greatly improve student interest, focus, and clear up confusion in different lessons. The uses start with student interest. School often is not the most exciting place in the world, especially in higher grades. The biggest argument for this is that ""they don't need interest in what they learn, they are adults."" However, that is not completely true. Anyone can become uninterested in something, and it can impact how much effort they put into it. That's where the FACS comes in. It could recognize when a student is uninterested in something and find some way to fix that. Ways to make something interesting vary by student, so building a plan and relationship with the student is an important part to making it work properly. Some people will likely say that doing this is way more work than it should be for something so small, but they do not realize how big that actually is. Everything a student learns is going to impact their lives in some way, and it's a school's job to make sure this sticks with the student. If it does not, who knows what will happen. Make sure to remember that uninterest isn't the only way a student can lose what they are supposed to get from school. With students having to wake up early and do homework almost every day, it can be hard to get the right amount of sleep. This can possibly lead to a lack of focus if what the student is learning in school is not engaging enough. Many people could call this a lack of focus. Losing focus in the middle of a class often leads to forgetting almost all the information from the class that day. If we could detect drowsiness in class, the information could be used to try and talk to the child about a better sleep schedule. If communication with the child on this front wouldn't be possible, the teacher could try and find some way to increase interactivity in such a way that increases focus for most students in the classroom. One common argument I've seen against this is that it is an unnecessarily annoying affair, but there's nothing really backing this up. As long as it is implemented correctly, any major annoyance can be avoided. Both of these first two reasons had a lot to do with the student personally, but sometimes it has more to do with the lesson and how understandable it is. Confusion is a strange mix of anger and sadness when a fact or solution cannot be understood properly, or a different fact or solution was understood before and a new fact or solution is taking its place now. It is a common emotion in schools, and could be avoided easily with the FACS. When the FACS detects that a student is confused, the content is broken down for the student in a way that is easier to understand. The content can be delivered at the student's own pace, in an attempt to keep the student from getting even more lost. A system similar to this could save many students from getting bad grades. Now someone is probably saying ""Why can't the students ask about the problem when they get confused,"" and this is a very good point. However, it is also an easy point to shoot down. Many students find the prospect of asking questions scary, especially with the idea of a ""bad question"" or ""stupid question"" and personal embarassment. With this idea in place, they wouldn't have to ask publically or get shamed by the teacher for not understanding the subject. Instead, the entire proccess could be private. It would eliminate confusion in many subjects. And so, with the elimination of confusion in the classroom, the increase of focus during lessons, and the implementation of systems to increase student interest, the FACS could be a lifesaver for many students in school. However, with the cost of implementing such a system likely being outrageous, the chance of this being implemented is low. Nevertheless, we can always try."
5935,0,"New software called the Facial Action Coding System could give us more information to better our experience both at home and in classrooms. It could also give us more information about art pieces so that we may better understand it, such in the case of Leonard da Vinci's most well known pieces, the Mona Lisa. The Facial Action Coding System shows us that the woman in the Mona Lisa is ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry (D'Alto 1),"" which gives us much more information about the feeling behind a painting, and this software could also be applied to the daily lifestyle most people live through by giving more information about how they feel and making necessary adjustments. At home, people could use this software to better their internet use by providing more information to let companies know which ads you like, for example, ""if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different (D'Alto 6)."" But aside from using the software at home to make using the Web more comfortable, people, especially teachers, may find use in the software as a means to let them know how students feel in the classrooms and which lessons do particularly well. If ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored (D'Alto 6),"" then the teacher could change the lesson next session or help a certain student who is having trouble understanding the material. The Facial Action Coding System can also allow for new opportunities for teachers to create an online lesson and recieve emotional feedback from students that they may not have otherwise gotten, as ""most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication (D'Alto 6)."" The software developed to read human emotions is certainly impressive as it can read emotions or even be programmed to do something when a certain emotion is read, and it does so by analyzing the 44 muscles in a human face. The Facial Action Coding System works, as stated in the last paragraph, by constructing a three dimensional model of a face, in which ""all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles (D'Alto 3)."" When one or more muscles move, it is ""called an action unit (D'Alto 3),"" which is read by the software and compared to a neutral face to calculate the probable emotion behind a face, whether it be ""a real face or in the painted face of the Mona Lisa (D'Alto 4)."" This works because humans almost always show the same muscle movements when conveying an emotion, even if some people show weaker degrees of expression (D'Alto 4). Humans can already preform an interpretation of an emotion by another, but with the Facial Action Coding System, society could better understand and feel empathy for each other. Though some may say that this invades our privacy, or that it would have no use in a classroom due to some individuals preforming poorly, these claims are weak. Though the Facial Action Coding System does require a camera, it is, at the end of the day, software that one can choose wether or not to download and use the software, and, though they may be sending more information to companies, it is only sending feelings about a certain product from software that still requires feedback on how well it works, and since it is software, it exists as an option just like the other software one can find on the Internet. While in a classroom, some students may be preforming badly though they find the lesson enjoyable, the teacher could always approach them himself and provide assistance, which would make school a better place as people understood what they were learning much more than if they were not using the software in classroom computers. Overall, the Facial Action Coding System provides more opportunities and choices than it diminishes, which are next to none. The Facial Action Coding System is valuble to the classroom not only as an effective tool to help teachers understand and connect with students more or make the lessons much easier to understand, but also as a way to help better the standard of living as communication between each other would be better as the software continues to develop and make information regarding faces more simple to understand."

21599,0,"There are many advantages to limiting car usage. These examples include, less stress, cleaner air, and more safety. There is less stress because you are always tense as stated in the first source. There's cleaner air because cars are one of the leading causes to air pollution as said in source two. There's also more safety because streets don't have as much traffic stated on source three and four. One benefit of limiting car usage is that there is less stress. There is less stress because when you own a car you may find yourself tense a lot of the time or maybe all of the time. In source one, Hedrium Walter stated that she was always tense with a car and now she is much happier. Bike riding and walking outside can be relieving without the sound of motors, hearing the children play in the park and breathing the fresh air is much better. In source three Carlos Arturo Plaza said that car free day is a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution. This is another instance of someone supporting limiting car usage because there is less stress. Cleaner air is another benefit to limiting car usage. Cars are one of the leading factors to air pollution, this is shown in source two. In source two, it states that congestion was down sixty percent in the capital of France afer five-days of intenstifying smog. This proves that limiting car usage provides cleaner air for the enviroment. With cleaner air, there is a healthier poulation which is a benefit to limiting the usage of vehicles. There is more safety with limiting car usage. If car usage is limited, then there aren't as many car accidents and there is less traffic. Less traffic could also lead to public transportation becoming more efficient and faster. The bus would be able to get to places much faster without other cars being in the way wich would be a benefit to limiting car usage. Limiting car usage would be for the better of the population. It would cause less stress, cleaner air, and more safety. The usage of cars should be limited for the better of man and it should happen everywhere."

I really like the idea of that i want you to keep using this process. Each candidate thats running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. You help choose your state's electors when you vote for president. Most states have a ""winner-take-all"". Maine and Nebraska have a variation of ""proportional representation"" The popular vote doesnt work because when they did it they had one the popular vote but lost the presidency. The popular vote winner could again lose the presidency but the electoral college still has is defenders. The popular vote can let peopel pick who they want but the electoral college chooses people for you to select from that they know and have a feeling would do a good job and be a good president. People can vote all over the world not knowing what that person is thinking about doing to this world. For all we know he or she could be thinking about destroying us and making a whole knew other part of a different world.

19016,0,"Who is at fault when the technology fails and someone is injured? When there are positive aspects and negative aspects of dirverless cars, one should think about who will take responsibilities. Driving driverless cars could be seen as advantage to some but could also be seen as disadvantage for some. I believe that driving driverless car is more dangerous than today's car. The cars could have postive aspects such as the speed and the fuels uses. The cars could have negative aspects too. In paragraph 7, the article stated that the GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vihicle is in danger of backing into an object. If we can make an example, people could have not notice the vibrate if they don't sit at the dirver seat.They could be resting at the back of the car while the car is driving it self. On the same paragraph, it also said that Manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road. I think installing cameras inside someone's car is unneccessary because everyone has privacy that they want to protect. Driving driverless could be advantage for many people. The cars would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus. That is something that would be able to change the world. The car can handle dirivng functions at speeds up to 25 mph. Sensors being advanced could be advantage to this driverless car. The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power fromt he engine. That could help the human driver to control when they are managing it alone. Driving driverless could be dangerous as the founder of the Google Car project stated. The car would not need driver but drivers still need to control it. Now, that is not something that could be called as driverless car. Paragraph 7 stated ""special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" The car can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to alert the driver when the road ahead requires human skills. Then, this means the people who drive must remain aleart all the time. This had lead to questions on people's safety. Ultimately, there could be postiive and negative aspects of driverless cars. Many people may have felt more relief because they do not have to worry about speeding up more than they used to. In other way, there may be people who opposed to this idea. They may felt like there are more dangers in it. I believe that safety is a big concern when it comes to driving. The questions that is still lingering is that who will take responsibiites when accident happens."

Although some people may see this as a impossible way of living some of us do not. To begin, people can live without cars people have done it before us and eventually people will do it after us. As shown in source 1 these people in Vauban, Germany have given up a life of cars for a simpler much quiter life in the suburbs. Life in this city has been condensed down into a one square mile area where people are able to go on with there everyday lives without having to get into a car to go somewhere. Life in this city is does not go completely without cars if these people need to leave the city they can simply walk to their very own parking space in the parking garage right on the outskirts of the city. these people have the ability to keep there cars but they have to buy a parking space when they buy there house you also generally wouldnt need your car unless you were going on a long drive that required you to leave the city. There is also the fact that there will be a day soon when we run oout of fossil fuels and what is a fossil fuel? gas. there will soon enough be a day where we dont have any gas and we will not be able to drive cars everywhere that we want. Next, this would be one of the most effective ways to cut back on pollution. as shown in the 2nd source paris was struggling with a very bad polution problem that they needed to deal with. Paris was having the same sort of problem that beijing, china is having and beijing is the most poluted city in the world. so they banned all the cars that ended in a even number on monday and a odd number on tuesday. Just doing this for one day cut the amount of pollution in half. Imagine our worldwide polllution levels if driving was limited. The second largest form of pollution is cars so limmiting driving could even drop cars a few ranks back. Every part of getting to fossil fuels that fuel our cars is more and more pollution. gas is a very large pollutant and it causes alot of problems for our nation and one day there will be no more gas. Furthermore, limiting driving would almost be cheaper for the people as talked about in source 4 less and less people have been getting there liscenses and driving cars because it isnt needed as much anymore. there are more ways of public transit that people are taking advantage of such as the mans son who takes the Bay Area Rapid Transit instead of driving his car. some might say that taking these other forms of transportation might take longer and yes they might be right but they are also much cheeper instead of having to pay a large amount of money to first, buy a car and then, buy gas. which the gas prices only seem to be going up lately. They have the ability to buy cheep tickets for the ride on the train or maybe a bus. As i spoke about earlier we will one day run out of fossil fuels. Gas is a fossil fuel and leading up to the time where we wont have gas anymore the gas will just keep getting more and more expensive because the less gas we have in our community the more that it will cost. also the more that people will want it one day most of us will not have the money to drive cars not because of the cost of the car but because of the cost of the gas. Coming to a end, there are many other ways to travel other than buy a vehichle and some may be easier for you cheeper for you or better for the environment so why keep on hurting the environment when you could simply make the world a better place by just not driving a car. there are many reasons to limit driving but we could easily do it because people can live without cars, it would help the environment and cut back on pollution, it would also be much cheeper."
658,0,"In "" The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a wothy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Exploring the solar system is one of the most fascinating things to explore. Finding places that will inhabit life other than just earth is something that presents some challenges. Is putting life in danger worth exploring Venus? The author supports his idea by naming the consequences, telling us how we could benefit from exploring Venus, and giving scientific reasearch. The human mind is filled with curiosity. The idea of living on another planted is exciting to some, but to others it seems too dangerous for exploration. The author states, in paragraph two, ""No spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" If a spcecraft cannot survive more than a few hours on Venus, then how can I human live of Venus? The author also states, in paragraph three, ""Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" These details from the text show just how dangerous it could be to explore Venus at a closer look. The author does present all of the dangers of exploring Venus. Is curiosity worth putting lives in danger? The author gives some supporting evidence as to how we could benefit from exploring Venus. The author states, in paragraph eight, ""Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" Our questions about Venus would be answered by getting a closer look. The author also states, In paragraphs six and seven, ""Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus. NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" Scientists are creating new and improved technology and spacecraft that we are benefitting from. The safety of traveling to Venus is being improved. The research that will be done on Venus will help us to grow more knowledgeable bout the solar system and the planets around us. Learning more about a planet that could inhabit life is beneficial to us. We need to get a closer look at Venus to aid our scientific research. The author states, in pragraph six, ""More importantly, researchers cannot take sample of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks."" We will never know if we can live on Venus unless scientific studies are done. Exploring Venus will be dangerous even if we can improve our technology and spacecraft. Our curiosity is what will drive us to explore beyond our fears. The author gave reliable reasons and research as to why Venus is a worthy pursuit despite all its dangers. We should exoplore what is close to us. After all, ""Venus is the second planet from our sun."" (paragraph one)."
437,0,"In the way i see it the author supported his claim very well.Now i mean yeah who is gonna want to risk there ife to go to this planet.but my paper is bout why you should despite the dangers.Because if you think about life is full of danger we just never seem to see it coming so this is i guess you could also say this is about not being so afraid to try new things in life. By the author explaining why we should go and study venusis quite odd but at the same time intreging'but also very dangerous now im not saying i would do it but from the way the author explained it it sounds challenging but fun because we get experince new sights.And i bet there is alot of people out there who didnt even know that venu was the closest planet to being just like earth here is a quote from the passage that hepls explain more about it.""Astonomers are facinated by venus becuase it may well once have been the most Earth like planet in our solar system,long ago"". Now for my conclusion,most people might say people from Nasa are crazy for even to consider going and or wanting to explore Venus. But in my opinion i would love to go to Venus and explore it but just not as close as Nasa, but its caught my interest to want to learn more about this giant fasinating planet and this is why.""Venus has the hottest surface tempreture in our solar system even though Mercury is closest to the sun.Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geolgy and weather present additional impediments.like erupting volcanoes,powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes seeking for probes to land on its surface"". Ok so in i hope no one gets to confused but i will be putting one pro and one con because we all know what pros and cons are.SO hear is i would say the con is,my con would be th fact that yes i could die within a matter of hours being on Venus and here are some information on that.""since no aircraft has survived the landing for more than a few hours.Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touhed down in more than three decades"".And now for my pro even though we know of the dangers no one really pays attention to the beauty in things like this because the way i see adn hear from what the author says this planet isnt all destuction here is why i say that,""Venus, sometimes called the evening star,is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky,making it simple for even a simple stargazer to spot"". Now this is my conclusion.So yes Venus is very destuctive and scary but it doesnt mean you cant see the beauty in this giant sister Venus. So i would say the author has a good idead but at the same time i think we as human should npushn our boundry's of the great planet."

You would be able to take care of horses, young cows, and mules. You would get to sail overseas. You would be able to have free time on your way. When I say that You would be able to take care of horses, young cows, and mules I mean that there would be 335 for all the types of animals. You would also get to have the chance to sail over the seas and have fun because you would be able to sign up with your buddy and travel together. The last reason is that you would be able to have free time to see things that people may never get to see in their lifetime. After reading these reasons that I stated I hope that you consider joing the Seagoing Cowboys. These are the reasons why I think that you should join.

The final reason is that you would get free time along the way to see things that people may never get to see in their lifetime."
1131,0,"Think about the planets in the solar system, how about Venus more than the others. Studying Venus is like trying to study the bottom of a valcano or the inside of Earth. The planet, Venus, has many challenging aspects. Although the planet has these challenging conditons it also is the closest planet to Earth in density and size, it is one of the brightest points in the night sky, and many scientists think that there may have been life on Venus before. Venus is the closest in density and size to Earth. ""Often referred to as Earth's twin, Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size..."" The planet is sometimes so close that scientists have tried to land spacecrafts on it. ""Because Venus is sometimes right around the corner--in space terms--humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world."" Venus is one of the brightest points in the night sky. ""Venus, sometimes called the Evening Star, is one of the brightest points in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot."" The name however is misleading. ""This nickname is misleading since Venus is actually a planet. In our solar system, Venus is the second planet from our sun."" Many scientists think that there may have been life on Venus before. ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" The features on the surface are somewhat like Earth too. ""Today, Venus still has some features that are analogus to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" Some people might argue that Venus is inhabitable and should not be visited by any human because of the highly corrosive sulfuric acid and thick atmosphere. ""A thick atomosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus."" However scientists want to create a ship that hovers safely over the planet. ""Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape."" ""...A vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way."" Visiting Venus and studying it would be ground-breaking for the science field. Even though trying to study Venus is like trying to study the bottom of a valcano or the inside of Earth, it would still help scientists to know what the planet is like. The planet is the closest to Earth in density and size, it is one of the brightest points in the night sky, and many scientists think there may have been life on Venus before. So, before people go right to thinking about the dangers of Venus, think about all the good that could come about studying the ""twin"" planet to Earth."
22668,0,"Dear State Senator, I am here to inform you that you should change election to a popular vote for the president of the United States. This is due to the fact that as of now Americans vote to elect their president, but what good is that if they don't even recieve what they want? What is even the point of voting? Saying this, I agree with source two on its point, ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. This is backed up with data from the same article stating that voters can't even control whom their electors vote for. This is clearly why ""60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" Without a doubt if you cared for your people, the people who support you and give you your job opportunity, you would see that you should abolish this electoral college. Even a blind man could see that. You may be wondering if your people think this is such a bad idea, why would our founding fathers impliment something so horindess? As you see ""electoral college was established in the constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens"", says source 1. Although that sounded great at the time, today electoral college is frowned upon because majorly because of its ""winnr-take-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. As if that wasn't unfair enough, the electors don't even necessarily have to vote for their states choice. This would be similar to if I was infatuated with a color, I then asked my team what our team color should be and after taking a vote, I chose the color I preferred because I was bias even though my whole team disliked it. This is obviously the wrong way to run our election ecspecially the most important in our country. On the other hand I do understand that there are some advantages to an electoral college. These include, mentioned in source 3, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaignthan a small state does. This is fair because there are more people in big states then small therefore big states should get more of a voice. Although in popular vote big states would still get the bigger vote because there are more people voting therefore they have more votes. This is why I think the middle man should just be cut out leaving us with a popular vote. According to the facts it is clear to me that the electoral college should be siezed. I think it is unnecessary as well as unfair. When we think of voting for our president, that is what we want to do. Voting for our president does not include voting for someone who may or may not choose our choice. Also if we chose our President by popular vote all the votes that weren't majority would add up and possibly make the difference between the vote results. This is why it is unfair to simply use majority rule for each state and practically erase the other votes off the table. As you can see State Senator your people vote to elect their ruler. Why deny them of this oppurtunity. It is clear to me that the electoral college may have been a good concept to our founding father but when applyed is not the best decision. This is why I think you should change to an election by popular vote for president of the United States."
8908,0,"Imagine that the computer you are sitting in front of right now caould tell you your emotions. It could tell you exactly how you're feeling. Prof. Thomas Huang and Dr. Paul Eckman created a software that can read your emotions. They suggested that it could be used in schools to give teachers and staff an idea of how their students feel about what they're learning. I think that it would be a good idea to have the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) in the classroom. Students may not like the idea but it could really help them. It could help students get focused again when things get boring. If the FACS sees that you are bored, it can help you get back on track. The system can also see if you're sad. If you are sad, the system could play a funny video, or some kind of motivational video to help you get through your day. The system can help teachers as well. Teachers could do an assignment and then give the teacher feedback on how everyone felt while doing it. Say the tecaher gave you a typing test and you were getting angry, she could lower the difficulty for you next time you take it so it becomes easier. The program could also send back a full report on how the class felt as a whole. If the results came in as 20% Happy, 40% Sad, and 40% Angry, the teacher would be able to understand the true feelings about the test. This coding software could even help parents! At the end of every week it could send a report on how their week went. If they had a bad week, the parents could help them have a better week next time. It can helpwith depression as well. The parents could see that their kid is sad all the time and find some ways to help. The FACS software could help many people, in many ways. Teachers can see how they are doing with their job, and see if students liked the assignment or not. Students would be able to get more help from teachers and parents. The students would be able to help their friends get happy again. Parents could get to see how their kids day has went, even when the child doesn't want their parents to know. Kids hide emotion from parents all the time, this would benefit the parents a lot."
15795,0,"Have you even seen the Grand Canyon, even if it was just on television you know that without a doubt, its real, its not camera magic or computer generated terrain. This ""face"" on mars is nothing more that a natural landform, no alien monument, no NASA hiding something its just a natural landform, just like the Grand Canyon. So, why is this so important? Well lets say this is an ""alien monument"" so if it is why wouldnt there be dead bodies on mars or more faces like this one, because this is not an alien monument, its not a corpes its a Mesa just like the ones that we have on earth. This really can not be anything more than just a natural landform due to the fact that in 2001 NASA took a picture of it and now it doesnt look anything like a face now it just looks like a little hill on the ground. Honestly the seventies were a really superstitious time. So I could see where they saw a face in it, but that doesnt change the fact that in 1976 their camera quality was bad. Even the 1998 picture was starting to reveal that it was just nothing more than a mesa that is certian conditions looks like a face. Today there have been studies that prove the human brain sometimes has a tendency to make inanimate objects look like a face, in fact today I say a face in the bumper of a car, but I still know that all that was, was a bumper of a car. I honestly understand some theories but this is just downright non sense. If it was an alien monument NASA would release it because then they would get really popular. So with all of these reasons combined it proves that this is just natural landform. It always will be."
20772,0,"Dear State Senator, In my experience, I strongly believe that you should get rid of the electoral college to a popular vote. If you do that, the votes would become fair to voters, and more voters would actually pay attention to the campaine. On the other hand, i do see why you would want to keep the Electoral college, but let me explain to you two of the many reasons why you should get rid of it. First, people do argue that the electoral college does pay attention to some of the regiment in voters. In Plumer's article he says,"" - thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election"" To me, the voters who do like the electoral college pretty much just want to see that they can trust them just for the popular votes to succeed. But honestly, I think they still shouldn't be the ones to choose. Even if they may help the popular votes a little, they aren't fair in a lot of ways. Way more voters are against them than with. So let me explain one of my reasons, I believe you should get rid of the electoral college is because it isn't fair to voters. A lot of the time voters don't trust that the electoral college pays attenetion to the votes sent out. Acorrding to Plumer's article, 'The Indefensible Electoral College:' he states, "" In the same vein, ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" When voters hear that, chaos starts. They want to have say for who the next President will be not just the electoral college's say. There have been some real incidents where the electoral college has voted based on what they believe and not other voters. For example, in Hawaii in 1960, The vice president, Richard Nixon, validated his opponents votes. Voters worry and get angry when there trust is broken. They want to be the ones to vote because of course they trust themselves. If you do get rid of the electoral college, voters would be more satisified and feel that their vote would be fair. Lastly, the second reason why I believe that getting rid of the electoral college is that voters would pay more attention and actually put thought in who they vote. If they think that their vote won't matter they won't care who wins. They would most likely jot down a random candidate and send it in. In the article, ' In Defnse of the Electoral College:', Posner states, "" Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were to be picked by a popular vote..."" With that said, there is support that states people would have beter interest in voting if they had popular vote and no more electoral college. I believe people would actually spend more of their time on debating who should deserve to be President. To conclude my reasons, please take them in consideration. Voters would be treated much fairly and pay more attention to voting than they do now. I believe you should get rid of the electoral college so there will be less arguing. Sincere, PROPER_NAME"
5245,0,"Have you ever seen another student and wondered how that person is feeling?Well thanks to Prof. Thomas Huang you can.Now as a teacher you can read the emotions of a student just from a glance at his/her face. This can come in handy to help student with trouble that could be going on els where.This new system will also allow a teacher to be able to help students in many other ways. Reading a students emotions can help out a teacher in many ways. One way could be the teacher being able to motivates the kids better.Teachers will now have a much easier way to motivate kids by understanding the emotions coming from the student during certian subjects.Teachers can use this tool to see what makes the kids happier when learning and then they can apply that knowledge to their own lesson planning.This new device can also help teachers find out when a student isnt feeling well or struggling. When a student becomes stressed or sad the teacher will be able to find out so muh quicker. When the teacher sees these emotions it will be easier to find out ways to help the student in areas they need help in. Knowing a students emotion will also help you understand them better.As a teacher being able to know how a kid is feeling is very important.Once a teacher is able to understand the stundent they will be able to connect with them this could make students want to engage more in learning.Now that teachers are better at knowing the students feelings they can also know better when a student is lieing. Being able to know when a student is lieng is always good as a teacher.The teacher will be able to resolve many situations where a student could be lying all because of their emotions. Even though emotions have universal signs not everyones feelings show the same, this can be hard on a teacher to understand oor know when a student is lieng or stress.Now this machine can help reveal most of these feelings. This new device can bring many valuable assets to a classroom.teachers that where never good with reading emotions can know exactly how a student is feeling. This will resolve many student-teacher conflicts and many struging moments for a student."
14925,0,"My opion is the the so called ""Face"" on Mars is that it is not created by aliens. Today I will ducuss with you why the ""Face"" was not made by aliens. I have proof that it is not made by aliens. First of all there is no proof to say that the ""Face"" is made my aliens. There is proof to say that it is not made by aliens. My first evenidence of proof is that it is a natural landform because we have things on Earth that are like the ""Face"", but do not have a face on it. These are called butte or mesa. Personally I belive it is a mesa. The other evenidence is that it is we have other camera with better quilaty that the Viking 1. In 1998 we sent it and there you can get a better look at the ""Face"" and there you can see that it is a natural landform. Some people might say that ""alien markings were hidden by haze"". So in 2001 on a cloudless summer day in Cydonia we took some other pictures the camera's maximum resolution so if there was an alien civilization you would be able to see it. In the picture you could not see any alien civilization or anything besides the ""Face"". In conclusion we have proof to show you that the ""Face"" is just a natural landform. It was not made by any alien civilization or what ever you think made it, it is just another natural landform on Mars."

Yes you can see how that person is ""feeling by looking at their face,"" but some people can fake a smile to hide whats going on inside, some people are just scared to let their feeling out because they are worried someone it going to hurt them. The ""funny things"" about people is that laughing can be really contagest when you are down in the dirt, and your friend sees that you're just upset, they will do anything to mke you happy they will smile you, make a joke. just to see you smile.

15872,0,"I am against driverless cars. I have made my decision about this topic. They are the Laws. The laws are stated that the moving veheicle regulation is that there needs to be a driver in the seat at all times. My next point is the safety. Safety is also apart of the law. Safety is required when in the cars, for the drivers they need the consentration. The passengers need to pay attention also and be safe. This world is evolving from old school things to brand new technology. I know people are getting sick and tired of doing and using the same old stuff over and over again. So they came up with this smart car system. The laws states all about being protected and following the law of driving. I mean whose going to blame the car when the driverless car ran itno this giant semi truck. Well see the driverless car is basically a car that is a computer. Computers can be overwritten. So the car can also be overwritten and it could do all sorts of bad things. So this passage is telling me that the driverless car is a good idea. I think this idea is a really bad idea to do. The safety for a human being or an animal is to be seated at all times while the car is in motion. If we use these driverless cars, it won't know that there is someone or something that is standing up while its in motion. Even if the car got into a wreck, the computer would not work right after that. What if there is new updates on the roads and the car doesn't know about them casue they have not been put on the internet yet. Those passengers might as well say ""hello"" to the hospital then. I know this world is evolving with new technology and thats great. But there is somethings people have to learn, perhaps to drive a car. I mean I wouldn't want a computer driving me around. Its not going to hurt the computer's feelings, cause its not a living breathing thing. People need to understand that someday their goning to have to grow up and do it on their own. I am against driverless cars because what if there were new updates on the roads and the cars do not know about them. Driverless cars have a better chance to get into a wreck like a drunk driver would. I know this world is getting new technology and that is fine. But people need to know how to do things on their own."
17228,0,"Contrary to popular belief, the Face on Mars is not a face, but a natural landform on the surface of Mars. Now, this may be hard to agree with, but the Face is actualy a structure similar to a butte or a mesa, a semi-flat landform common in the American west. It should also be noted that the area around Cydonia (a region on Mars on which the Face is located on,) is extremely cloudy around the time the pictures were taken by the Viking 1 in 1976. Also, Cydonia has many other mesa-like structures that are quite common in the area. The manner in which the Face was formed is unknown, but many scientists belive that shadows formed from outcrops in the area created the illusion of the eyes, the nose, and the mouth on the structure, giving it it's facelike apperence. There were three diffrent gruops of photographs taken of this structure. The first was taken by the aformentioned Viking 1, in 1976. The second was taken on April First, 1998, by The Mars Global Surveyer. The last one was taken in April of 2001, again by the Mars Global Surveyer. If this was a face, would'nt all three pictures be the same, insted of the last two being clear eveidence that the Face isen't a face at all, but rather a naturaly forming landmass? So, in conclusion, there is a scientific explanation to just why and how this strange and peculuar structure came to be. Even though this unusual sight looks just like a face, it's just a rock structure on the face of a red planet we call mars, not an ancient Martian temple."
20622,0,"Driverless cars, what all is good about them? Yeah, the driver could just sit back and go. But also, the car could mess up, have a defect, and it could crash. Causing multiple cars to crash, multiple injuries or deaths possibly. As stated in the passage, who would be at fault? The driver is just doing what the car is made to do. Sit back and enjoy the ride. The manufactures could do everything right, and the car could still mess up. Engines go out on cars all the time. These samrt cars eould mess up too. If a car swerves at the last second and hits you, then you won't be watching to try to miss the car. I don't think that automous cars are a good idea. They are too risky. I do believe that one day we will see them. But when that day comes, is the day that there are going to be more wrecks, more deaths due to automobile accidents, and more families grieving becuase they just lost their 16 year old son and 13 year old daughter who just died in a car wreck. Not because of a drunk driver swerving and hitting them. But because of a car defect."
12891,0,"I think that creating ""Driverless Cars"" should not be done. It can become very dangerous. What would happen in the event of a cyberwar. How about if everyone converted to ""Driverless cars"" what if there is some type of electrical surge that and destroyed everything that is using electricity then none of the cars would work. Another reason of why i think that we shouldnt have ""Driverless Cars"" is because who would be at fault in the result of an accident the company or the person in the car? It would be very hard to make a decision on that. The cars can never be driverless because what if the system has an error the company has to give the person in the car and option to control the car. But I still think that the company should be at fault if the car crashes while not under the control the the consumer. But if the car crashes while the driver is controling it while getting out of a driveway or driving through construction then the driver should be at fault. All together I am against having ""Driveress Cars"" becuase is dangerous. It can also be very expensive. There is a problem with who is at fault in the result of a crash. But for that I think that the compnay making the cars should make the consumer sign a contract saying that in the result of a crash the company is not responsible. Another reason is becuase what is the point of making ""Driverless cars"" for people to be more lazy. Overall I am against ""Driverless Cars"""
1722,0,"Venus is the second planet from the sun and the closest planet to Earth, in terms of density and size. Studying Venus would be a worthy pursuit despite the dangers beacuse if anything would happen to Earth it would be the nearest option for a planetary visit, we would learn more about Venus and the planet's harsh conditions, and Venus is like Earth in multiple ways like being able to support life. If anything would ever happen to Earth, Venus would be our closet option for a planetary visit. In paragraph two the text states,""Earth, Venus,and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus."" This piece of text from the passage shows that if anything were to happen to Earth, Venus would be our closet option for a planetary visit because Venus is one of our planetary neighbors and closet to Earth at times. Secondly, we should continue studying Venus because it will allow us to learn more about Venus and the planet's harsh conditions. In paragraph three the text illustrates,""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" This piece of text from paragraph three shows that we should continue studying Venus because it will allow us to learn more about the plant's harsh conditions and we would be able to see what materials could or couldn't work in such extreme heat. Finally, Venus is the planet that is most like Earth and use to have to ability to support life. In paragraph four the passage states,""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" This piece of text from paragraph four shows that Venus is the planet most like Earth and had the ability to support life because it use to be covered in oceans. In summary, we should continue studying the planet Venus despite the dangers because if anything were to happen to our planet, Earth, Venus would be the closest planet we could go to, we could learn more about Venus and the planet's harsh conditions, and because Venus is most like Earth and had the ability to support life. Furthering our research on Venus can only benefit us, so lets stop worrying about the dangers and get out and explore our planetary neighbor."
3214,0,"We have lots of nieghbors close to us from space by that I mean planets. Earth, Venus, and Mars orbit the sun at different speeds. Scientist would mostly consider Venus because they feel like it is more controlable than Mars. On the planet's surface on Venus is that they have an average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and pressure 90 times grater than what we experience(paragraph 3). These are verry high temperature and pressure for humans to encounter on earth, even if humans ever went to live on Venus, such an environment would crush our society in the deepest parts of the ocean and would liquefy many metals(paragraph 3). Beyond that high pressures of heat impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface, such weather like that can kill more than one hundred humans a day. Scientist and astronomers said that, "" long ago Venus was probably covered largely with oceans, mountains, craters, an valleys just like earth""(paragraph 4). NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray, just imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 0r so miles above the landscape on Venus(paragraph 5). They also said that the temperatures would be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrengeit and the temperaute would still be at close to that sea level on earth. Our travels are beyond but should not belimited by dangerous and doubts but should be expanded to meet edges of imagination aninnovation(paragraph 8)."
19959,0,"I think they should make driverless cars because the streets may be safer and less acidents would happen.The people against the idea no matter what happens in the future there is no way they wont invent it. All of the big names in cars such as Mercedes-Benz,Audi, and nissan have began making these types of cars they said as early as 2020 they should have it completed.The people and the companies who are starting this they know when their done there going to make a lot of money. In some states such as California,Nevada,Florida don't want these types of cars in there streets probably because there worried that it can cause a big didaster or some one getting ran over which can cost them millions of dollars. People can't prevent the future new things are bing invented till this day like drones. They might be dangerouse but if they dont test them how are they going to find out if it works. Its just like the new cars that we these days we have some of them can park by themselfs but for them to try it they had failier at the end they suceededing. If they dont invent something like this some other people will invent it in diffrent way theres could be faster and lighteror bigger and heavier. I think they should invent the new cars so we can have a less contaminated world and save the planet by useing less gas and by poluting the world less. These couple of years they have been inventing new things like chair that vibrare when there is danger."

The benifets are that you get to learn some new things and you might even descover somethigs you didn't know was there. "" Venus is actually a planet. In our solar system, Venus is the second planet from our sun ( paragraph 1)."" This quote helps the reader know some facts about venus. The dangers of exploring venus is that it can harmful.

10780,0,"Everyday the world is becoming more and more advanced in technology. In twenty years the world as a whole will look completley different than today. In twenty years, there might be driverless cars. Driverless cars would change the way that society lives and the way that it works. Driverless cars would be positive impact on the world. They bring the same amount of safety that human drivers bring and allow transportation tho become easier. Driverless cars would allow the safety that cars have when people are in them. In paragraph five the author metions sensors. These sensors would detect dangerous skids or rollovers. By having sensors this will cause the car to apply brakes on the wheels and take away power, like a regular driver. These sensors are allowing driverless cars to become even safer. For example say there was an driverless car and an animal jumped out in the middle of the road.The car would skid or brake on the road but no on would get hurt because there would be no one in the car. This proves that driverless cars have the same safety that cars have when there are actually drivers in them. Also mentioned in paragraph four, like today these cars would have sensors on the roofs, radar sensors, GPS reciever and motion sensors. By driverless cars having these sensors that cars have today and brand new ones the cars will be able to react to dangerous situations, such as not hitting an animal in the road. While people not driving at all would be great people still enjoy driving their own cars. By having driverless cars people could still drive by doing little or next to nothing. In paragraph seven, it explained that the car can handle driving functions at speeds up to twenty-five miles per hour. These cars can steer, brake, and speed up all by themselves. Even though the cars can do this the cars still alert the driver when the road needs actual human driving. So really the driver only has to be alert when they are going through a construction zone or accident. This system would allow the driver to still have easier transportation. Driverless cars would absolutey change the way that society works. This would allow transportation to become easier and more evolved. Driverless cars would also be just as safe as when there was a driver. Starting this system of driving would allow not just people but the world to become more advanced in technology. If one person has driverless cars then everyone could. This is something that would absolutly be a positive affect on the world and they will certainly be the future."
21554,0,I think that you should get rid of the electoral college because it makes the popular vote unfair. If you are saying we aren't voting for the president we want then we are just voting for the electoral voters we want without knowing that. The electoral college is unfair because if we vote who we want to then we will just get the votes of some electoral voter and if we vote for them they could vote for whoever they wanted to vote for. If everyone voted for someone thew electoral voters could just vote for whoever they wanted to and we wouln't be able to stop them either. We should change it to popular vote because the electoral college is unfair to everyone who votes for someone. Its not fair because the eletoral vote can make a president lose even if he had the popular vote is on his side. It should be changed because there is always the disaster factor. If their is a tie then they will just deny the will of the people. If they deny the will of the people it could have disasterous results. It should be changed because it is unfair and it always will have the chance of the disaster factor.
18639,0,"Why would an alien species make a face on the planet Mars? It just doesn't make sense that an alien species would do that. There is no evidence that aliens are real. We have found nothing that could prove that the face was made by aliens. We have done research and know that it is just a natural landform. We took pictures in 2001 of the face and found nothing. In the picture we would have seen everything. We would have saw some sort of proof of alien life. In the picture we saw a equivalent of a butte or mesa. Still no proof of alien life on Mars. There is no reason for us to hide that aliens built the structure. We wish aliens did build it, because our budget would go up. If aliens built it NASA would have told everyone immediatly. Conspiracy theorists think we are hiding it, but they can't give a good reason for why they think we would hide it. We have no reason to hide anything. In conclusion, there is no proof that the face was built by aliens. There isn't proof that aliens exist and that we hid anything. Why people still don't believe us even though we said all the facts, I don't know. Once someone has actual proof that aliens exist and they built the face, I will quit NASA. So answer me this question. Do you still believe aliens built the face on Mars?"
4409,0,"The author suggests that studying Venus is important for a few reasons. The first of which is that Venus is one of the most Earth like planets in our solar system. The second one is Venus could have once been able to be compatable for life. Another thing that the author brings up is that Venus has powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes. The final reason is that the author brings up the challenges that NASA is facing in trying to get to Venus. What the author is getting to is that when we finally figure out how to get to Venus this could help us get to other planets as well. That is why I think that the author wants us to study Venus. The first of which that the author brings up is the fact that Venus is the most Earth like planet in our solar system. Venus has a rocky surface similar to that of Earth's. It also has valleys, mountain, and craters all of this is similar to that of Earth's and can be used to maybe help us more understand out planet. Another thing that the author brings up is that Venus is similar to Earth is that scientist believe that Venus was once covered largely with oceans. This means that their could have been life on Venus such as plants. Another thing that was brought up was in paragraph three where the author talked about how Venus has powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes this is something that we also share with that is also happening here on Earth. If we could go to Venus and study all of that it could help us understand how to know farther ahead of time when we may have a a earthquake. The final thing that the author talks about is all of the challenges that we will face trying to get humans on the ground on Venus. The troubles that we face is the atmosphere and the pressure. These challenges make it almost impossibe for humans to withstand becase the pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience here on Earth. So what the author is getting at is that if we are able to get through all of these challenges and get boots on the ground on Venus, it would mean that when we are to explore or study another planet we can overcome these challenges much faster. So that is why I think that the author wants us to explore Venus. The first reason being Venus is one of the most Earth like planets in our solar system. The second one being that Venus was once able to be compatable for life. Third is that Venus experiences earthquakes and lightning striks just like Earth does. Finally the last thing that the author brings up is that going to Venus could help us travel to other planets with knowledge on how we can overcome the challenges from Venus. That is why I think that the author wants NASA to study Venus farther and learn more about it."
16241,0,"According to the article, ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" in the near future there will be cars that don't need to be driven by people, but will be engineered to drive themselves. Evidence from the article shows, there are both positives and negatives to these cars being released and used by the public people. My opinion is that the development of these cars should stop, and that they will overall have a negative impact on the public and cause much more trouble than they are worth. The first major concern of mine is the legalality of these cars. The article states that computer-driven cars are illegal to test in most states, so a person definitely couldn't ride in one in public. Only the states of California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia, are allowed even limited use of semi-autonomous cars. In order for these cars to even be released to the public, many states would have to change their laws and it would take a long period of time just to do that. There is also cameras placed in some of the driverless cars, and to me, that is complete invasion of privacy. I believe a person should be able to do whatever they want in their own car without having to worry about being watched. Another down-side to computer-driven cars is liability issues if a car were to get into an accident. Would the driver be the one to blame, or would it be the manufacturer of the car? There is no man-made object that is fool-proof, so why would computer-driven cars be any different? These are only some of the questions that people will face if companies do release driverless cars to the public. I am a firm believer than machines operated by people work much more efficiently than machines that operate themselves. I believe that cars are something that are meant to be driven by people, and if they try to operate themselves, many accidents and machine malfunctions will occur. There is already many malfunctions that occur in modern cars as it is. Also driving is meant to be an awesome experience for people new to driving, and if driver-less cars are developed future generations will be robbed of their chance to experience what driving is really like. My opinion is that the development of these cars should stop for multiple reasons, and that they will overall have a negative impact on the public and cause much more trouble than they are worth. The development of these cars should stop, because a great amount of money and time is being put into something that I believe will negatively impact the public. The issues stated above are only some of the issues that people will have to face if driverless cars are released to the public, think of how many more issues could possibly arise from computer-driven cars being released to the public."
9474,0,"The idea of driveless cars seems to be very unsafe. Though the idea would be an industrial breakthrough for 2020, there are still lots of worries to be had. One reason that driveless cars should not be supported is because they are not proven to be 100% safe. Every machine has a glitch, and a glitch from a driveless car could cause an accident or an injury. Who's to say for sure that the computer will know when to stop just at the right moment. For example, when driving down a busy street there are lots of other drivers. Some may not be as skilled as others. At anytime, there could be a distracted or intoxicated driver who swerves infront of you. The human instinct would tell us to turn into the other lane. Unfortunately the computer's mind might just stopthe entire car causing a chain accident of crashing cars. Other than safety, another issue with the invention may be the usage of gas and battery life. With so many features added to the vehicle, there would probably be a bigger chance of the car battery burning out. Yes, turning off the car does refresh the battery life, but the battery could possibly die during someone's ride. The same scenerio goes with gas. A self driving car will not pull over to the nearest gas station once it's on E. Also, a distracted rider, who could be asleep the entire time, would most likely not notice the amount of gas left. If the car runs out of gas or battery life, the car will stop leaving someone straned. The only way to avoid this situation would be to alert the rider itself, probably with a tone. Though it may help, there's still no garuntee that all people will be able to hear it. Besides gas battery life and safety, bad roads may also be a problem. Every person who's ever driven a car has atleast seen a pot hole, or a large hole in the street. Sometimes they can be really big and hard to avoid which just causes most drivers to go around them. Once again, a computer cannot think like an actual driver. The consequence of this would be the driveless car running straight into the hole. The hole's aren't usually deep enough to cause an injury, but they could but lots of wear on someone's tires. The tire could burst or in extreme cases become jammed, which could also leave someone stranded. The computer of a driveless car may not have enough artificial intelligence to avoid these hazards. In conclusion, with a driveless car there are lots of worries to be had. People who choose to risk their lives in this hazardous vehicle should think twice. The safest thing in someone's life is their own self mind. Saftey cannot rely on technology."

Venus is the closet planet to Earth in terms of density and size and the closest in distance too. Venus is sometimes right around the corner. Numerous factors conrubute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study. Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions of Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray. However NASA is working on another approaches to studying Venus. The concusion is that the challenge presented by Venus has value not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also becaue human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."
14195,0,"I disagree with the belief that the face on mars was created by aliens. I disagree because A team called the MOC proved to us that the face is just a natural landform by taking a picture ten times clearer than the original one. I understand that some might say it was a very cloudy day when they took the pictures, but the team took pictures a couple of years later and proved the same thing,again. The face on mars is just a natural landform. I believe it is just a natural landform because, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time in 1998. The team MOC took a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Although, some people still say it was cloudy and perhaps the alien markings were hidden by haze. It is still possible that they had gotten some very clear photos. On Apirl 8, 2001, on a cloudless day in Cydonia Mars Global Surveror went in for a second look. They used a camera with absolute maximum resolution. For example, "" Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" In conclusion, the face on Mars is just a natural landform. The pictures show landforms common around American west. The team have proved over and over again that the face on mars was not created by aliens. The cameras over the years have improved and the photographs became clearer."
20535,0,"I am with the whole idea of having driverless cars because then it creats more time to get ready in the car because it is really hard to do your hair an drive at the same time. And if you woke up lat eor something then you must get ready in the car, or you will look ugly for the day. I am with the driverless cars and there are many valid reasons why i am, but that reason was just one i made off the top of my head. Another reason i am okay with driverless cars is because it has many assitiance stuff, like sencors when you are to close to an object or another vehical. Another big thing i like about the driverless cars is because it keeps the car driving safley, also another big reason i like the driverless cars is because they would be expencive and not everybody would be able to aford them. As i said in my introduction, i really like the sensor function the the driverless cars. I like that function because growing up my mother was never a really great driver so she was involved with alot of car accidents,and most of them are with her rearending a car. Not all off the neccesarly but that is the onlyone i can remeber. That memory is pretty clear to me i dont know why but i remeber it was in her white cadiliack. It was a pretty radcar, but now with the sencors in the car she would hear the beeping and would stop driving because the beeping would scare her. So that is the main reason i like the sensor function. The second main reason I agree with the driverless cars is because they would be safe drivers and with safe drivers that means there would be less car crashes, and within less car crashes that means there would be less injured people and that means alot to me because im a generally nice person and i care about other peoples well being. And im sure im not the only one who feels like that. Well hopefully im not the only person who feels like that. And finally the third reason ilike the driverless car idea is because they would be more expencive then most cars, and that means poor people wouldnt be able to buy them and that would make me look better ebcause im not poor and i would be able to buy one of the cars.And as the conceidecd person i am thatwould look really good on my part. And im sure other people with money would also appriciate that they cost so much money because if they were cheap then teenagers with no driving knolage would go out and buy them and then just ruin them and that would be a waste of manufacturing. So those are my three reasons that i am down with the whole driverless cars idea. Im going to repeat the reasons that i like the idea, one because the sensors are nice, two because they would be good for our safty because safe driving, and lastly because theyre expencive. Those are all valid reasons in my opinion, and i think and hope that driverless cars are a thing in the near by future."
4822,0,No they should not use the technology in class rooms because thats a invashion of pricicy. And they dont need to know every little thing going on in our lives. Becouse every one need there privicy and if schools use that technology there taking that away completly. And why would you use that in a class room any way to spy on people thats a little creepy you know and also why would the teacher even what that becouse thats looking at them too. So there for in my choice the technology is not valuale and should not be put into classrooms or anywhere for that matter becouse every needs that privcy and no one will be able to get that if that technology is around. Another reason we should have it is becouse why would you want people to know your exact emotions anyways if they can read your emotions they can pretty much tell what your thinking by that. So that is the reaons I think we should not have the facial action coding systems.

To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a smiling"" This sentence tell us how they recognize if they are faking a smile of not or knowing if that person is telling the truth or not. And don't want some technology to know if I'm faking something or not. It's my personal business if I want that. Other people can use that for things but they have to ask for permission because how would you feel if someone found out about your true feeling and it was secret yet someone was snooping around of knowing how you feel."
12087,0,"I like the idea of driverless cars coming in the near future. The immprovement on this technology would help us in other areas that still need worked on. Driverless cars would help the military and police on special missions or car chases. Transportation would be faster if the technology is developed well enough. The amount of car crashes would decrease when the technology is accepted. When the military and police are in a chase to catch a terrorist they might not want to be in the front of the car driving. If the technology is advanced enough they could have shield built into the cars to help save lifes. The technology would help protect their lifes. In some places you can drive without a speed limit. When driverless cars come you might not even have a speed limit at all. This would also help with where to find car wrecks, work zones, and some short cuts. The driverless cars would help decrease the amount of car accidents. The technology could also improve safety with motorcycles and other vechicles. People would have to worry less about their safety. Driverless cars are a way to help the future of other vechicles. Driverless would improve life for the military and police. Less traffic jams would be caused with driverless cars. The amount of wrecks would be gone with the right technology."
10371,0,"Driverless Cars Is The Future The future is coming our way. Many automotive industries have began manufacturing the ""driverless car"". I believe that driverless cars will bring many positive reactions, and that the idea of a driverless car is very intelligent. Driverless cars will be a good benefits for the drivers and for the manufacturers. Driverless cars are beggining to be manufactured in many industries. Google already developed cars that could drive independently in 2009, but they are not completely driverless. This is just the beggining of their creation. Google says that their, ""cars have driven more than half a million miles without crash"". Which is a lot if you think about it no crash in a ""million miles"", thats incredible. Google's driverless car still alerts the driver during traffic issues and when pulling in and out of driveways, but like I said this is just the beggining of their development later on in time they will probably will have all the minor defects fixed. Although in the present time there is traffic laws that are written saying that the only safe car has a human driving it at all times, and driverless cars are not allowed in certain places. When the driverless cars are proved more reliable in safety there will be new laws covering their liabilty. Driverless cars would benefit the driver. The driverless car would only use have the fuel of today's taxi. This is a great benefit in the drivers perspective. They would not have to pay all that gas money, and we all know that gas is not cheap. We waste so much money on just paying for gas when we could be using that money to purchase other things. The driverless cars tha thave been developed can, ""steer, accelerate and brake themselves"". Which is great this would allow the driver to relax during driving. The current driverless cars have sensors that can detect danger. Meaning that when the car is driving and it detects something dangerous in its way the car will reduce power from its engine and apply its brakes, ""allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone"". Meaning that the technology can work that well under pressure while humans cannot. In conclusion I am fro the development of driverless cars.Our technology is so advanced right now, imagine in the future how good it will be. The driverless car is safe and provides many benefits for the driver and the developer. By providing the driver with less pressure about driving and saving gas money. The developer of course would benefit from all the cars that would be sold. The driverless car is the future."
7965,0,"The Facial Action Coding System, an innovative technology which allows computers to identify human emotions, would be valuable in a classroom environment to read their emotional expressions. Advantages to using the Facial Action Coding System, or FACS, includes staff and administration being able to understand students' feelings, creating a more efficient academic system, and students becoming more emotionally bonded. The FACS can read expressions depicted on users' faces, and can change up the material it displays based on them. In paragraph 6, the article states, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'"" This proves that the FACS would be useful in teaching, as students' emotions would be processed, telling teachers how well their students are comprehending material, thus helping them see what they are struggling with so they can be more clear, and what material they are understanding. With thr help of the FACS, administration could also, for example, put out school-wide surveys for the students to partake in. This would lead to a far more accurate pool of opinions represented by the student body. Administration would then be able to analyze the gradation of the students' thoughts on impending decisions, making a smoother functioning school system. Another intelligent outcome of the FACS in the classroom would be that students, teachers, and counselors would be able to more accurately communicate emotionally. This would reduce misunderstandings, tension, and drama among students. In paragraph 4, the article states, ""'The facial expressions for each emotion are universial,' observes Dr. Huang, 'even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression' (like not smiling as broadly). Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements-in a real fave or in the painted face of Mona-Lisa. By weighing the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions."" With the FACS, students and staff alike would be able to communicate feelings easier because emotions from all parties involved would be better interpreted and well-recieved."
9219,0,"A facial action coding sytem could help students improve in the classroom by knowing when they are confused or they need help with a question, and it could also help students that are being bullied. The facial action coding system may help students that do not understand a question, and this could help them recieve a better grade on it once the teacher is notified of their emotions. Emotion technology could also be used in the classroom to teach medical students what kind of pain a person is in. It could also stop the bullying problem, which would benefit students who are having trouble with this issue. While a student is in the classroom they may be confused about what they are learning, and the facial action coding system may be the perfect solution to find out what kind of emotions that person may be feeling. The facial action coding system may find out that the student is confused, and once it processes that information it could notify the teacher that the student is having trouble learning the information. Dr. Huang explained that ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"", and this could really help the student's grade if he or she needs help with the subject. This technology could also tell whether the student may need special tutoring, or if he or she needs to relearn the subject at a slower pace. Many students can be bored during the class, and this could help the teacher to know that she needs to make her class more exciting and fun for the students. This new technology could be very beneficial to the student as it could show whether the student is confused or bored about the subject he or she is learning. Students can be mean to other students, and a facial action coding system would be able to tell how the student is feeling during the school day. The computer would calculate the student's emotions, and if the computer thinks that the student is being bullied then the computer could send a counselor an email about the student, so the counselor could meet with the student. Dr. Paul Eckman says that he has found: ""six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness"", and these six basic emotions could help stop bullying. Facial action coding may be the answer to help students feel welcome at school and at home. It could also help students who are feeling bullied to chage their emotions, and they could stick up for themselves and not let a bully pick on them. Facial action coding could also be used for medical students learning how to become doctors. It could help the students know how the patient is feeling by their emotions, and the doctors might be able to diagnose them by their emotions. Doctors may also learn how to go through procedures better during surgery. Dr. Huang expresses that"" the same technology can make computer-animated face more expressive-for video games or video surgery"", and this technology could help future doctors learn their medical field better. Medical students may also be able to diagnose an issue with there patient more quickly because the facial action coding system could detect how much pain the patient is in. The facial action system could be beneficial in many ways. The technology has the potential to change student's lives. The facial action system may be one of the most important technologies to arrive in the classroom, and it could make the perfect learning environment for students."

NASA's Viking 1 was going around a planet and capturing pictues for a future place to land if they were to go to that planet, as they were going around they spotted a mark they sooned named it the Face on Mars, it reached nearly two miles from end to end it looked as if it was staring up at the ship. Scientits at fist thought it was just a shadow that looked liked a Egyptian Pharaoh. NASA soon let the pictures go public for all to see. Many people thought it was just giving an illusion of the eyes, nose, and mouth. It ingaged the public and attracted attention to Mars. On April 5, 1998 Mars Global Surveyor went over Cydonia for the very first time. Michael Malin and his MOC team took a photograh that was ten times sharper than the first Vikings photos. On April 8, 2001 Mars Global Surveyor got close enough for another look. Some people say it was created by aliens, but the people at NASA say it was just created by a natural landform. There have been other spots found similar to the one on Mars, found in the America West. It has reminded some of the people at NASA of the Middle Butte in Snake River Plain of Idho. Which is a lava dome that has formed mesa which is about as tall as the Face on Mars."

People need a car to far away places fast. cars are expensive, thats because people keep adding on to it and making it more fancy and of corse its going to be more expencive. If you limit cars most gas stations would be going out of bussniess and car places. gas stations buy the gas for cars to use yeah the gas is expensive but we need it and car dealerships would have so many cars they wouldnt know what to do with them cause no one would but them because there car would be limited to use so there car would be brand new. yes people are losseing alot of money from cars but its worth it cause we need to get places. if you make cars fancy yeah your going to have people to want to buy it but thats because you want them to buy it cars are killing the envirnment up though because the gas the people tearing into there grass people dont relize it but cars should just be used to get places and then stay there and then when there done go home. i mean if they can make a car that can scene if there drunk and wont start i would buy that car because it would tell you not to drive becaus eyou are drunk that will slove so many deaths and drunk driver accident problems. instead of making cars fast and look slicker and nicer and have the car talk to you with blootooth thats just dumb in my opion i wish they would just make cars more reasonable with things that really matter than just look nicer and more for rich people alot of people can afford cars so they should lower all prices and they would make more money becaus emore stuff will be sold like the drunk deceter car"

Having this new technology can improve a student way of learning a certian lesson. In the sixth paragraph is says "" ""A classroon computer could recognize when a student us becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" "" By having a computer recognize human emotions is can help pick out a different way the students learns or a more helpful way to explain a topic. Some student often may not understand a topic may may be affraid to speck up because they may feel jugded by others that do understand. Reading ones expressions can be hard, other people may not know how to express what they are feeling, but by having these computers that do it can help people know what others are feeling. The author says ""For intsance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."" With this it gives humans a new way of looking at stuff and seeing whats behind everything. This technology is a just one more step of what else is out there. Computers that can now identify human emotions what is it for? It can allow students see and understand a topic they may be confused by simpling just looking at there computer screens. It also helps tells people what others may be feeling when they can""t explain, helps us see in a differnt way. In conclution the use of the FACS should be used in classrooms to read students emotional expressons."
21774,0,There are some advantages and some disadvantages for having and not having a car. U need a car just incase for an emergency and then there is an a advantege for no having a car and that is less pollution in the air. First I like to talk about the disadvanteges for not having a car. not having a car means more walking or bike riding and then there is always being late to work or being late to something because you do not have a car to drive. people need to have a car because they have to go to work everyday are just to go have fun or go anywhere. The Second disadvatege for not having a car is when there is an emergency. If there is an emergency hiow are you going to get to the hospital or to the doctors if you dont have a car. Having a car is beteter than not having a car. For an example if a person gets hurt and needs to go to the hospital how are they going to get there if they dont have a car. The Third the thing I like to to talk about is the advantages for not having a car. Not having a car will help people got more excersice and help them move about around. Not having a car will help with having more money to spend on food or going out with freinds or family. The Fourth reason why we shouldnt have a car is having less pollution in the air. Also not having a car a will help with the space or room you need Cars can take up alot of space. Cars are also expensive. some people think its bad to have a car because they are expensive. Without cars you will see lots of people walking or running around. There is advantages and disadvanages for not having a car. Some reasons are good and some reasons are bad.
19307,0,"Driverless cars are coming. Is that a good thing or bad? Its an good thing. DIverless cars are going to be beneficial to us human beings. Driverless cars have been used before, have sensors, and most importantly safetly features. Such cars would fundamentally change the world. Driverless cars have been put to the test. Driverless cars have driven more than hald a million miles without a crash. They arent truly driverless yet. The car alerts the driver when he needs to take over to pull in and out of driveways. The car also alerts the driver when theres complicated traffic issues, like navigation through roadwork or accidents. Driverless cars arent fully driverless now but some day they will be. Driverless cars will have many sensors. Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a cideo camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor. All these things is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel. The sensors have become more advanced to detect and respond to the dangers of out-of-control skids or rollovers. The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply breaks on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone. These sensors are going to be a key factor to the driverless car. The most important feature for the driverless car would be safety. Safety is very important. In 2013, BMW announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" Which basically means the cars could steer, accelerate, and break themselves, but are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills. Driverless cars would notifily the driver to navigate through work zones and arounf accidents. The human should remain alert at all times and be ready to take the wheel at any time. General Motors have developed a driver's seat that vibrates when the the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. Another option would be flasing lights on the windshield. Manufactors are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road. While the driver watches the road, the car watches the road. All these safety features will be important to the driverless car. Driverless cars are coming. Is that a good thing? Of course it is, Driverless cars arent fully finished yet but have a bright future. They have shown so much in the few years. We (humans) have tested them out. We added sensors to help make the car smarter. We are also making the driverless car safe as possible. Driverless cars are going to be a great addition to the future."
16899,0,"On the arguement of the aspect of driverless cars, I am for the development of these cars. The U.S. and basically the whole world is advancing extrodinarily and at a fast pace. Driverless cars are a futuristic insight that kids in the past dreamed of. U.S. automakers have already developed technology close enough to the driverless car aspect, that they have already predicted when they should produce one. People of the past have tried time and again to try and improve the aspect of driving. In the 1950s, General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special, electrical cable track, sending radio signals to the car. Their idea for improvement was to make smarter roads, but the time and money that would take was to much of a sacrafice. With that idea out the window, manufacturers turned to the aspect of making smarter cars. For decades, manufacturers and automakers have been improving cars with more high tech and safety mechanisims. In the early 2000s engineers and manufacturers thought they did it. BMW announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" But the problem with that was that it wasn't completely driverless. The car was completely driving itself, it was more towards assisting the car owner because it would alert the owner when it would be a good opportunity to take the wheel because of un-controllable mishaps. Since then, manufacturers have been making more adjustments, making more improvements in order to achieve the aspect of a driverless car. Now, the concept of that dream is coming even closer to furition. Tesla has already projected the release of a car capable of driving on autopilot for 90% of the time this year. Mercedes Benz, Nissan, and Audi, four years from now, plan to have their cars drive themselves. Everyday we grow even closer our goal. The aspect of driverless cars is like a car ride using a GPS system. We drive our way down the road of making a driverless car. Everyday is equal to another minute on our road trip.We are driving our way to our destination until we've reached it."
1895,0,"The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by discussing the similarities between Venus and Earth, providing key examples of human innovation from historical exploration, and reviewing the value of exploration and human discovery. Logical and historical reasoning both help in the author's scientific persuasion for the continued research of Venus. As stated in Paragraph 4, Venus is reminiscent of Earth, even referred to as its ""twin"". The evidence that is presented in the paragraph provides the reader with a grasp of what our planet could look like. The extreme weather conditions that are detailed throughout the article seem familiar, which is a successful technique from the author that queries the reader of Earth's future, or rather the lack thereof. These examples provide a motivating reason to continue further research of Venus, to prevent our planet from becoming inhospitable. Besides keying in on the extreme weather conditions of Venus, the author discusses the the immense amount of human innovation that has been caused through exploration. The author also details the possible methods of transportation and documentation of Venus, describing an innovative reimagining of some of our current and past technologies. Paragraphs 7 and 8 detail the evolution of human computers, with the author later pompting our continued exploration and innovation through exploartion at the end of the article. These examples allow for a strong reasoning and imply that further innovations can be achieved through continued research of Venus. With the use of scientific logic, the author furthers his argument through historical logic. With the amount of research and scientific innovation that has been poured into studying Venus, the author decides to persuade the reader with historical logic. Our repeated exploration as the human race has led to an interconnected and innovative world, and the author noe prompts the very same idea for Venus. Human exploration is a key factor in continued research of Venus. In the Paragraph 8, the author concludes their claim of Venus by claiming that ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation,"" a quote that clearly states to the reader the cause for interplanetary human exploration. In summation, the author clearly dictates that Venus is a worthy subject matter of human research through a comparison of both Earth and Venus, the discussion of human innovation throughout history, and the scientific value of human exploration. The author successfully reinforces their claim with the use of logical incitement by presenting rhetorical statements, particularly in Parapgraph 8, prompting the scientific pursuit of Venus."

Another reason is because, if a child is being beat at home and the teacher comes behind him and he gets scared because he thinks its someone at home getting ready to hit him/her the computer could detect that and the teacher can call someone for help. A third reason is because, a student can be happy about their birthday or making a new friend or something and the teacher can have a good day knowing there is joy in his/hers eyes. That is why i think it is a good thing for a computer that tells emotional expressions should be in a classroom."

Taking the globe by storm this global phenomenon presents us with a more efficient enviornment, a huge drop in car accident tragedies, and a more functionable lifestyle. First and foremost, the given: a better enviornment. Air pollution is a global issue that has become very previlant in our society today. In places such as Paris, France, extremes as far as fines for those who drive around in cars are enforced as a way to fight it's overly dense smog. Also, the president of the United States, Barrack Obama, has set a goal to curb the greenhouse gas emissions in the country. When government iniative are set to such its obvious that it's becoming an issue. If everyone begins to enforce a car free lifesyle then the world will reach a tremendous turning point and will be able to preserve our planet for the future generations. Furthermore, it is known that car accidents are a common occuring issue whether it be small or deadly. Intoxicated or sober accidents can be just as bad. There will be no more bikers or pedestrians being hit and need to hitch hike will no longer be an issue as well. If we remove cars form our lives then we get the advantage of putting our society in a more safe way to transport. Finally, car free lving will make us a more functionable lifestyle. The need of having to go so far for simple things will no longer be an issue due to the fact that everything that would be essential would be easier and closer to assess. People would begin walking more which would very much so decrease the obesity rates in many places. Also the expanison of public transportation will mean that people are more likely to have a more direct stop near the places they go. In sumation, living car-lessly is a life lived less carelessly. It brings a coupious amount of advantages which means that everyone will have a safer, more funcitonable, and efficient lifestyle."

Does the car know what to do when there is an emergency? So if driverless cars are going to be made then what is going to happen to the normal gas running cars because i know these driverless cars are not going to be cheap. Driverless cars are great for teens that are just starting how to learn to drive because they wont have to do all the driving the car would do most of it and they will eventually get better and the hang of driving, these kind of cars could also be good for the elderly because some can not see as good anymore they either crash or get hit that is why this car would be great for them less accidents, no more getting lost. this driverless car has it all gps,sensors,video camera, who wouldn't want a car with all these features plus it's going to keep you and your family safe with all the protection it has added. Driverless cars well they ever be allowed on the streets who knows. Nissan,Bmw and the other company's that are trying to build these cars should go ahead and make them because nobody knows if they are going to work or aren't going to work.

It could be used in lie detectors in how someones face is when they lie. It would be cool if I can just look at someone and tell what they are feeling to help, or have fun with this friend. It would be a little weird if your computer are knowing how we're feeling, but it really could help students with web ads as it says ""if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow, But if you frown the next ad will be different."" That would be a cool thing to be able to almost actually enjoy watching ads instead of being bored by every one. It would be usefull to have the technology to know when a student is enjoying the lesson or not. So I believe that technology is growing in a exponential rate that is great and this idea that computer will be able to know how people feel about a certain topic on their computer just sounds cool."
19247,0,"Driverless cars would be a helpful tool in the future. They could help us get things done while heading somewhere far away. It could get rid of driver errors. Drunk driving could even by stop by this new product. This is why the driverless car should be allowd. First off the time you use to drive all the way down to Florida is about 12-18 hours. Lets say someone is going there for their job that 12-18 hours could be used for all sorts of things like making up for you job while your away or just finshing a project you did for this meet. It would be a great way to use your time instead of having to drive. This could be an amazing break through for somepeople who have to travel many times for their job. Secondly, if we have only driverless cars all driving they would know how to react to each other. This inturn would get rid of driver error such as drivers getting angry at each other. Another example would be cars speeding past each other, which cause recks. Driverless cars could bring down the death toll from car crashs every year by getting rid of driver error. Finally, a big problem today is drunk driving. If we had driverless cars the drunk drivers would never have to touch the wheel making the roads safer. The car its self could never get drug or slow down its reaction speed making it safer than with someone above.08. This could also bring down the death toll, for drunk driving crashs every year. These are all reasons i believe that we could be better of with driverless cars. It may cost more and their might be problems at first but in the long run it could save many of lives. Many states do not trust it, but i believe after they make they cars smarter they will see that they can driver better than any human ever could. Saving lives for many people which if worth it."
6243,0,"Technology has always been changing. All the changes have improved our lifes for the better or for the worst. One of the newest technology is the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). This system can classify basic emotion by measuring your face muscles. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. Three reasons for why are it helps modify the lesson, helps read non-verbal communication and helps produce emotions. Many students have had an online assigment that was boring to them. The teachers might not have realized if the lesson was not interesting or the students didn't understand it, since the students were behind a screen. If the teachers had the FACS, the computer would be able to detect the students emotions and change up the lesson to make it more fun or understandable for the student. This would help the students learn more better by having a lesson that fits them. According to the creator, Dr. Huang, the computor would work like an a human instructor. There are two ways a person communications to one another. Those two ways are verbal and nonverbal. According to Dr. Huang, the most human communication is nonverbal. The students use nonverbal communication, mostly to show how they feel about the assignment. So if the tecaher doesn't catch the student emotional expression the computer would. The computer will then notify the teacher about it so he can change up the assignment or explain the assignment better. Many people who are feeling down, try to fake their smile. Well, according to the creator, FACS would be able to tell if it is forced. It is going to be able to that becuse it will measure the muscles on your face such as the zygomatic major, oculi pars palpabraeus, and the risoriuos. Even if it is fake eventually it would be able to produce actual happiness. This would work in a classroom, if the students are in a acting class and have to fake their facial expression to fit with the scene. The computor comes into this by reading the student's facial expression, and telling the student how the computer thinks the student feels. In conclusion, the use of the FACS is valuable. It helps modify the lessions, helps read nonverbal communication, and helps produce emotions. It may come with its flaws, but we will improve it so it can be properly used in classrooms. FACS is the new future of the use of technology that will change the way we learn. Not only would it improve our ways of learning, but also help us understand the science of emotions better."

However, driveless cars shouldn't be completly driveless. There should still be some type of human interaction involved. Wether it's a hand sensor on the wheel or a camera that watches you to make sure you're paying attention. It's not good to trust a machine 100%. Anything could happen. Driveless cars can be good for people who don't have legs. The person wouldn't have to keep their foot on the gas, they could pay attention to the road and keep thier hands on the wheel hand sensors. The drivless cars could also be good for driving on long highways for hours with no traffic. At the same time driveless cars can be really dangerous. For example paragraph 8 asks"" Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for thier turn to drive?"". I belive someone would get bored just watching the road and fall into deep sleep. The cars can malfunction as well. I never trust machines 100%. Maybe when there's no human interaction for a period of time the car can automatically pull over to the side and make noises and vibrate until the driver wakes up. So that is my opinion on driveless cars. I think driveless cars will be a nice new addition to our everyday lives."
22002,0,"There are many advantages of limiting car usage. Decreasing the amount of time citizens use personal motorvehicles positively impacts the environment and the state of mind of people. The lack of driving personal cars is becoming more widely accepted in several countries for different reasons. Vauban, a suburb in Germany, is an experimental district testing the lifestyle that does not use cars. Paris banned driving for environmental reasons, and Bogota decided to try it out too. Also, it is a trend in America for the purpose of saving money and because there are other convenient options. The decrease in fumes from cars is very beneficial to the environment. People and organizations are making drastic efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. According to paragraph five of ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" twelve percent of greehouse gas in Europe is caused by passenger cars and fifty percent in some areas of the United States. The Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities because emissions from cars contributes to half of the pollution in America. In the Article by Robert Duffer, ""Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog"" he describes the event that Paris had to declare a ban on half of the drivers because the large amount of smog that lingered over Paris. Colombia even has a day dedicated to being free of cars to reduce smog and promote alternative transportation. All of these events show the severity of environmental problems caused by cars and people making efforts to promote a better environment. Also, a decrease in personal motor vehicles causes people to have a better state of mind. Heidrun Walter states, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" With a car comes a lot of responsibility which leads to a lot of stress on a person. Not having a car is one less bill to pay and thing to take care of which for many people is a better way of living.""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" stated Carlos Arturo Plaza on car-free day in Bogota, Colombia. The car free day has also promoted other things to bloom in the city such as parks, sidewalks, and restaurants that people really enjoy. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal in her article ""The End of Car Culture,"" her children have other priorities than recieving their license because they have other things they would rather focus on that they enjoy more. All of these things promote people living a healthier and happier life. Overall, limiting car usage is a ""win-win"" situation for everyone. Decreasing fumes and the stress of a car causes the environment and people to be happier. Promoting public trasportation or other ways of getting places is better for everyone. It is a growing trend all over the world, and for a good reason. A lack of fumes from cars will clear the air, and clear the minds of fellow citizens."

I think things should stay the way they are, there would be many problems with a driverless car, and would people be able to even afford them? Yes, driverless cars sound really amazing, but I think the cars we have today will be just fine. With normal cars, there are many crashes. I feel like with driverless cars there would be a problem if somebody gets in a crash, because then they will blame their car and they would be able to get away with something that was actually their fault. Maybe it would be difficult for cops to figure out who did the crash since its a driverless car and many technical difficulties could happen. The article even says that if theres an accident, whos fault will it be? The driver or the manufacturer? With a normal car, it would be obvious who crashed the car and why. The cops won't have as much trouble finding out who crashed. I just don't think driverless cars are necessary at all. We should just keep the normal cars that we have today. A lot of technical difficulties happen everyday with computers, phones, laptops, and a lot of other technology. Since it says in the article that the cars would be computer-driven, i feel like a lot of technical difficulties will happen. The car wont always be perfect and not have problems. What if a technical difficulty happens and the car runs over a pedestrian and kills the person? It could happen with a lot of these driverless cars and maybe the person in the car could become traumitized from seeing the dead pedestrian or become depressed from feeling like it's his/her fault. Also, maybe the car can kill the people inside of it by accidentally running into a tree, a river or lake, a building, and many other things that could seriously injure or kill the people inside of the car. Many technical difficulties could happen, which would make driverless cars not be used anymore. If we dont use them in the future, maybe many lives could be saved. I dont think the driverless car willl be perfect, technical difficulties could definitely happen. If driverless cars do ever happen, I feel like they would be really expensive. Not many people would be able to afford them. Since a lot of people wouldnt be able to afford them, i dont think many would be bought. So might as well not sell them. Also, I feel like if something from the car breaks on accident in a crash or something, it would be very expensive to replace the broken parts. I think people should just save they're money for something else and not buy these cars. They would be way too expensive. I dont think driverless cars should be used in the future. Things should just stay the way they are, there would be many problems with a driverless car, and people wouldnt be able to afford them."
24199,0,"Dear state senator, I wish to inform you about my opinion and another 60 percent of voters opinions about the Electoral college. We suggest that instead of voting for a state of electors we should vote directly to the president that we wish would lead our country. People wan't to vote straight fowardly to the exact person they perfer and not to electors whom the people can't control who they decide to vote for. Some electors have refused to vote for their party's canidate and vote for whoever they wanted to instead. Many people often get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong canidate. We also cannot choose who the electors are. We know that the state legislatures are responsible for picking electors and that the electors that they choose always defy the will of the people. Many things can go wrong when we use electors. They could cheat into getting who they want to win. Just like how in 1960, the segregationists the the Louisiana legislature almost succeeded in their dirty plan to replace the democratic electors with new electors that would oppose John F. Kennedy meaning that they tried to get the popular vote that was for him to actually not get to Kennedy. Also, a state might send two slates of electors to congress. It's happened in Hawaii in 1960, what makes you think it won't happen again? The electoral college is unfair to voters because of all the ways electors cheat to make sure who they wan't wins. Canidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the canidates at all. Also 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see any campaign adds and its because of the winner-take-all system in each state. We suggest to changing to the election by popular vote for the president of the Unites States. The citizens of the United states should be able to vote for the president that they perfer and not for an elector that could ditch the original idea and vote for only their personal opinion. There would be less flaws in the presidential electing process if we accept the popular vote method."
4732,0,"Whats the Facial Coding System you asked? What does it do? how does it help? there are many questions for this new software that was invented by Dr. huang. The FACS is a software that dectect the feelings that a person have at that moment from their muscles. Many people have more questions to ask about the FACS that will be answered later in the story. ""Shes 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"". How did they find that out it starts off when the comuter creates a 3D model of the face and its speaks about what is going on throught that persons head. The software can identify mixed emotions cause each expression is compared against a nuetral face which is showing no emotion. Do you think that the FACS could be used in a classroom? is it a good idea? I honeslty feel like it would be a waste of time because i dont see how determining feelings have anything to really do with school. I feel like its losing money when there are things that the kids could use on the laptop and computers that will further their education in being better in a subject. We are all humans all of us make the same facial expressions not much of our expressions change from one another. By us just looking at a close friend we know when theres a problem when they happy, mad and sad so why would we need a system for it to tell us that. "" most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"" says Dr. Hang so if we could have emotional communication can the comuters have the same thing. Communication is always key but having to use a system to detect a persons feelings when they could just tell us. The FACS in school I just dont see where does it fit in with education. If FACS was to be in schools what would it be teaching children? will they find it interesting. the things that are taught in school are taght for a reason and a software that just shows emotions I dont see anything that the kids will be learning from that. I feel like if FACS on a school computer or laptop on a software it should be more of a activity than something they are just learning. I think the kids would enjoy for it to be a activity for high school it would be a big difference because people have careers and finding out emotions and what people are thinking would be a great idea to use FACS as a software. ""humans perform the same impressive calculation everyday"" although we do have the same expressions when we do things but a person dont even know when their showing an emotion when doing it. only your close ones would really know how you would feel about something but moral of the story i feel FACS would be great for high school for those who would like to have a career that involves more with knowing a persons feelings. But other than that I do not think it would be very valuable."
8989,0,"I believe the technology described in ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" would prove to be extremely beneficial to modern classrooms that rely heavily on technologies to instruct students. In an age when online schooling has become a mainstream learning option for many students, as well as almost all schools providing computers for instruction, this facial recognition would be able to detect when a student has lost focus and is in need of assistance. This would in turn increase not only the vigiliance of instructors, but also the effectiveness of a lesson. Although the computer needed to run such a technology may not be readily available to most classrooms, the overall effectiveness of the Facial Action Coding System would prove to be a invaluable tool when utilized by educactors. Emotional expression reading technology would provide a net increase of classroom instruction efficiency. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a sutdent is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson.."" The modification provided by the computer would recapture the focus of distracted students, who are perhaps using their cell phones, and modify the lesson based on their specific facial responses. Not only would the increased assistance from the Facial Action Coding System increase the effectiveness of a lesson, but it would also help ease the load placed on singular instructors. Instead of simultaneously watching the class and demonstrating material, an instructor with the assistance of the Facial Action Coding System would be able to shift their entire focus to the lesson at hand. This would greatly increase the quality of the instruction material, thus proving its value in a classroom setting. In summary, the Facial Action Coding System would prove to be most essential to today's modern classrooms that are plagued with distractions. Computers with this system would identify lagging students and modify lesson instructions to regain their attentions. This would allow for teachers and instructors to shift away from their roles as disciplinaries, and engross themselves in classroom demonstration and the effectiveness of their lessons. The Facial Action Coding System would provide an extreme boost in efficiency to the learning experience of students across the world, thus proving its extreme value in a classroom setting."

These cars will be one of the smartest things you will ever see. Just think how smart your phone is, your car will be twice as smarter than anything in this world. The smart cars will stop you when you are about to hit something. Just think when you are driving and you get scared and don't know what to do the car will push the breaks for you and you don't have to worry about anything.

How do you feel about a car that will drive for you? Thinking about a car that could potentially drive for you sounds a bit scary. Looking at the statistics of automotive accidents, they would be sure to increase significantally due to the technology being new to everyone and them not being used to it, but also dysfunctions with the car itself. The new technology would be great, but only if when it's used it's very regulated such as having special tracks the cars drive on. If it gets regulated, companies who own tracks the cars are permitted to drive on could have insurance that if something happens they're fully covered. This would help with a lot of the law suits, and also a written contract should be signed stating that you agree with the terms of use. In conclusion, driverless cars would be a nice thing to have but only if regulated and restricted on state roads. The way technology is expanding maybe one day a car will be invented that would be smart enough to drive on roads, but we haven't gotten to that point yet. As for now driving should be left to humans not technology, that's getting too risky for your own safety as well as others."

I believe that we shouldn´t have cars that are driverless because we will need to have some high technology stuff, no cars will ever be completely driverless, and they would be have to add special features to the car to alert you when it´s time for you to drive. I strongly believe that we shouldn´t have cars that are driverless because we will need to have some really high technolgy to be able for the cars to operate correctly. For example, we will need stuff like position sensors, roatationg sensors, sensors on the roof a video camera mounted on the car. All these things can be very expensive and where will they be getting the money to make hundreds of driverless cars. I also strongly believe why would we have driverless cars if they will never be completly driverless. For example, in 2013 BMW announced the development of ¨Traffic Jam Assistant.¨ They also announced ¨none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless.¨ So I don´t see why they would want to waste money and time if they havent had a car be completely driverless so far. Another reason why I strongly believe that we shouldn´t have driverless cars is because they would still need to add special features to let you know when it is time for you to drive since they still haven´t had a car that is complety driverless. For example, they could add flashing lights on the windshield, heads up displays, and cameras to watch that the drivers stay focused. I mean all this sounds even more of a distration that someone just driving theor own car to where ever they need to go. In conclusion I believe that we should not have any driverless cars because we will need to have some high technology stuff, no cars will ever be completely driverless, and they would be have to add special features to the car to alert you when it´s time for you to drive."

Of course there are some down sides like storms, but if you take this job seriously, the view of sunup and sundown will make your day very happy! Reason number one is the fact that you get to to take care of all the animals! The types of animals you take care of are: horses, young cows, mules, and more! You'll feed them, give them water, and clean there pens. If that doesn't sound nice to you, reason number two will definitly wake you at least kinda want to join the Seagoing Cowboys program Reason number two was one of my favorites, the beautiful sights! On every trip, we see at the least one beautiful sight. We toured an exavated castle and it was very beautiful. Reason number three is when we arrive on land, people unload the animals while we get to play a bunch of games! We play vollyball, baseball, table-tennis, fencing, boxing and more! If you aren't into thats stuff, you can always do something yourself like reading or whittling. My last and final reason is the view of the beautiful ocean. On sunny days when the ocean is calm, you can go on the deck and just look at the way the sun shines on the ocean. Even at night the moon sometimes gives enought light to shine in the ocean, and it makes a very pretty reflection. If I had to describe the beauty two words they would be, very beautiful.

This capability allows us to make guesses on what people are currently thinking about. One use for this new technology would be the addition of emotion-detecting cameras to classrooms in attempt to make the class more enjoyable for each student. The potential to use this in a classroom would inevitably help the way some people learn, however It will likely do more harm than good. If the main focus would be on the enjoyment of the class, and changing the course based on how students react to it, then many issues would begin to appear. The first being that everyone is different, and everyone learns in slightly different ways. If a camera detects that one student is bored and struggling, it may change what they do in class to something that everyone else may not enjoy. The same situation applies if the camera detects someone that really enjoys doing something, so it may add simmilar schoolwork to the class. If a student was struggling with that method of learning they would suffer due to someone elses ability to learn. If the main focus was something not based soley on education, and was more about the student being happy during class, there would be more options. The article mentions the computers capability of recognising the true emotions of someone, making it impossible for a student in class to pretend to be happy. If an emotion-detecting camera in a school often finds that someone is truely depressed, the school may be able to take action in a few ways. They would have the capability to reccomend the student do some sort of facial movement that would make them happer as mentioned at the end of the article, or they could send the student to a qualified professional to help them deal with depression. Overall, the facial recognition and emotional detection devices are capable of a lot of things that can improve the world. However, within a classroom setting, using a system to make everyone happy is essentially impossible due to the many different circumstances at play. A better way to attempt to make a student happier would be to do something similar to whats mentioned in paragraph 9. If students were required to to some sort of facial movement at the start of class, they may be set to a more enjoyable mood."

20984,0,"To Whom It May Concern, The Electoral College that is used when electing the president is a flawed system and should be replaced by and election by the popular voted. The Electoral College does not always show what the people want and it is unfair to voters in certain states. The Electoral College should be replaced with an election by popular vote because it is not always a fair representation of what the voters want. This means that if most of the popular votes can be for one candidate, but the other candidate wins the majority of the Electoral votes. This is shown in the article In Defense of the Electora College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner. In thsi source the author states,""But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed)...[;however,] it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral voter will not win the popular vote.... It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush, but fewer electoral votes""(Posner, Line 16). This shows how what the mahjority of the people want to happen, will not always happen in this flawed system. This system is also unfair to voters in certain states. Candidates usually campaign in what are called ""swing states"" that could vote for either candidate, but this means that many states that candidates are confident of winning in or states they are sure of losing in, will not be campaigned at all. This unfairness is shown in the article The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer. This article says,""Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they have no chance of winning... During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all,including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't see a single campaign ad""(Plumer, Line 13). This unfairness causes voters in some states to be uninformed about the candidates which could cause them to vote for people they wouldn't if they had seen some campaigning. The Electoral College is a flawed system that is unfair to voters and does not always reflect what the citizens want. Sincerely, PROPER_NAME"

This new technology could examine your facial expressions to see if you are happy or sad. If an ad plays that you get sad or mad about this technology will play a different ad that expresses happy feelings to make you happy and put a smile on your face. ""Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anaomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions."" The new developing technology can read your facial motions. ""By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpiece)."" This software can read any type of facial expression and simpily make your day better. If you are already happy this software can just make you smile even more while you are on your computer. ""Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion)."" ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This software would help so many students out because of how many students get bored with a lesson on the computer. This technology could help students get better grades and just makes school so much exciting for them.

This new software would be great for so many people at their computers, even students at school using the computers."
20810,0,"First of all, what is the Electoral College? The Electoral College is a process, not a place. This process consists of the selection of electors, the meeting of electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and counting of the electoral votes by Congress. It consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 is requited to elect the President. In other words, under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors. And that`s what`s wrong with the Electoral Project system. For example: If you live in Texas, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you`d not vote for this candidate, but for a slate of 34 Democratica electors pledged to John Kerry. But who are these electors? Who picks the electors in the first place? Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always The electoral College is unfair and irrational. Voters don`t want to vote for a bunch of strange people. The voters in fact, wanto to vote for someone who they had chose. We son`t want to put our decision on someone else`s hand, we want to be in control of our own vote."
3346,0,"In the article ""The Challange Of Venus"" the author suggest that studying Venus is worthy to pursuit because our earth and beyond shouldn be limited by danger and doubts but should grow to meet our imagination and innovation. Venus is the closest planrt to Earth and accasionally the closest in distant too. Scientist have sent many spacecraft to land but each previous mission was unmanned because they could only get to cloud-draped and be there for a few hours. Whitch explains why a single spaceship hasnt touched down on Venus in more then three decades. The reason why its so hard to explore Venus is because almost 97% of carbon dioxide is covering Venus, and the most challanging part is the cloud of highly corrasive aurfuric acid in Venus atmosphere. Aparrently Venus is the hottest surface temperature of any planet. It has been a difficult mission to go there. Long ago, Venus was covered largely with ocean and could have supported various form of life, just like Earth. Till this day Venus still has the same feature that are similar to those on Earth. Venus has rocky mountains, valleys, and craters. They even say Venus can someday be our nearest option for planetary visits. The National Aeronautics and space Administration has an idea for sending humans to study Venus. Imagine being able to live on another planet. This challange to go to Venus has a value, not only because of the insights on the planet its self, but because Venus can also become a home to use. Danger and Doubts should not limite our ways to explore but should expand, to be able to meet our imagination and creation."

There might be people in the world that don't care,but wouldn't you want to help an helpless animal. There are a lot of people that try and try to find a job but it is so hard working two jobs, or your working a lot of hours,or maybe you don't have a job at all,but the Seagoing program helps you with all of that. They even say that 44 nations joined TOGETHER to form the ""UNRRA"" (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration).Actually the UNRRA hired the Seagoing Cowboys to help animals and stuff,so the Seagoing Cowboys are in really good hands.

The Seagoing Cowboys also get to travel a lot. We get to go to places like China,Europe,and New Orleans for buisness trips. We help many people around the world and we fight strong and get the work done.

9997,0,"In this article, I am against the development of driverless cars. This article has many negative aspects of driverless cars. I am against driverless cars because the cost of making them is expensive, the driverless cars could make the driver very bored, and it would be a hazard if there are malfunctions with the machine. Those reasons support my position on being against driverless cars. I am against the development of driverless cars because they are expensive. I believe they are expensive because they would have to upgrade the roads, make the car smarter, and all of the machinery the companies need to build a driverless car. The article states, ""They required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical."" Also to make the driverless car companies will need to make the car smarter and add many machines to the car. The article states, ""Manufacturers turned to smarter cars—but how much smarter did the cars need to be? For starters, they needed a whole lot of sensors."" That quote means to upgrade the car, there would be many machines used, such as sensors. Another reason why I am against the development of driverless cars is they could make drivers in the car very bored. They could make the driver really bored because the article states, ""This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" That quote means that human drivers would have to sit there and wait until there is an alert for the human driver to take over. Also this article also shows us that human drivers will get bored, ""Wouldn’t drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?"" Those quotes show us that human drivers could get bored being in a driverless car. My last reason why I am against the development of driverless cars is that they could have malfunctions. The development of driverless cars could lead to malfunctions on the road. The driving laws might need to be changed because of these driverless cars. In the article it states, ""New laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident."" Also, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault—the driver or the manufacturer?"" Those quote mean that there would be new laws needed for driverless car just in case a driverless car has a malfunction. Those were reasons why I am against the development of driverless cars. The cost, the drivers being bored, and the hazards that the driverless cars can bring. That is why there should not be driverless cars."
731,0,"A thick Atmosphere containing 97% carbon dioxide, Venus is a dangerous planet. It's extremely high pressures and dangerouly scorching surface, it is beyond comparison to Earth's environment. Although its proximity to us is closer than that of mars, its reputation precedes it as a challenging planet. Despite the dangers, Venus is a worthy pursuit because it was once an Earth-like planet in our solar system. To start off with, it's geographic features are similar to that of Earth. In the article, on paragraph 4, it says, "" Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various life forms."" On paragraph 4, further down, it says, "" The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and inlcudes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" Based on these two evidence, Venus's features; which once included rocks and oceans, can be found on Earth. Next, the technologies provided by Sophisticated Organizations and companies can help through the exploration process. On parargraph 5, it says, "" NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions...would allow scientists to float above the fray."" As we move further down the paragraph, it says,"" Solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed Earth levels."" From these two evidence, NASA's solution can be benefical because the explorers wouldn't be exposed to the surface; they can avoid the unfriendly conditions, and they can gain acess to the solar power needed to power the machine, it's a win-win. Then finally, the studying process. On paragraph 7, it says, "" Some simplied electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber stimulating the chaos of Venu's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditons."" From the same paragraph, it says, "" Systems that use mechanical parts can be more resistent to the pressure, heat, an other forces."" From the simplied electronics to the mechanical parts; which both have been proven useful in the conditions of venus, can be used to collect data. the mechanical parts won't melt and 3 weeks for resisting the conditions is extremely useful, these are the solutions that can be used o study Venus. To end this essay, Venus is worthy due to the similarities it posesses. From all those planets, it was Venus's proximity and it's features that are analogous to that of Earth. Scientists can learn what happened to Venus through the technologies given. These technological solutions provides safe ways to travel and to collect data from Venus. Despite the dangers, it is the only planet that was Earth-like, it's time frame for space travel is much less than that of Mars. This is an opportunity of the time, and the author is trying to inform us that we should take the opportunity and explore. We have the technology, we know that venus is close to us, and the fact that it was once a twin of Earth, that's fascinatiing. Aren't you curious to find out what happened to Venus?"
14942,0,"There will most likely be a future without the transportation system that we know today. Driverless cars will probably be used in place of both public transportation and personal transportation. The problem is, driverless cars might not be the best thing for us. Driverless cars should not be developed because they aren't completely driverless, they are inconvenient, and they aren't safe. The first major problem with driverless cars is that they aren't completely driverless. This can be seen in paragraph 2 of the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" when the author writes, ""...Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over."" And in paragraph 7, the author states, ""In fact, none of the cars developed are completely driverless."" This shows that there are still things that the driverless cars cannot accomplish and the use of a human driver is completely neccecary. Another issue with the driverless car is that they are expensive and inconvenient. The cars require a bunch of sensors and electronic tools that will raise the cost of cars. In paragraph 4, the author says, ""For starters, they need a whole lot of sensors. Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reviever, and and inertial motion sensor."" That is a decent amount of tools that will need to be added to a car, not including what is needed to make the car drive. Also, because the cars aren't completely driverless, drivers will have to keep hold of the wheel. This is seen in paragraph 7 when it says, ""...special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" This is inconvenient because even though the car is driving itself, drivers still have to be alert and be ready as if they are driving the car. This will caus drivers to get bored waiting to see if they will have to drive. In paragraph 8, Dr. Werner Huber states, ""The psychological aspects of automation are really a challenge."" This reveals that it is inconvenient to have the car driving while the driver is waiting in case she has to drive. Another inconvenience is that in some of the cars, they can only handle really slow speeds. Paragraph 7 states, ""The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph."" This is inconvenient because most of the time cars drive at speeds faster than 25 miles per hour, and the feature of the driverless car will not be used very often. Because of all of the equipment required to make a driverless car run, and how little the feature will be used, driverless cars will be inconvenient and aren't worth being developed. Most importantly, driverless cars aren't safe. In most states, driverless cars are illegal because lawmakers are concerned about their safety. This can be seen in paragraph 9 when the author states, ""In most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars."" This reveals that states don't even think it is safe to test the cars, much less use the cars on the road. Even manufacturers acknowledge that there are many issues with these cars. Paragraph 10 states, ""Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved."" This shows that the automakers see the problems but are just assuming that they will go away. The reader can imply that the safety is being ignored because they are just assuming the problems will go away. Although driverless cars are perdicted to be the mode of transportation, because of the fact that driverless cars aren't completely driverless, they are inconvenient, and they aren't safe, driverless cars should not be deveoped."

They put into detail that ""Venus's reputation as a challenging planet fir humans to study,despite its proximity to us"". They state that it is challenging to study venus but they have been trying there best and they are getting there.Slowly but there getting there.They know that the atmosphere of almost 97 percent of carbion dioxide is over venus.What dosent help with sending spacecraft up there is the thick clouds that vinus has.and that is is 800 degrees up there also.The auther alos states that the pressuer on venus is 90 times greatee that what we have experience on out plannet.

8177,0,"Yes, facial recognition technology should be allowed to be used in the classroom. I say this because i believe it will benifet more students, make learning more fun and make more people happy. First of all, this new technology will benifet many students in the future. It will help them out by letting them know what emotions they are showing on their face so they can maybe try to fix the bad emotions they don't want anyone else to see. For example, ""Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS has classified all of the facial expressions into 6 basic ones"" Dr. Paul created this whole new FACS system just to clearly understand a person's emotions. Also,by the author using these doctors in the article proves this to be a reliable source. This process of facial scan also works pretty fast because it quickly scans 44 of the major muscles and compares them to each model. this is because of again the FACS system and Dr. Paul has said that he is trying to get it faster everyday and better. This whole facial expression system will make learning so much easier. As the author said in the article, ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This waill help tremendously because some students are afraid or nervous to ask their teachers questions; or even when they're confused they won't have to ask for assistance maybe the teacher changes his/her voice to make the lesson more interesting for those students that are sitting there being bored with the topic that is being taught. Also, ""Then it could be modified the lesson to make it more interesting"" This quote provesw that when at least 1 student says they're bored then most likely a couple of them bored as well. Lastly, this progrem of facial evaluation will eventually make students like school more than they do now; because I;m sure at least every sstudent is bored in at least 1 class per day, imagine if none of that happened anymore. That would all be because of the FACS program. The author says, ""most human communication is done non verbal, including emotional communication."" Therefore, if te computer helps with the communication of our emotions then it will be way easier for many students to enjoy school and have their teachers accomindate them whenever they need it to be done. In conclusion, Having this FACS program in schools will benifet many students, make learning easier and will provide teachers with happier students in their classrooms. So, yes i believe we need this Facial recognition program in th schools because it will eventually someday do incredible things in every classroom around the world."
12852,0,"In a world where driverless cars are becoming more and more of a reality, the worse the option of driverless cars seem. The cars are not driverless, but more like driver assisted. Laws would have to be put in place or drastically changed to allow these cars on the road. Finding out who the problem of the accident when one happens would be a catastropy for the police and insurance agencies. Accidents caused by distractions would be wide spread. In this entire article the fact that the ""self driving"" cars are not self driving is very present. There are some cars that need the passenger of the car to pay attention to the road more than others. This attentiveness that is required defeats the purpose of driverless cars. Some cars required more interaction than others. The BMW ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" requires the driver to constantly hold on to the steering wheel. In the acticle it even states that the cars cannot get themselves through sticky situation such as work zones or accidents. Other cars such as the Google car that use radar and sensors to replicate the car's surroundings are reliable on how the driver drove, and might be prone to malfunction causing accidents to happen. Once the boredom of not driving your car for the full time takes you away from the road you can become distracted. One BMW car even offers a built-in entertainment system that would distract the driver. Everyone has seem what happens when drivers become distracted now with the effects of texting and driving, imagine what would happen if the driver totally didn't have their eyes on the road. Whenever that replication fails or the driver gets distracted, the car would crash, and there would be a huge legal mess. Police officers and insurance agencies would be deamed the task of trying to find whose fault the accident is. Laws would be put in place after months if not years of debates on how these laws should work, and who to blame. This would take the attention away from more important topics that may need fixed sooner than later. The ""self driving"" car debate is a prime example of ""don't fix it if it isn't broke"". As evident in this article the cons heavily out-weigh the few pros that can be observed. The social and economic change on our world would be one that could impact everyone for the negative, as stocks would fall, tax dollars would be wasted, and car prices would majorly increase. ""Self-driving"" cars should be left as they are seem in the past, a figure of our imagination, that would only be in place in utopian societies."

In the text it states "" On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" That can not be good for the human body. Venus has a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide blankets and sulfuric acid clouds. Also, in the text it states ""such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" I don't know how good of idea this could be because according to the passage ""...no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades."" Now just imagine what it would do to a human without the proper gear on. Than, again they might think it's a good idea to see if their is ife outside of Earth. This could possibly happen in the near future. I don't think the scientists or the author care about the danger that could possibly happen. In the text it states "" Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. In conclusion, studying Venus is a huge risk. It could possibly take years or decades until a decision is made, or until the proper equipment is invented. Either way studying Venus has its cons and pros."
20985,0,"A time without cars would be a very interesting idea, but now that almost everyone has a car some people think that it would be hard to seperate from them. So instead of completely sepereateing from them lets try to limit thier usage. Think of all the benifits not just for you for everyone. Most cars pollute the air we breath, things would be different because think of all the money you could save by not having to buy gas or another car, and also think of how lazy cars have made people today cities would improve if people just walked instead of driving to and from work. We all know how unhealthy cars can be to the envirorment, but did you know it could get so bad it could really hurt people. according to Robert duffer paris had to place a ban on half of the cars because they had so much smog in thier city. ""On monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine"" (Robert Duffer). he also said that diesel fuel was blamed and that it is worse than the normal gasoline. once a majority of the people had stayed off the roads for a while the smog eventually cleared up. So once agian this shows how harmful cars can be to an enviroment. The reason america is having a drop in driven miles in the past years is that with the unemployment rate high and most americans can't afford cars. the article by Elisabeth Rosenthal has showed that since 2005 the number of miles driven has decreased and that the explanation of the recesssion is because of ""cash-strapped americans could not afford new cars"" (Elisabeth Rosenthal). Another statistic from the passage was that ""the rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three yeas before the downturn""(Elisabeth Rosenthal). Even most middle class people have working cars some struggle to pay thier car payments and with the cost of gas high too they could really have a hard time. Many people belive that the car is one of the main reasons that people today are as lazy as they are. just think if their were no cars everyone would get exersize by walking too and from work or the store. In Bogota Columbia parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city. Just because they have something called a car free day this major event has inspired new bike paths and sidewalks throughout the city. and that was only a day out of the year and most of the people gladly participated. this was the third straight year of this event but it still goes on even when the rain is coming down people still want to be apart of events without cars. Unfortunatly most people would only see the bad side of things if anyone tried to completley get rid of cars forever. But there are always a good side of things with anything including the car. The problems of polution, the expenses of the things you need to have to keep a car running or with you, and the fact that it help stop the laziness of some countrys and help make them look new."

Also, there is no reason NASA would have for trying to hide something so major from the world. Lastly, if their was aliens on mars, wouldn't their be more evidence supporting the aliens instead of nothing? Garvin from Mars Global Surveyor, talks about how it reminds him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho as stated in paragraph 12. Anyone could go to Middle Butte in Snake River Plain of Idaho and see for themselves if they look alike. A simple way to put it is that their are so many things this ""face"" could've been other than aliens. Which is why most people don't believe in this ""theory"" because it is far from practical. Although NASA could hide what they saw at Mars, why would they? There is no reason for NASA to keep anything they discover a secret, or try and hide anything from us. NASA wouldn't have even shared the photo if they felt that they didn't want for anyone to know, to stir up this controversy in the first place! The astronauts were most likely just as shocked as we were when they saw the image. Lastly, there isn't enough evidence to infer that there is any type of life form on Mars. In paragraph 9 of the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" it talks about how it isn't easy to target where the face is. If the face was a form of life there would be more, and it probably wouldn't be so hard to find. Most likely there wouldn't be one face but many. Even with every fact in the world there are still the great questions we all have from time to time. Even with the facts we all know about. Though I think that there is no possible way there could be any existence on Earth. You could always say ""what if."" Which is why I hope you take my words into accountance when you think about the face on mars."

In Europe in 2006 there government finished construction on a town that had no garages or drive ways, the only place to park was a garage that you had to buy a spot in for $40,000 witch you payed for along with your house. This trend has been growing around the world, and with this trend spreading so is lower pollution in the world."
12906,0,"As new ideas resurface- companies and people begin to attack the possibilities of new innovations. In this case, driverless cars have come into question and have increasingly developed over the years to tackle the possibility of removing human error in driving and in result transform the way transportation works. The article argues that with driving out of mans' responsibility there could be less casualties and less consumption of fuel. However, the development of driverless cars would result to be inefficient and do more hurt to mankind. To place a manmade vehicle able to operate on its own on a road would be a tedious task that wouldn't offer much in return. Furthermore, to make a driverless vehicle operate is simple and possible, as stated in the article, yet what's difficult is getting the technology advanced enough to actually accommodate to real world situations. The article states how the downfall of the vehicle was how it needed a driver to maneuver through heavy traffic and other road obstacles, yet how in the future would a person be able to maneuver through difficult situations without much experience driving as they'd normally be accustomed to the car doing all the work. Therefore, there could be even more havoc expressed on the road with inexperienced people inconfidently driving in tough situations. More so, what if there were an emergency and the driver needed to get somewhere like the hospital quickly yet couldn't because the car wouldn't be able to operate faster than the alotted speed limit? There could be serious consequences there as the driver wouldn't be able to reach their destination in a short time. Also, the whole idea of having people driving cars is so they may control where they are going. What would happen if the driver wanted to change their destination and thus change routes? Would the car be able to recognize this change in task as efficiently as a driver could? Nonetheless, a car functioning solely on technology can be very impractical, unreliable and have possibly a larger margin of error as a normal driver operating a car would. To add, the development in driverless cars would cause further dependability on technology for mankind. There is already much discussion and question as to how advancing technology is affecting society and the way people act today. With the invention of television and cell phones alone created for entertainment and facilitation of communication,the idea of people becoming irresponsible, detached, and more lazy has been brought into the light several times. Imagine how much more television or time not using one's brain would be spent with the new ""in-car entertainment and information systems"". People could become more devoted and rely too much on these entertainment systems to take alert them when extra driving assistance is needed. Furthermore, drivers could overestimate the ability of the driverless cars unassuming the possibility of heavy traffic assistance. Nonetheless, the wandering minds of humans cannot rely of technology to always keep them safe whereas the drivers would have to do so themselves. The driverless cars would be a giant leap for man in terms of technological breakthroughs. However, the actual use of these cars in day-to-day life would prove to be impractical and more of a hassel than a facilitator. The margin of error of humans may be overestimated in comparison to these new technologies and thus it's best to trust humans to decide where and how they want to get places."
5669,0,"I like the idea of having it, it sounds like it would make teaching kids who are sad or depressed easier.Especially if it can change the lesson a little bit spice it up so kids wouldnt be bored.I like the idea because of course im a student and i still get bored in class sometimes so i would really like to see that change. But on the other hand it could see if students are mad or bored but it really couldnt tell what the student is mad at.so the computer could just be switching up the teachinhg style when the student is mad or bored about something totally different.The machine cant read minds it can only read emotions.But would never really know whats going on in the students head. You Have to really explore both sides on this arguement or topic to understand if we need the machine or not. I think we are trying to take less work off the teachers and let the computer help. Although at the same time the most the teachers can do is guess whats wrong with the kid and talk to him.but if we really needed the machine it wouldnt be up to the people it would be up to school board. But my final answer would be that i would choose the teacher over the computer.We just need to teach the teachers to get better at helping us.And actually caring if we are doing work or not,and if we are bored or fustrated at are work.If we had that we wouldnt need a machine to tell us emotions."
15790,0,"""Unmasking the Face on Mars."" is an article that presents information abou the discovery of a landformation that resembles that of a human face. However, due to an extreme lack of information that the landform was created by extraterrestrial organisms, NASA will not deem the face on Mars in the Cydonia area to be nothing but a landform created by forces acting on the surface of Mars. When NASA first discovered the face with the photograph from Viking 1, the controllers at the Jet Propulsion Lab were only amused for a brief moment. ""The sensation was short lived."" in the case that the controllers at the Jet Propulsion Lab where only thrilled, curious about the formation for a short time, and once the reality sunk in, they knew it was nothing more that a rock formation that resembles a human face, with facial features such as ""resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth"" according to the image and caption that NASA published a few days after the discovery. When NASA's Jim Garvin took intrest in the images, NASA decided to take further exploration into the ""Head"" and see what the formation really looked like 12 years after the first images were shot by Viking 1 in 1976. In April, 1998, the ""Mars Global Surveryor"" returned to the site of intrest, the images that the surveryor took showed ""No alien moument"" in the images. The images taken by the surveyor were ""ten times sharper"" than the images taken by the Viking 1 space craft, years after they where taken. The images that where showing a much better detail of the formation on the terrain showed nothing that resembled a head. The formation was nothing more than miscasted shadows on a hill or proped up area on the surface. The images taken show that the face was nothing more than just the rock formation on the land. The formation does resemble a human face but only that due to the shadows being casted that day. When NASA revisited the site, they took an ""extraordinary photo using the cameras absolute maximum resolution."" showed the ""Martin equivelent"" of a ""buttle or mesa"" which are landforms that form on Earth in America's west. Though the pictures that were taken do not show any likness of a human face or an alien monument, those pictures where taken on a cloudy day, with an older camera which could have a margin of error. However, the images taken in 1998 of the landfrom was retaken on April 8th, 2001 on a ""cloudless summer day in Cydonia"" which further proved that the land formation was not indeed a face or a monument. The image taken in 2001 also using the ""absolute maximum resolution"" on the camera of the spacecraft to further asure that they could see every possible detail of the formation. Though the formation on Mars was at one point seen as a face or a ""alien monument"" the formation was further investegated and the results show that the face was just how the light and shadows acted upon the formation. The formation was not deemed to be a face or an extratarestrial civilization, just an oddly taken picture of a natural formation on the surface of Mars."
18528,0,"Humans always want to come up with new ways to make life simpler, wether it be a microwave that runs faster, or even more comfortable running shoes. Those all seem like pretty mundane things compared to what manufactures are developing now. Try to think of a world where cars use half of they use for fuel today, or where nobody has to buy a car because they aren't needed. Thats what manufaturers are trying to do, they are trying to develop cars that do not need drivers, cars that can drive themselves. Since the 1950's people have been trying to develop cars that do not require a driver. Personally I do not agree with the idea of a driverless car. The idea is a good one but it's been in development since the 1950's and they still haven't made a fully functional driverless car. There are people who say the reason why is because we don't have the exact technology to actually create a car the is driverless, yes that is true, but when will they have the technology. Five years from now, twenty years from now, we don't know and whose to say we will ever get that technology. Google anounced that it had cars that could drive on their own, but only on special circumstances. The cars they have developed the driver still has to stay alert for when the car gets into roadwork, or has to drive around an accident. That could pose a danger because what if the driver falls asleep or isn't paying attention to the road. That could pose a threat to both the driver and others well being. Also some manufacturers have been developing a smart road system with dual polarity magnets, the cars would read the polarities and would stay on the road. The issue with that is to create a smart road system would take to much time and effort to put together, which make it very impractical. Instead manufaturers turned to smarter cars instead. They desinged it to have sensors that would mimic the actions of a human, like monitering the road, video cameras mounted near the rearveiw mirror, and a inertial motion sensor. It all sounds very grand, elaborite, and very expensive. In 2013 BMW announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assist"". The car would be able to handle driving functions at a speed of twenty five miles per hour. However, special touch sensors make sure the driver always have their hands on the wheel. I see multiple issuse with the idea of a ""Traffic Jam Assist"", first off the car can only take control of functions at speeds of twenty five miles per hour. Also the driver has to take control if they are to go over twenty five miles per hour. In fact none of the cars that have been developed actually are truly driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake, but the driver still has to take control sometimes. What would happen if the driver got distracted or fell asleep at the wheel? Disaster would follow. There are many perks about driver less cars, less fuel being one of them but there are also many issues I see with the cars developed. Having to have a driver in them ready to take over if nessesary, some states not allowing driverless car test, not having the exact technology needed to make these cars a safe as possible, and not to mention human error that can always occur in driving. I believe that maybe in the future when technology has advance more then maybe diverless cras wouldn't be obsolete. But right now in the era of 2016 driverless cars are not needed. Mainly because we still have driving issuse that need to be solved like people getting distracted by phones, reackless drivers, and cars that aren't built good to begin with. So in the future they might have a purpose but until they can develop a car that is completly safe and has the technology needed to create it, we simply do not need driverless cras."

The people that have to obide by the president should be able too choose who thier president is. I can see where people like the electoral college because the electors get to choose and it has to be a majority of 270 electoral votes. I also don't like the fact that all of the states get a different amount of electoral votes. Claifornia gets the most amount of electoral votes, it gets 55. But there are a few states that only get three or four. All of the states should get an equal amout of votes, We are the 'United' states, arnt we? The idea of the common adult (over the age of 18) being able to vote is a good way to let us keep our say in things, especially if we get to choose who the president is going to be. Once again, I think you should change it to popular vote for the president of the United States."

So as you read you might think there is something living on Mar's but the Face on Mar's is acually is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa---landforms it is common around the American West.

Ms. Breadwill here to do an interview with Mrs. Backbone, because she thinks ""Unmasking the Face in Mars"" was made by aliens. I've did some research and i have all the answers to your questions Mrs. Backbone. Let's Get Started! "" Few scientist believe the Face was an alien artifact and i think they are right"" said Mrs. Backbone. "" Well your certainly not wrong Mrs. Backbone, but cheif Jim Garvin told us "" We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it, plus what about in the years of 1998 and 2001."" replied Ms. Breadwill. I immedeitly showed Mrs. Backbone the photos that were taken in the year of 1998 and in the year of 2001 and she was speechless. Mrs. Backbone had another question for Ms. Breadwill (me). I told Mrs. Backbone to let all the questions she needed to answer be said. Mrs. Backbone told me that The Face on Mars was located at 48 degrees south martain latitude. Ms. Breadwill shook her head and replied "" Your wrong, because the scientists and I studied and found out that The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martain latitude."" Mrs. Backbone was once again speachless and i think i seen her roll her eyes. "" Mrs. Backbone how are you feeling?"" Ms. Breadwill commented. Mrs. Backbone simpliy sighed and said "" Can we move on to the last question?"" Mrs. Backbone had one more question, and i was hoping it wasn't too hard since I have been answering all her questions correctly. Mrs. Backbone said, "" the Face is not a natural landform and I still believe there is an alien monument. I sighed and told her she was wrong once again. She yelled "" How?!"" I simpliy told her On April 5, 1998 when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" I also told her on April 8, 2001-a cloudless summer day in Cydonia-Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look.

23351,0,"Dear Mr. Senator, I'm writing you this letter to discuss that we should keep the Electoral College. I think we should keep it because it's only a fair enough way of voting it is more consistant than others because if we voted by popular vote it wouldn't be much fair because as soon as most people found out there was a black president running they were against it the thought it was the worst idea ever. Instead of giving Mr. Obama the chance he deserved most people were against him. So if it wasn't for the Electoral College Mr. Barck Obama wouldn't have gotten the chance he deserved. Romeney also could've won but that's not the way Electoral College works when voting you are actually voting for a slate of electors and they chose the president. The electoral collage some people might call it unfair or a disaster factor because it's not the people chosing the president it's the electors. The popular vote just chooses which person is more well liked not who people think will make the country a better place and so far no one is doing so. The Electoral college has a slate of trusted electors that has a certain party's nominee and the trust is rarely ever betrayed. Despite the Electoral College's lack of democratic process it's certainty of outcome is good as for example Obama's winning he received 61.7 percent of the elctoral vote compared to 51.3 percent of the popular vote. The Electoral College also should be kept because it prevents Run-Off Elections elections when no canidate receives majority of the votes. This why I think we should keep the Electoral College and not change over to the popular voting method."

He worked on a project with another profesor, Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam, to develop better ways for computers and humans to communicate. They created the new software called, The Facial Action Coding System. This system has made computers interpret the facial expressions of humans, to tell what emotions they have. Dr. Huang believes that FACS technology will improve technology in a classroom. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,..."" Computers would identify the neccessary teaching style needed to effectively teach a student based on their emotions. Computers would understand students' learning styles more than human teachers will. Dr. Huang stated, ""...it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" There would be no need of a teacher in a classroom when computers become intelligent enough to understand exactly what a student needs, based on his/her emotions. Classroom computers in the future will identify more effective ways to understand nonverbal communication better than humans. ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,..."" Computers are already finding better ways to interpret humans' emotions. Just because humans sometimes understand each other effiently, doesn't mean it can't be improved. Dr. Huang noted, ""So computers need to understand that, too"" The only way to understand peoples' emotions better are through the new technologies that are being made through computers. This system has made computers interpret the facial expressions of humans, to tell what emotions they have. This new technology could change the world forever. You would no longer have to ask a person how they are feeling, a computer could easily tell you. Now computers wouldn't allow humans to not have their emotions anymore, but they would detect them easier than we could. In conclusion, FACS's technology is neccessary in classrooms all over the world. No argument could disagree that this new technology is needed in our society today."
15962,0,"Have you ever thought of driving without manually controling a moving vehicle? This is a task that some might argue to be problematic. That driverless vehicles are bad for the environment or that they are unsafe. You might feel inclined to believe them, but you shouldn't. Driverless cars are actually pretty safe, clean, and, with recent technological breakthoughs, affordable. Sound too good to be true? Well it isn't. Google produced a line of semi-automized cars, that is to say that these cars required some manual control for more complex manuevers such as going through roadwork. Now these are not the type of cars I promised, I know, but these semi-auto cars were expected to use less than half the amount of gas than regular automobiles, once they finally have been upgraded to complete autonomy that is. They would also offer individuals more fexibility than taking the public bus or taxi. While that informs you of the effect on the environment, and your personal scheduele, it dose not inform you of their safety. However, I can assure you they are safe. Why? Because when Google did a study of their semi-automated cars, they found that their vehichles had driven almost half a million miles without an accident. Compared to the areas in which traffic accidents are common enough that they dont even make the news I would say this is a huge improvement and a testement to their safety. What if these vehicles had been completely automated? And while many may scoff that the reason why they are not already made that way is because they cannot be made fully automated and self driving, they are wrong. It is not a matter of cannot, it is more a matter of laws. Many laws require a driver to be at the seat of the vehicle to take responsibility in the case of an accident and with selfdriving cars that is all they would be. Accidents would be nothing more than flukes made by a system, but these flukes would not be able to be punished. Therefore, I find that self-driving cars and vehicles would be beneficial to communities and th environment. We would merely need to change and add a few laws this way individuals know who to blame in accidents. Which is why I say that driverless cars are the path to a good and bright future."

If your going to travel by ship Luke found the time to have some fun on board so maybe you can too. The ship will feed you and give you a bed to sleep-in. Luke said``It made me more aware of people of other contries and thier needs``.There are lots of reasons to be a part of this program. Also you have jobs on the ship like cleaning up the ship or getting the food ready for the other people on board to eat. Also on the ship you may run into a storm so the crew will determan how bad the storm is, and if the storm is to bad you will have to go inside till the storm clears. Then when you arive in the country that is in need you do what they need like getting a water suply or getting food for the people or getting the medical care the people need need and if you dont believe me than just ask Luke. Then when you are don with what that contry needs then you can get back in/on the ship or waggon you came on than you can leave and return home and wait for the next country that needs.

People already a lazy now they wont have to do anything. Its not teaching them how to drive, its encouraging people to be under developed. They won't be able to access the real world they'll be spending alot of their time on social media as they do now. Why is it bad to make Driveless Cars? First off who would benifeiting off of driverless car? Yeah the rich would have them but, wouldn't they be more of a threat? How useful would they be? So many questions you know why, its new first of all people like new things, like cars, phones, hunting rifles, etc... we want new inovations to drop and when someone reads a newspaper clip stating "" Google's cofounder invented driveless cars"". The people love that type of things and whats gets them move interested is when you give them details, the new functions, and the accsessability you have in a car that you don't need to drive. Secondly, we can be useing the funds for another purpose. We can buy things for the uneducated or help the homeless so many posibilities we have and we invest it in a driverless car that has no other function other than take you to your location by gps. Finally, the importance of a self diving vehicle isn't needed do to the technology that we have already. We have so much that we use it for transportation. We literally have the whole world in our pocket and we're using it for cars. That's why it isnt a good idea to be making driverless cars."
2470,0,"Venus, one of the most hottest planets in our solar system. In the passage, "" The challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author talks about how he feels about scientists and NASA exploring the hot planet itself. He states why they should and ways they could even try to explore it. The author supported his idea well and this is why. To first start off, the author gave background information about the planet. He described what it looked like, how hot it was, and why it was so hot being that is wasn't the closest planet to the sun. He even compared it to earth being that scientists were trying to see if it could be ""hospitalble"". The author states in paragraph two that venus is often referred to as earth's twin. In the text it says,"" The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" The author includes all this information just about the comparisons between earth and venus putting more detail on his idea. Another reason why the author did a great job was including the ideas of NASA that they made. In paragraph five, the text states how NASA had the idea for sending humans up to venus. The author gave detail on what there ideas were giving us, the reader, insight on not just his ideas but the scientists and NASA as well. The author explains how the conditions where and how scientists planned to go about it. He even talked about how scientist had the thought of floating above the fray of venus's surface.He's giving us information breaking down everyone else's ideas instead of just saying what he thinks then also giving information for both sides. Lastly another reason why the author supported his idea well is that he even states the cons about both ideas and what could go wrong but states how they can be solved. In paragraph six, sentence one, the author states how floating over the planets surface could work but they wouldn't get much out of it. The text states ""peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere."" reading this the author gives his reasoning about what will and will not work. He talks about how if scientists really want to get up close there will be risks but as he says "" we should think of them as challenges."" So to some up, the author and how he supported his idea on ways he thinks exploring venus could work out he explained it well. He included informtion about the planet, he compared it to earth, and gave insight about what will work out and what will not but also how to overcome those challenges. This shows us why the author supported his idea very well just by how well in included information from other sources and giving his reasoning."

These cars would be a great replacement for the manual cars used today. Driverless cars could benefit our society greatly. This new invention of cars without drivers could save many lives. Each year thousands of citizens die, or are injured due to car accidents. These accidents are caused mainly by drivers. If cars continue to need drivers, many more deaths will result from this horrible choice. The drivers of these vehicles could be drunk, driving illegally without a valid license, texting, or distracted, resulting in car crashes. The possibilities as to why a person driving a car could get into an accident are endless! However, with no unsuitable driver at the wheel, roads all over the world will become much safer. If,instead of a driver, the car is automated and drives by itself, people could rid the world of unsafe drivers. With these driverless cars, thousands of lives all over the world could be spared. Driverless cars could save people time. According to paragraph two in the article, Google's driverless cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash. Less crashes would result in less traffic jams. Without traffic jams, citizens would be able to get to their destination quicker and easier. Driverless cars could also save time by not having to constantly run into blocked roads. Due to the driverless cars being automated and controlled by an automated system, the system will most likely be able to detect the quickest route to the preferred destination. Therefore, driverless cars could be an advantage to us by saving us time. With the invention of the driverless car, homo sapiens (humans) would be able to save money. The first product of the driverless car is not bound to be cheap, but as time progresses, the cost of this new car will eventually go down. According to paragraph one in the provided article, the driverless cars would use half the fuel of today's cars and would offer far more flexibility than a bus. Gas is a very expensive fuel. However, if citizens were to only need to pay for half of the money they pay for gas today, then they could save a lot of money that could be used for more important investments. Also, the driverless cars could result in less car crashes, which would result in not having to pay for damage repair. Overall, the driverless cars would not only your save life, but your money too. The driverless cars could benefit our lives. They would be able to not only improve the way people live today, but they would also have the power to save lives, save time, and save money. This new car design could be the exact replacement, for the manual car used today, our society has been looking for. With these cars, students would also be able to focus on their schoolwork more, rather than on passing their driving exam. They could change life as people know it. The driverless cars would fundamentally change the world for the better."

Here are my reasons why it should be in school. Those are reasons in the real world but the question asks if it would be valuable in a classroom. If you can see that a kid is truely upset then you can talk to them before any tragies happen like school shootings and suicides. Also as the story said """"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."""". This pretty much means when robots take over every job, which they are going to do, They could be even better then human teacher seeing if the class needs help on a certain kind of material, they can work harder on it or change the material. Also the Robo-Teachers can try to make the class more funner when every body is sad. I think that that code will make robotic teachers more useful and effective.

Its very dangerous to have a driverless car. Its also careless too, because you are putting more peoples life at risk. If you buy a driverless car, most people will see you as lazy, and it is lazyness. There's no use in driverless cars because you would still have to drive the car if there is complicated traffic or roadwork or accidents. If you are really that lazy not to drive then dont leave the house. The second reason why i dont like driverless cars is because it is more dangerous. You are more likely to get into a car accident because plenty of thing could go wrong. The technology might fail and sterring wheel migh go crazy. You never know what can or will happen. I just think its putting more danger out on the road. The third reason is that it think its care less for someone to get a driverless car becuase they are putting more peoples life at risk when they are on the road. You wont have your hands on the wheel so what if you hit a bump or something and the car goes out of control? You have to be considerate of other too. Overall, I wouldnt suggest on buying a driverless car. Its a accident waiting to happen. If you do have a driverless car, just be carefull and just keep in mind that anything can happen."
17297,0,"A time in the future where no one buys cars because they don't need them is a contradicition waiting to occur. As people believe that driverless cars would change the world for the good, I believe that it would bring more damage. If we can't control the damage on the roads now, what makes companies think that we can control the roads or cars to become smarter? By creating automatic cars we are causing humans to lack any skills and adding even more laziness to the population of people. The required age for a teenager to get his/her permit is fifteen and a half if they take drivers educaiton, making them capable of getting their license at sixteen. If we make driverless cars we are telling young teens that they don thave to make an effort to work for what they want. The ability to drive is a privel age not a given. Would any parent want to send their child out into a world of driving with no experince and let them go anywehre they want? The answer should be no, the parent wouldn't have the knowledge of what exactly a driverless car is capable of, why would the teen? This leads to responsibility. Responsibilty means that one is trustworthy enough to know what they are doing. Driverless cars are an advantage to many people in the wrong way, we want to prevent the amount of crashes that occur with drunk or reckless dirvers. Are they really even being punished? In today's world drunk driver's are being easily spotted, this is not only saving the lives og others but the driver as well. With driverless cars we are telling these people that it is okay for them to drink and ""drive"" without actually driving. We aren't taking into consideration that they still need to be aware if they have to take over the car or not. In my personal opinion driverless cars are not a good idea because they could shut down at any minute and could malfunction. They wouldn't bring anything more than the damage we have now, which is why we should stick to manual driving."
12172,0,"In my point of view on driverless cars is not that much of a good idea. You can never put your whole trust in a car. Its a nice and some what smart but technology can fail once again. So many new laws will come by not just for the driverless cars but also for all kinds of car. My first reason to my opinion on ""Driverless cars"" coming our way is bad. I say that because then the people already having issues with others driving in the streets with and with out drivers license would have more trouble. Also the people driving will have to be more extra careful. Its not such a safe idea because the road is not something to play with. Another reason into why its not a good idea is because no matter how brand new the car is and how expensive the matierials that were used in the car is really nothing. You cant even trust the person driving. Anything at anytime could happen to the car. Its more responsibility for a driverless car. I feel like you need to have experience on a regular car first then own a driverless car. My last reason to why its a bad idea too is because of kids around you in other cars. I feel like there would be actually more accidents coming our way. If you cant handle a wheel on a regurlar car there no point into having advanced experince into something more different. Laws will make a change soon and more cops around us. None of that is worth it if we had more good drivers and none lazy people around us. Those are my reasons to why I feel like there should not be nomore technical things especially on cars. To me thats really dumb and unnessisary. This is only my opinion. Maybe to the kids growing up with everything will think its a good idea because it seems easier. As I grow up I see how people invent things that are not even worth to be in this world. Causes more accidents in the streets then there already is. Then again its only my opinion. Do you think its a smart idea of having ""Driverless cars""?"
17857,0,"The new age of technology demands something refreshing and new every day,with new cellular phones coming out nearly every six months, such things are expected. However people who enjoy driving as a sport or even a pasttime are not going to be able to enjoy such things with cars that can drive themselves and the inevitability that roads will be a collective of such things. If they can make special roads; like how General Motors created a concept car that could run on track charged with an electrical cable, there should be an on/off switch for this kind of driving as well as things that are restricted to human drivers only. These things will create a kind of harmony between the two groups of people. However if this alternitive can't be met then self-driving cars should be eradicated as an idea until it is completely safe. To many dangers are posed if we mix the kinds of cars anyway,all it takes is one person to create a wreck, And such things should be avoided at any chance given. Nobody needs to danger more lives than humans do on the highway. We could always put money into better things. The joy of driving is to great for alot of people to give up driving on a daily basis. Our future isn't looking so bright except for the flourescent lights from the robots who are now part of our daily lives."
1087,0,"Venus is the second planet from our sun. Venus is also the most like Earth. We know little about this plannet. One thing is for sure we do know is, it is dangerous. Is Venus worthy of pursuit even though it is dangerous? The author of the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" propposes it is a fantastic idea. The dangers are a small risk to take to gain more information about this planet. The author states all of the following reasons to support his point. Venus is the most Earth-like planet, this may mean that the planet could support other life forms. It is the closest in size and in some cases distance to Earth. Venus has shown to have earthquakes, erupting volcanoes and lighting. These are all things that happen on earth as well and no other known planet. Venus probably had large bodies of water at some point as well, making it able to support life forms of some sort. The structure of Venus is made up of rock, valleys, mountains and craters. Earth and Venus have multiple simalarities. There are also many dangers to visiting Venus. The atmosphere is made up of 97 percent carbon dioxide and has great amounts of highky corrosie sulfur acid from clouds. The pressure on Venus is 90 times greater than Earth. A huge danger is the temperature of the planet. Venus can get to over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. All of these things are a hazard to life. The author of the article states all the pros and cons, but also states the knowledge that would be gained. As the phrase goes knowledge is power. The Information gained from pursuing Venus would be a huge advancement in history."

You should join because you can help them fight and you get go on trips and have a really fun adventure.

He played baseball and volleyball in the empty holes where animals had been housed. They played Table tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing reading,whittling, and games also helped pass the time. For Luke it was more than an adventure. It opened up the world to him. ''I'm grateful for the opportunity,'' he says. ''It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.''

13628,0,"So you think the face on mars was created by aliens? I dont think it was created by aliens, I think it was created by Natural Fomation. First of all, It was a huge rock formation. Then, the eyes, nose, and the mouth were formed by shadows giving them their illusion. Last, there was no alien monument after all. The reason that I think that it was a huge rock formation is because mars has a lot of huge rocks on they're planet. Then, this couldve happened how all the mountains wrer formed on Earth. Ater that, the picture that was taken in 1976 looks like a mountain thats on Earth except for the eyes, nose, and the mouth thats on this Face. Further more, It has many different bumps on it like a huge rock, No rock has the same bumps on it. Finally, big rocks have the same shapoe of the picture tooken in 2001. The nose, eyes, and the mouth were formed by shodows because the sun also hits mars like it hits the Earth. Since the sun hits mars it hits the face and the sun shines directly in to the eyes, mouth, and nose to either make them sink to make it look lke a human face. Shadows can make the face look more realistic because it gives it more of a darker color. Finally, the shadows cause the eyes, mouth, and the nose to get bigger so that we can see it more clearer. There was no alien monument in the area either. If the aliens would've made this face why wouldn't they not have made a monument about they're selves so that they could show off they're selves for us to know that they are real. The aliens could've done it so that we dont keep on searching for them and let us know that they're real. So there for I dont think that the aliens could have made the face on that planet. Im not sure if it was aliens or if it was formed by natural landform. I Think that there is more of a posibility of it being a natural landform than it being formed by aliens. Plus if there was aliens i dont think that they would've done it so that it would be a harder discovery for Earth to find them. Finally I am sure that nature made this face on the planet Mars."
1212,0,"Here I will be telling you how the author supports the idea of studying Venus and the dangers it may come with. I will provide texual evidence from this article to back up my point of view as well. So how well does the author suggest studying Venus despite its dangers? The author seems to be quite adimit about supporting ideas about going to Venus through using word choice that is postive through out this article, ""(NASA) has one particularly compelling indea."" The author also goes on to state, "" Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" This goes to show the author is all for further exploration of Venus. The author talks about the possible amazing outcome of studying our sister planet. This passage also tells about the extremly harsh landscape. Things such as including how hot the surface may get and also the pressure of the atmosphere being a danger. But also within this article it is mentioned about familiar features such as valles, mountains, and craters. With visiting Venus and seeing these sights that are indeed similar to that of Earth's we may learn more about our own planet. So that is a pretty good reasoning for why the aurthor supports going to Venus. Learning about our own planet from another planet is like killing two birds with one stone."
23890,0,"Presidential elections have always been decided by electoral votes. The elections today should be voted on using popular votes. All though electoral votes keeps the amount of work tallying up votes down; popular votes will give you a more accurate percentage of votes each candidate recieves. Initially, when you use popular votes to decide a victor, there will be a more accurate percentage or number of votes per candidate. Popular votes are counted by each individual voter. This allows a more accurate voting scale to be used, since there is an exact number of voters. Electoral votes are based on a state's population and each region in the state is assigned a democratic elector. This only accounts for the majority of the population's votes, which means some voters' votes are irrevelant if the majority voted for an opposing candidate. Additionally, counting popular votes, while time consuming, is worth the effort. Popular votes, when used, are to make sure that everybody is accounted for in the poll. More people would probably vote if they knew that their vote actually matters. When popular votes are used it may take a longer time to tally all of those up than it would for electoral votes, it shows exactly how many people are actually voting. This will let the government know how many votes they should expect to see on each poll. In summation, popular votes, though time consuming, are a better way of electing a new president; instead of electoral votes. Electoral votes are an easier and faster means of counting votes but, popular votes show and acount for everybody that contributes to the poll and/or election. Using popular votes will most likely make more people want to vote, since they can see the amount of voters instead of the number of regions through out the country."
20759,0,"Dear Mr. Senator, Today I am asking for your favor of keepig the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. This process now consists of the selection of the electors and meeting where they vote for the president and vice president, and the counting of votes by the congress. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors, but only 270 of those votes are required to elect the president. I think that we should change the way that our citizens vote. I also think that we should update how the elections are run. First of all, we should change the way that our citizens vote. When we vote for a president we are actually just voting for that Elector. So there is a possibility that the Elector could vote for the opposite president and your vote basically not be put in. I think that our citizens should have enough rights that they dont have to have Elector to do the voting for them and we can all just vote for who we want. For instance, it could be just all politics and the Electors get paid to vote for a certain person and thats why most of the presidents who get elected get elected today. Secondly, We should update how the voting system works. Instead of it being 270 people out of 538, we should just have everyone one vote without Electors. Then everyone would have there say in the voting system and then they could just average it out or figure out the math of who won by percentage. For instance, take the number of all the people who voted for both presidents and take the number of one of the presidents and divide them by eachother and multiply it times 100. Then all the political stuff wouldnt happen because everyones vote counted. Maybe a change in the system would be a good idea. Last but not least, In The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong, Bradford said that in 1960 segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. So that vote would not have actually gone to Kennedy. So the Electors are not as reliable as everyone thought. Some Electors have also refused to to vote for there parties canidate. My honest opinion is to just change the Electoral College. In conclusion, I am writting to you Mr. Senator in hopes that you can fix the Electoral College and change the election to a popular vote. If this were to happen, it could make our citizens have a little more rights. We may also update our system a little bit so that the election voting is a little more accurate so that everyone gets to get there vote in. Maybe this could be what solves most of the political problems in the world. Sincerly, PROPER_NAME"
6730,0,"The use of the Facial Action Coding System that is used to read emotional expressions of students in classrooms is valuable. The use of this technology is valuable because students would have a better work ethic. The students would want to strive and would want to do their work. This technology could help make a better work ethic in students because the computer would know how to keep their attention. For example, say that a student is doing a work activity on the computer but starts lacking interest in the activity. The computer could read the students emotional expressions and make the activity more interesting, like using more colors, or even adding more to the activity that is fun. The computer could do something that excited the student or even made the student want more of something, such as information about a topic they read about. In the article, the author states that the professor, Dr. Huang, tested the emotion software on the famous Mona Lisa painting. The software collected data that Mona Lisa was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. With that information being collected from this software I believe that its use could be valuable with classroom computers. The teachers would value the work of the software to know how to help the students when the lack work ethic and to know how to keep the childs attention to the work. This software could even help the teachers work ethic by getting to know how their students learn. The Facial Action Coding System could be the future to a new software in all computers when it comes to all types of schooling systems, no matter if its medical school or even high school. The way that the software calculates emotions is very interesting to me. This software was a great project to complete. In my opinion, this could be very valuable to schools all over. This could also be valuable to the students and teachers using it to work. Its amazing how a software program can track facial movements to decet emotions. The software uses video imagery, which then tracks the facial movements of a person, which then detects the emotions of the person. This somewhat mimics the way that humans can detect emotions. For example, say you were with a friend but you could tell that something was wrong with them. You knew this by their facial expression, which is how the software also works."
16205,0,"This is Dianee and she is going to eplain to you why the ""face"" was not created by aliens. It all started in 1976 when Viking 1 took a photo of the ""face"". The face was located in Cydonia it is two miles long from end to end. It looked like a face of an Egyptian Pharaoh. It is actually a mesa. Then,in 1998 the MOC wanted to take another picture because many people were saying that it was created by aliens. This picture would be in movies,books,magazines,radio talk shows and even in grocery stores for twenty five years. When NASA let the public see this picture they believed it was created by aliens. We went back in 1998 and took some more pictures and it had still looked like a face but it was not. My people said that we (NASA) would rather hide then say that there was life on Mars, many conspiracy theorists were saying. We wouldn't hide we would tell the public so that we could get more money to be able to go to Mars and see these aliens. What some people wanted was aliens and other people didn't. Mostly all the scientists at NASA including myself did not believe that the""face"" was created by aliens. So in 2001 we went again to Mars to get a picture of the ""face"". It would be a clearer picture because the cameras were ten times better than the cameras in 1976 and in 1998. It was very hard to get to that exact spot on Mars. The face on Mars was 41 degrees north martian latitude. On April 8,2001 it was summer in Cydonia when we had taken the picture in 1998 it was winter and it was very cloudy. The camera was 1.56 meters per pixel in 1976 it was 43 meters per pixel. So if there was objects on Mars like a plane of a pyramid we would know because we would be able to see it. We said that it was either a butte or a mesa. They are commom in the American West. It's kinda like the Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho. They are basically lava domes but the one on Mars had looked like a face becasuse of the shadows. So,in conclusion the ""face"" is not created by aliens based on these facts."
11641,0,"""The Face on Mars"" On May 24 2001, a NASA spacecraft discovered a shadow in the shape of a human face. Some scientist believed that the face was caused by aliens, but many others believed that it was just a natural landform. Mesa's and butte's are two types of natural landforms. They are very common around Cydonia. Around May, NASA put the image on the interenet for everyone to view. The caption of the picture said it was a huge rock with the ILLUSION of a face. An illusion is a when someone plays a trick on your eyes,this means it could look like a face but be an mesa. The way a person sees something is based on their own perspective. If one scientist sees a alien shape,another person sees a human face,and the other see a rock it is based on their point of view. The picture caught alot of attention even by the chief scientist of NASA""s Mars Exploration Program,Jim Gavin. Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team came to take pictures of Mars. The used a camera that had better quality than the Viking spacecraft. MOC's picture proved that the Face was only a natural landform. There were people who still thought it was analien so they took another picture. They used a camera that would make the image 3 times its pixel size, this means that if their was anything or size you would see is. In the end,pictures proved that the Face shaped like a human's turned out to be just a butte or a mesa which was common. Many people are disappointed, but scientist have proven thier theory of ancient civilization on the Red Planet is incorrect. The Face still remains on the planet Mars. There are still many parts of the world that are yet to be discovered. Who knows what is out there?"

You forgot to call your dad even though its his 78th birthday. You get in you car, take a deep breath, and you sit back and relax as you're driven to work. How is this possible? With a Driverless car. Driverless cars are the future. Driverless cars allow you to relax, work on other things, and it can provide safer transportation. Driverless cars are what we need to be focusing on developing for the future. You've had a long day at work and you just don't have the energy to drive home. With the driverless car, you can just put in your adress and you'll be driven home like you're in a taxi. Driverless cars can provide more efficent means of transportation. Instead of taking a taxi to work and having to pay, you can just be driven there by your own car. You have a test first period and you forgot to do that study guide that virtually gives you the answers to the test. The only problem is: You have to drive. With the driverless car you can study for that test or get that report done for work. It allows the driver, or should i say passenger, to work on other things, but also requires the person to pay attention. Although the car is smart, it's not smart enough to do everything you can! You went out with some friends and you had some fun. Walking to your car is a bad idea and driving is an even worse one. You don't have any money left from a night out on the town, and you don't want to get in a crash with your car. Thats where driverless cars come in. You're a little tipsy, you don't trust your friend to drive you home so you put in your adress to the GPS and you're home safe and sound. Driverless cars are the future. These cars can reduce the amount of drunk driving accidents, reduce stress on people not having a great day, and it can allow you to relax and enjoy the ride home. A driverless car is the future.

22939,0,"Dear senator, I believe that the electoral college should be dissolved and replaced with election by popular vote. The electoral college is a flawed system that has resulted in several unfair elections such as the 2000 election in which Al Gore won by popular vote, but lost the election because Bush had a majority of the votes from the electoral college. Also the members of the electoral college are not obligated to vote for the candidate chosen by the people but could willingly vote for the candidate of their choice. Also, ""Most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate"" this system could greatly off set the election. ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president,"" this system goes completely against the constitution in that ""We the People"" don't elect our own president. I thoroughly believe that we should move on to election by popular vote, because there would be less problems with the presidential election."
19510,0,"I think that driverless cars would be really cool to be droven around in. But honeslty I honestly think they would require alot of responsibility and care. Also that they should be able to take any person to their destination as needed. Another thing, wouldnt they cost a fortune? I am going to list some of my reasons and thoughts on why they should or should not be good for the world.First reason would be that if I wanted to buy a driverless car by google it would have to be completely hands free. For example the only thing that i have to do is just get in, fill it with gas and it should take it from there. I dont want to have to take the wheel and back up with caution as it stated in the passage. My second reason would be that the car is most likely going to cost a fortune. Like im not going to pay for something that cost a fortune and it not work. I would have to see it work myself and it be proven to me that their would be no problems. Therefore if its proven to me, I would be glad to by it in a heart beat. My final reason would be destination. The car should be able to travel anywhere and everywhere i want to go. For example if I wanted to go from indiana all the way to New York it should get there without any problems. Plus if its got a computer built in it should be able to get there without taking me to the wrong place. As you can see ive stated all my reasons that would have to be done for me or another individual to buy it. But their could be plenty of more reasons that can come from other individuals besides me. Therefore like I said if all those things could be done, I would gladly be a customer of buying it."
21784,0,"Transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions (Rosenthal 34). Global warming is becoming more of an issue as time goes on, part of this problem is vehicles and their pollution they let off. People are getting more and more worried about this as temperatures continue to rise on Earth. They are trying to do something about it. One of the more popular suggestions to help solve the issue is to limit car usage. I know, it seems pretty bizare due to the fact that some towns, such as my own, do not have everything citizens need within a walking distance. Benefically, ""stores are being placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.(Rosenthal 6)"". It is thought that it will ""drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes...Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some areas of the United States (Rosenthal 5)"". People also are not putting forth an effort to help decrease the pollution by buying hybrids, instead they buy Diesels. Diesel gas has more pollutants then regular gasoline. Safety is another reason to reduce car usage. Think about it, if pedestrians reduced their car usage by 50 percent the percentage of car accidents would also decrease. This could save many people's lives; animals as well. Rosenthal said, ""Cities could become denser, and better for walking"", which also makes it safer. To go along with saving lives lets mention health. Americans are getting more and more unhealthy and overweight. It is a rising problem in our country. Many people die from it everyday; obesity can be stopped. One way to lose weight and get in shape is exercise. Imagine how much better shape Americans would be in if we actually had to walk to the grocery store or McDonald's. It would make us think ""do we really need that?"". Those extra burned calories count, sitting in a car does not burn many calories. Traffic jams are aggravating to most people, with the decreasing number of car owners time is being saved. There is less traffic. Andrew Selsky studied car-free day in Bogota, and he stated ""rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic"", this means time is being saved and people are getting to their destinations faster. Another idea was said by Carlos Arturo Plaza ""it's a good opprotunity to take away stress...(Selsky 24)"". Congestion stresses everyone out, whether running on time, running late or just taking a leisurely drive. It makes everyone stress. Congestion actually decreased 60 percent in Paris (Duffer 14). Heidrun Walter also said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Limiting car usage helps a number of problems throughout the globe, such as to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, improve safety, and even improve your health (Rosenthal 43). You may wonder what other ways are there for you transport to the places you need to go. You could walk, jog, hike, bike, skate, or take public transportation. There are so many options and you have the opprotunity to meet new people and exercise if you're having a busy day. America should try it out just for a day and see what it leads to."

19083,0,"Driverless cars, the future of the world. There could be many disadvanteges with driverless cars. One disadvantage would be that there could be malfunctions within the hardware inside of the vehicle. Another would be if someone would hack into the mainframe of the car and take control of it without the owner or driver knowing about it. One last disadvantage would be based upon the driver of the car. My position on driverless cars is that I'm really not a big fan of the idea so I don't really aprove of it The first disadvantage would be if the hardware in the car was to malfunction. Say if the technology in the car was damaged and the car started to not act properly. That would probably cost thousands of dollars to repair. Also if the car was to not function correctly the driver, passengers, or other people outside of the vehicle may be injured. That is the first disadvantage of the driverless car. The next diadvantege would be if someone had hacked into the the cars mainframe. If someone was able to hack into the car without the driver or owner knowing it can be very dangerous. It can be dangerous because they can track where that person is at alll times. They could tell if they're home or not and the owner can possibly end being robbed. Another way it would be dangerous is that the person that had hacked the car could control the car and may end up hurting the driver or people around the car. The last disadvantage would be the driver of the car. If the driver of the car was reckless and irresponsible it can affect him/her or even the people around them. Like in the article it says,""The car can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but are alll designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills."" If the driver was to ignpre that notification it cause an accident and many people may be injured. So like I said, my opinion on driverless cars is that they shouldn't be made and used in public. There are many disadvantages of self driving cars, but I only chose three. The first one was hardware malfunctions. The second was if the car was to be hacked. The last one was all depending on the driver it's self. That is my position on driverless cars."
23562,0,"Cars have been the main focus of developement for many years now. Engineers attempt to create sufficient cars every time a new model is planned. Many citizens of the United States are slightly aware of the environmental damage that is caused by the cars, yet still do no think twice when it comes to driving anywhere. Many countries around the world have set fines and laws against using cars and have seemed to produce a positive outcome. These countries offer many different alternatives to using cars, creating a well developed society. While cars are a huge advantage to modern day society, they take a big toll on our environment. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal, from the New York Times Company, cars are the ""second largest source of America's emission"" proving how much we rely on cars (source 4 paragraph 34).She also writes about numbers terrifying to the future generations. United States is responsible for 50 percent greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes while Europe is only responsible for 12(source 1 paragraph 5). 50 percent is proof that Americans are too reliable on transportation sources like streets, main roads, and highways. Paris was able to clear the air from pollution. According to Robert Duffer from the Chicago Tribune,after enforcing a driving ban, the air cleared after an almost record setting pollution fog (source 2 paragraph 10). Places in Asia like Beijing, China are just filled with smog in the air. The citizens walk around with masks because of the heavy pollution. That is physically dangerous for not only the adults, but the children of the communities. There has to be some alternatives to using cars in excess. Almost anything can be an advantage but when it is used too much, it will always be dangerous. Even though cars are important to commerce within society, many alternatives can be taken to help lower the usage of cars. In places like the capital of Columbia, they have found a way to travel places and limit the car use. Andrew Selsky, from the Seattle Times, speaks of this matter. He claims that there has been ""construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths"" in the city of Bogota (source 3 paragraph 27). Not only does this allow the citizens to be environmentally friendly, but it gives them a chance to exercise, which leads to better health. It is noticable the the healthier people tend to be more lifting than the sluggish, corpulent citizens. In Barcelona, Spain, being a vehicle owner is simple undesired. Other means of transportation like walking or bycycling have been the desired means of getting places. Even Bill Ford, the chairman of Ford Motor Company, admits to the impractical use of cars in excess. There are some many different ways the we can reduce the use of Cars in the American nation. With the ability of using bikes to arrive at destinations, many places have seen the improvements in reduced traffic jams. What Americans hate the most are traffic jams. Think about those times when 10 minutes have slipped away in the morning and you are running late then there is a traffic jam. Millions in Columbia participated in hiking or biking and it left the street nearly empty (source 3 paragraph 20). The citizens were smart enough to recognize when they need a car. When going to work that is only 5 miles away, they take the extra time to reduce the usage of the streets. France experienced the same result, reducing traffic congestion by 60 percent, and then lowering the smog that had covered them (source 2 paragraph 14). This leaves the street safer for drivers and pedestrians. It also reduces the heavy noise from motored vehicles. Many nations have improved their societies by reducing the use of cars. In result, the air pollution is reduced, the health benefits improve, and the traffic congestion is heavily reduced. Not only can reducing our relience on cars benefit our genertaion, but it can benefit the generations to come."
23287,0,in german suburbs residents are pioneers and they have given up thier cars to stop all the busy crowded parking. even though owning a car is aloud they still dont do it because it is safer for the children and enviroment. they are also trying to put a message put to the world. more than 70 percent of the vaubans famileis do not have cars. the cars in europe cause a fair percentage of the greenn house gases. passanger cars alone cause 12 perecent of the gases alone. and up to 50 perecent in some car-instensive places in the us. it is better for the inviroment for there tho be less gas emmisions. in some places such as paris there is so much gasx emisionds that they have banned all driving. the reason being is there is so much smog from vehicals its not healthy to live in or nothing. In bogota columbia there is a all day car free day. this means the goal for everyone is to do not use a motorized vehicle all day and violtors will be fined 25 dollor fines if they us a vehicles. the hope for that program is to go world wide or to atleast spread to more coumtries. What the goal is for this passage is to get everyone to go without cars and just use bicycles or walk or somthing along those lines.
20948,0,"There are few people who can can imagine living a full life in this generation without thewse glorified metal boxes with wheels attached to them; even fewer set living a life similar to that as a goal. The advantages of limiting the amount of cars being used are suprisingly unique due to the dwindling amount of disadvanteges there are. Some of these advantages include reduction in greeenhouse gas emissions and that there will be a reduction in smog. It is always nice to see humanity band together, willingly or forcefully, to work for a common good. Let us begin with the most pressing issue: preserving the environment. Studies have shown that nearly ""12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States."" come from passenger cars (Rosenthal 1, 5). Reducing these greenhouse gases, which pose a threat to the Earth's atmosphere, would be an improvement, although slow, still an improvement nonetheless. While this would not be the immmediately noticable of changes, making an effort to cleanse our cities of pollution would be. Moving on, some places have taken this matter into their own hands, matters that some would describe as extreme. Paris, France is one of these examples, ""enforcing a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city...motorists...ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine..."" (Duffer, 10-11).It is pleasant to see a city taking this matter into their own hands. This ban, though, did spark an uproar on the Internet, but it did die down. Many approaches to cleansing city-air have been drastic, but others such as in Columbia, had some sort of event where ""the goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog."" (Selsky, 21). This did allow a public freedom, despite there still being a fine in place. The remarkable fact of this is that even though cars are being banned, a large portion of the targeted population actuallly do not mind the change, even ""'the rain hasn't stopped people from participating'""(Selsky, 23). Suprisingly enough, this car-ban revolution is still going on today. Many more people are starting to realize the benefits to the ban. Elisabeth Rosenthal, in her article ""The End of Car Culture"" even adds in that many ""sociologists believe...it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment..."". This simply furthers the ideal that humanity as a whole CAN see a chance to change, wants to desperately do so, and WILL do so...eventually."
17158,0,"Why would any one want a computor or robot driving instead of themselves or another human? I find my self saying that when I finished and during the passage I was reading. I have not been driving that long for I am only a teenager so I do not have as much experiance as most adults. But my opinion matters aswell. Maybe a elderly person will like these cars because they cant see or focus like they use too before. Or a soccer mom with to many kids to keep her attention on the road would love to have this. I can understand how some people may want self driven ""smart"" cars. But how ""smart"" are they really. Can they realize there is and accident up ahead at the next light. Or can they see the face expression on a person that just ants to do harm to another person or motor car. Computers can be very smart and very helpful for lots of things in our everyday lives, but driving should not be one of them. I can understand assisting us at driver but do you really trust a computer or robot that could malfunction while it has your life in its metaphorical hands? The sensors may say the light is green but that doesnt mean somone may not run the red light and t-bone your car. As a human you may or should have a better chance at detecting things like that. Humans understand other humans and there emotions better than anything. What are you going to do if your qoute on qoute smart car drives into oncoming traffic and your just sitting there helpless. On the contrary though i do understand how computors or smart cars can improve the saftey (which is the main concern) of driving on the road. Not all people are the perfect drivers who keep their eyes on the road and pay attention 100% of the time. Most people are not. Everyone has interests and dislikes and when you see somthing you like or dislike while driving you may get distracted. The awesome thig about the smart cars is that they will not have any dislikes and thier onle like will be your safety. Would having automatted cars eliinate human drivers all together? I love to drive and personally there is nothing like it. There is no movie or video game that can truely mimick the experiance of driving.It helps young people mature and relize the true responsibility of driving. It is true not all people take to driving like this and some people altogether hate driving. But if it took driving out all together it would take away a great life lession that driving teaches and instills in younger people. Whether you are for or against smart non-human driving cars we can all agree they need a lot of development still. Even then they will always need bugs to be fixed. There is no such thing as the perfect machine. Maybe they will never know there was a problem with a certin part tht indangers the passenger but they never know it till its to late and there already bieng used. They will need a lott of testing and after that even more testing to make these smart cars actually smart. As people always say there is always room for improvment in everything you do and build."
15938,0,"Driverless cars are cars that can opperate and drive on roads wihtought a human accelerating, decelerating, and steering the car. Personally I am both for, and against driverless cars. Just like everything in this world, there are positives and negatives to them. Driverless cars can make it easier on people in their everyday life, but they could also be dangerous to pedestrians or others around the driverless cars. I will now tell you my opinion on driverless cars giving facts to support why I think so. Starting with the postives, driverless cars can make life easier for everyday drivers. It could potentially reduce the percentage of texting and driving becuase the human is not really the one driving, and operating the vehical needing to give their full attention to the road. When the car is driving it's self, it is more aware of what's around it because it can see and sense the whole car without any blind spots, but this is not including work zones or other special road conditions of course. Also, it may be able to reduce speeding tickets and reckless driving. Although there are many benefits to driverless cars, are they really safe? There actually isn't one car in the world today that is completely driverless. All of them need some type of human assistance, if it means backing out of the drive way, getting through a road constuction, or making it through a tricky road. We all know technology is advancing everyday by the second, but with that being said technology fails all the time. There could be a glitch with the system, or it could just completely crash and we would be relying on the car to continue to drive its self. Doesn't sound very safe in my opinion. With smarter cars comes smarter roads? Some companies such as General Motors has led themselves to belive if you update roads, putting some type of magnet, or metal device in them to sensor to the cars, they will have no problem driving on roads. Although, that sounds brilliant would it really work? General motors made a smart track, embedding electrical cables to radio signal negative and positive energy to the front end of the car. It was very succesful, but not every road is as smooth runnng as the track was. Say a company figured out how to create a driverless car, and humans weren't really needed to opperate it, only if something was going wrong, would the laws change? I belive every person who is going to be driving one would need a special license, and they would need to go to a class to learn proper techniques of what to do, and how to react if the car started loosing control and something was going wrong. There is also big contraversy on who would be at fault if the car did have technical issuses and ended up injuring or killing somebody, the cra manufacturer or the individual behind the wheel. Althoug, theres are positives that are really cool, and exciting about driverless cars, they are dangerous and would change so much about the law, and driving on roads. I personally don't see driverless cars becoming a thing on the roads any time soon."
8433,0,"There is now a new technological software called the Facial Action Coding System that enables computers to identify human emotions. I personally believe that the use of this technology, to read the emotional expressions of students in the classroom is valuable. There are many details in the passage that support my argument. In paragrapgh 6 of the article, it proclaims, "" "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts."" ""Then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor."" In the real world today, students often begin to get bored during, or simply just very confused on the material they are working on. When students begin to get confused or bored, their engagement in learning declines. To have a technology software that could modify the lesson like a human instructor when students are confused, or bored is very valuable. The text also states, "" To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" When teachers are finished teaching material, they often ask if anyone has any questions. Some students will lie and say they understand the material when they really don't, because they are too embarassed to be critisized if they don't know how to do a certain problem. With this new form of technology, teachers could actually see if everyone is grasping the imformation they are learning,and not just sayig they are when they are not. This is a major advandcemnt in leaing for all students. There are many reasons as to why the use of the Facial Action Coding System, which enables computers to identify human emotions, for stuents in the classrooms is valuable. Students often always have negative attitudes or emotions that affect their productive learning. Having this technological system will help teachers understand how students are feeling, and will better approach students. When teachers correctly know how to approach certain students, the students learning will prosper."
11070,0,"More driverless cars are coming starting in 2016. The fact about driverless cars are starting to be invented more that can either be a good thing or a bad thing. The manufacturer can make any car they want but the thing is how many people would be able to afford the new driverless cars? Making the driverless cars cen be terrible for many reasons, because the car can possibly have a malfunction while driving. And not all driverless cars can do everything they would still need a human for certain things. Some important bad things about a driverless car is that no matter how smart the car is they would still need a human.For certain things like if there's a traffic jam they would need a human to drive for that part. For example the Google cars those aren't to much driverless cars. In the article paragraph 2 gives a great reason why Google cars aren't so driverless. in the article it says "" they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffice issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents."" Another bad thing about driverless cars is that in the process of making them the manufacturers are going to spend a lot of money making the cars. Besides the fact of them spending a huge amount of money on cars it would most likely be best to stick to regular cars.Because either way if something bad happens the car would need a human to take over. Another thing is if the driverless cars was good in marketing each car would have a whole lot of sensors. A good thing about driverless cars is it can probably reduce accidents since most people are alwasy on there cell phone or texting.In paragraph 5 it says "" automakers used speed sensors at the wheels in the creation of antilock brakes."" It also says ""within the 10 years, those sensors had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers."" So basically everything that would be something good is the sensors to reduce the amount of accidents. Also in peragraph 5 it says "" the information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce the power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone."" There are more negative things then positive statements about driverless cars. To most people they would say it's a waste of money because it not only take the fun out of driving it makes it boring. The smart cars can steer,accelerate, and brrake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. The driverless cars have to go through a big process of not breaking the laws and with regular cars that humans can drive doesn't have to go through all that. Driverless cars can be dangerous that's why they are already illegal in California,Nevada,Florida,and the district of Columbia. The driving laws focus more keeping the drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers. and if the technology in the driverless cars were to fail and someone got injured who would they be able to blame? The driver or the manufacturer? The manufacturer would be the one to blame that's why it would be best to stick to regular cars that people can drive on their own."
6067,0,"Using technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom could be valueable. It can help actors learn how to make a smile or frown look real, it can help a teacher figure out if a student needs more help just by scanning his or her face, and it can help us figure out what our friends are realling feeling. First, movies are a big part of our life. It is never fun to go to watch a movie and see that the actors arent good they either look like they dont know what they are doing or they try looking sad and actually look like the happest person on earth. with this technology like the arthour says "" Drama coach, Constantin Stanislavsky, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage"". This shows that even just practicing a fake smile for a movie or for when you are on stage could make the play seem better than it already would be of the actors didnt know how to put on a real smile. Facial action coding system can also be helpful in the class room so when you have a kid on the computer you can see if they are strugging and they need more help or if they are powering through it and need a bit more of a obsticle to go through. like in in the article "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confussed or bored...it could then modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". This could help a teacher out cause they cant always tell of a student is having trouble. they also dont always see the when they are doing their work at home. This is like the teachers second hand man when coming to helping students get the help or challenge they need. Lastly, you may have a friend that you cant tell if they are sad or happy because. The article states "" Most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc"". You never if a friend is putting on a fake smile to keep you from getting down, but thats just hurting them even more so you sometimes have to do things yourself and get them the help they need. In conclusion, I believe that being about to see someones emotion just by scanning their face could be very helpfull to get kids the help they need or the challenge, helping a friend get through a rough time, and making movies better."

It causes an unnecissary complication for voting for who will represent the face of the best country on earth. We the people do not want to get the wrong president to represent the majority of the population. The chances of an indefined out come through electoral college may be low but when it comes down to the presidency nothing should be left to chance. The voters should know how the system of voting for president. They are the ones that deside so they should know how there vote can be used to have the greatest affect. Bradford Plumer states ""voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate...sometimes"". A democracy is when the people deside the destiny of there country. For them not to know what there chosing takes power out of the hands of the people. The Winner-takes-all system is ok when your on the playground as a childs it does not work in the real world. This system creates Swing States. Acording to Richard A. Posner ""method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates to focuse their campaign efforts on the toss-up sates"". This draws attention away from other states. Bradford Plumer explanes that ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen sates didn't see the candidates at all"". He also clames ""puting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in ohio"". This is not right each vote should be just as important as anyother and no state should be the desiding outcome in an election. Chance is a crazy thing. If there is a chance of something happening and it's given time it will happen. A number of weird outcomes can happen with electoral college. One outcome is the posibility of having a tie. Richard A. Posner explains""A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes-538- is an even number"". If a tie happens the represenetives vote for the people and because each state has one vote per electoral college...""55 representatives from california, who represent 35 millon voters."". Second posible out come is the majority vote goes to one canadite and the electoral college goes to the other. For example Bradford Plumer wrote""This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency."" These are just two of the odd outcomes of electoral colleges could cause. Electoral college don't solve problems but creat them. The best way to put it is this...""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are most assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best.""~(Bradford Plumer)~"

GIving us many reason why it's to challenging to go to Venus. There is multiple challenges would have to face in order to be on Venus. One challenge would be the temperature that Venus may reach to which is about 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Which the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. "" These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" Like it said in the passage it is way to extreme for humans to be on Venus because of it's high temperatures. Another challenge you may come across is the weather and other physical behaviors. In the passage for example it said, "" Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes,and frequant lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface."" That would be a tough challenge because you would have to land on Venus and then you would have to be prepared for the behaviors of the planet and its weather. Which you would need some equipment and tools to figure out how to successfully accomplish the challenge and being able to survive. A third challenge you may come across is making the right spacecraft, try to make it a safe trip to Venus, and making a good landing. Just being able to be on the planet for a good amount of time. In the passage it said, ""Because Venus is sometimes right around the corner- in space terms-humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" You have to be able to put a lot of work and close detail to make the spacecraft safe and just having some access to some of the tools or materials that would have to be used for the spacecraft. In general the challenge of exploring Venus is massive. You may find a whole bunch of mini challenges to discover another challenge. It may take a long time, dedication, and effort to explore Venus but it may just happen."

People be getting tired of driving sometimes so they will buy one of those cars and drive it. In the story it stated that "" Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert people when to pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents"". There's certain things you can do while driving the car but you should also keep your eyes wide open and stay focus at all times while on the road because while you laying back doing whatever you doing your car is gong to stop automatically driving and you going to have to take the wheel of the car you cant go o sleep or nothing lke that while your driving.In paragraph 9 it stated that "" in certain states it is illegal to even test computer driven cars"". That's why I am for the ' driverless Cars Are Coming"". They making cars with sensors so all they can do is move their hands around or body and the car can automatically open ups for you. They have a display when the driver needs to take over, something not availabe to drivers trying to text with a cell phone. They are making it easier when you can text and call and be on your phone while your drving this time becuase in this way the car system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big thing when it comes to driving because its a big problem when people like to text and drive or get on the phone while they are in the car driving. They are considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaing focused on the road. While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver to see if they going to make any mistakes for fall sleep at the wheel while they are drving because if so they could call on somebody or wake them up just in case they come incounter of an accident that an car itself can not do. That's why i agree to having an automatic car driving for you when you need it."
9274,0,"Having technology decipher a student's face and push them onwards has the potential to be helpful. That way every student can be at the pace they need to be. Maybe they could decide earlier on what areas they excell at and what they dont. They might even figure out what path they would like to venture on to pursue their working future! Althought we don't know if it would always help, but it might be worth a shot. Maybe testing it out on a few schools first could help the process along. Students would have teh ability to work at their own pace. If a student does not understand a particular subject and their face shows their confusion the computer has the potential to recognize their discomfort with the subject and try to deliver more help. On the other hand if you enjoy one subject and the computer picks up on your delight towards the subject it would have the option to push you toward the more advanced level of that area. Students will have the opportunity to leaarn what their their understanding personality is, that would give them the option to find the traits theyre good at and ones they need a little more encourgement. For example: if a student has been exceding in engish he/she could become an author, editor, teacher, or journalist. Being privilaged to an understaning like that could help them determine their future. Although, there might be some downsides. What if the computer starts reading faces wrong? what if it confuses interested with bored? there are many things that could go wrong. what if the student stops trying and becomes reliant on the machine? I believe that they should test their ideas on a couple schools first. Just to get a feel of what it would be like working with technology of this sort.Maybe start in some libraries or special schools. Collect a poll of what others think. Make a list of all the goodand bad things and see what side out weighs the other. Programs and ideas like this could change the world. It's important that we encourage them and make sure we know what we're doing. When it comes down to it; the generation we raise is our future, so we better make it worth while."

According to the passage -''In German, life goes on without cars'', street parking, driveways, and home garages are forbidden in a new district on the outskirts of Frieburg. 70% Vauban families dont own cars and 57% sold there cars just to move. Many find it better this way. For example,Heidren Walter stated- '' When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.'' In Paris, France, there is more smog then any other European capital. According to the passage- ''Paris bans driving due to smog'', drivers were fined and motorists with even numbered license plates were forced to leave there cars at home. Diesal fuel is to blame for warmer layers of air traping car emissians. Delivery companies complained. However, exceptions were made for plug-in car, hybrids, and cars that can hold three or more people. When the smog cleared,the ruling French party rescinded the ban for odd numbered plates. According to the passage-''car- free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota''- this is the third year cars have been banned, this sets a goal to promote alternative transportation and to decrease smog. This program influenced two other Colombian cities to join and participate in trying to end all smog. The reduce of cars impacted Colombia in a positive way. Therefore, causing the air to blossom and the air to blossom and new construction to occur. In the U.S.A, President Obama's goal is to curb the U.S green house gas emissions. According to the passage-'' The end of car culture'', the U.S has peaked its driving miles in 2005 and dropped there after. A recent study found that driving by young people decreased 23% between 2001 and 2009. However the Mobile congress in Barcelona, Spain, laid out a business plan inwhich bicycles, private cars, and public transportation traffic would save time, conserve resources and save energy. Concluding to all my information, many countries and states are still trying to reduce car usage. Therefore, reducing smog and pollution. This will not only improve the air, it also solves our time, resource, and safety issues. This will help to improve society aswell. Therefore, we can live without cars."
1304,0,"In the story "" The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers it presents because Venus is Earth's twin and have many similiaraties, but also have a lot of differences with each other. Venus has weather that we will never be able to handle naturally and also scientists cannot take an samples of rocks,gas or anything else due to the technology we do not yet have.Earth is sometimes located right next to Venus it just depends how fast it orbits around the sun. Earth and Venus are the closest in density and size that's why they are twins with each other. Venus has really hot weather that we will never be able to handle naturally with out it killing us. We will need special suits to go up to Venus if we would want to stay up there for a couple of days not just hours. Also special foot gear because Venus has the hottest surface temperature then any other planet in our solar system. Venus has many similiaraties with Earth such as having erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes.I believe that if you want to go up to Venus you would need special suits and gear to resist its wild environment and also advanced improved technology to survive. I currently believe that if NASA want to take humans to another planet with its technology today, it would be a really bad idea because the space ships today would not be capable to resist its 800 degrees Fahrenheit surface. I think NASA should wait until later on technology is invented when making twice as better space ships today. NASA should no risk any humans up to Venus with out being 100 percent sure that they will return back to its family. Its spaceships today can only land for a couple of hours and thats it. I believe that if NASA want to take humans to another unknown planet then we should be 100 percent sure that everything will go the right way. Maybe sometime in the future NASA will sent humans to Venus without a doubt that they will ever come back. I believe NASA should keep improving there technology and keep sending machines up to other planets then humans. We are yet not ready to have send people to other planets besides the moon.Technology today can currently have humans survive but not be safe.I think that now is not the time to sned people up to the moon with NASA's spaceships and technology. I believe that studying Venus is a well worthy of persuit and I completely agree with the author, but later on in life when technology is improved. With Venus's climate we would not be capable to go up there and would not be sure of everything. NASA should keep inventing machines that will allow to bring back rocks, gas, or anything else. This is why I believe that us humans are yet not ready to go on a dangers well worthy adventure up to Venus right now."

The essay states that ""Most human communication is verbal, including human communication"" so when someone is communicating their emotions with another person, it might not be true. Dr. Huang predicts that "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then is could modify the lesson."" modifying the lesson to the students content facial expression, could make the student understand the things better. For example, on a website when an ad appears, if you smile, ""a similar ad may follow. but if you frown, the next ad will be different."" the same thing can happen on a classroom computer to help the student. In conclusion, having a classroom computer that recognizes your facial expressions is valuable and may really help a student understand or learn something in class easier."

There may be some ""liability"" in the manufacturing of these cars but there could be even greater achivements as well. Not including the abundance of money the economy would save on gas alone would be plentiful and amazing. There is without a doubt some faults in sensatizing in the automotavies being created. There will never not be faults in some sort of new brand from phones to airplanes there will always be a fault somewhere so to completely throw this idea out is absurd and uncalled for. Even now we still have a little help from our sensors an example would be the ""Dubbed LIDAR"" sensor on top of the car to sense the cars surroindings my mother is thankful for hers im sure. There is of course problems with driving assist somtimes it is others who cause the accident are technology can not control what us stupid humans decide to do, but mabe it can. With new and inproved drving assit there could be a possible decrease or reduction in accidents and automotavie fatalities. Drivless cars could sense a car coming into your lane sending the car into brake mode stopping it before your hit. There may even be a possibility the trafic lights connect with the sensors to alert the car to stop before running a red light and possibly killing a crossing pedestrian. As the article states "" None of the cars developed so far are completely driverless"". Without a doubt there would be at least one legislative pearson who would vote aggainst this. I was in a state of shock to learn that California and Florida are part of the verry few states who are against ""semis-autonomous cars"". Though they do have grounds for their descison do the fact they extremley populated and condensed they still should be open to the idea of driverless cars. Even thought there are states that do not agrree or even condone this there are still improvements being made to soon create a autonomous car. In conclusion I belive that no one pearson will understand the importance in autonomous cars. There will always be the possibility of theses cars to the save not only pople and money but the enviroment as well. There will never be a time on earth where we as humans will stop improving are lifes and necesities just rember that the next time somone mentions the autonomous car or the driverless car."

The driverless car would be a great achievement in human curisosity and invention. These cars would better many different levels of society if made and used propely. Drverless can be an innovation within our cumminties and cites. These cars could protect more lives and lower the amount of human recklessness that could be done at the wheel of a regular driven car. If made fully driverless, the amount of intoxicated accidents, killing and pull overs by the police would be lowered substancially. These smart cars could detect when their driver is not keeping a minimal amount of focus on the road and alert them to any dangers that could obstruct their path or cause harm. Only increasing the level of safety and efficencess that it would be used for. The support of the driverless car,though at the moment is not completely driverless, could keep many citizens safe and out of harm. The public eye sees these cars of dangerous because they do not wish to relinqiush their right of control over to the car and also they do not know what would replace the fun of driving in its stead. The makers have a few ideas on how to make the trip fun, but still lawmakers are trying to decide whether to trust that these cars are really that safe and how big their laws would ned to change for traffic, and the last big question who will take the blame for a crash that may happen. The safety issues are slowly being proven to the lawmakers on that it may be a better option then regular cars, but the other previously said descions have yet to be acted upon, except for its questioning. I do believe driverless cars if thought through and corrected for mistakes can become a valuable asset to modern day community. These cars could lead to a increase in driving, and traveling for families and could also lead to the question of what can we do with this technology now? I feel that these questions are a very good thing in the advanceing technology of this age and that the still developing cars should not be frowned upon, but seen as a step forward into atoumating our country."

There are picture taken by NASA that shows a landform that looks just like a face,and there is other rounded forms of land near it,so that makes me think its juat land. If you think its by aliens then you must think its because the aliens that we see have spaceships called UFOs. That would make a person think since they are smarter then us that they had amde it with tools of there own. Or even that they made a life form that guards the planet and stays in the ground until someone comes and intrudes. I would think in a more literal state,for an example i would also think a meteor had hit the planet in such a way that a piece flew off and looked just like a human face on accident. Although few scientists at NASA beleived that it was made by aliens, i still beleive that it was made by natural causes. On Sept. 1997 which was eighteen long years after the first picture by the spacecraft called the Viking. The new picture was so high def. it showed 1.56 meters per each pixel. YOU could se what exactly was arounf the face and even on the face. The land was rough so that explains to me that the face was built by natural cuases not by aliens."
15626,0,The face on mars some people say it ws created by alliens some think it is just the land shape form. I think it is just the land shape because it decaces over time anything can decae over time but it you was to go to mars and see if it wasa man or allien made thing or if it just the land shape instead of it being allien it could have been a human made thing no one knows. Plus theres no proven fact that allien exsist so to me their cant be a way that it was made by alliens. Now lets say it was made by alliens if so when and how was it created would be the qusetion if they have been studying mars they would need to study if there is any life in space or any strange objects out there. In the second paragraph it say that it look like a egyption parhroah why and how would alliens know what an egyption parahroah look like. If it is just how the land is shaped we would have to study why and how the land is shaped like that or something could have happen and cause the land to look like that maybe land erriosion in certian areas and it fromed that. Cause in the the pictuers they have it looks like they faceis fading away so it might just be errioson. So it might be alleins might bethe land shape or man made untill they make a trip to mars we may never know.
12701,0,"There are both positive and negitive aspects about driverless cars. How much money will this all cost? How about if this idea of a driverless car is unsafe? Can we trust these 10000 pound cars with our lifes? In my opionon i think we should just keep things how they are now, what is so bad about driving yourself? If were going to make driverless cars these manufactuers should actuly have them be diverless cars because the name is deciving, you still have to be alert and be prepared to take over. I think if your just relaxing and enjoying the ride and all of a sudden the car alerts you that you need to take over you wouldnt have an as quick of a responce time if you where to be driving and paying attention the whole time. Even if the manufactures had vibraving seats to alert you or flashing lights i still dont think people would have a good responce time. So in my opinion i do not think we should have driverless cars however i do think that we should have cars that can detect if where to close to somthing and it breaks automaticly. as for driving itsself and such i think its a bad idea."
1202,0,"First of all, the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers for many reasons, the first reason will be because they are not sure what can they find there so they need to be very prepared for any visual or physical contact in Venus. another reason will be because it's close to the sun, so that means a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Also in paragraph 2 says ""each previous mission was unmmaned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. In the paragraph 3 it says many reasons of why it is dangerous to go to study Venus more closer, it is dangerous to study Venus even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface. Our sister planet is so inhospitable; Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. In conclusion, its important to know the risk are you gone to made cause of your actions, this information is a clearly example of cause and effect; the plans can be finished good or bad."

11494,0,"There are millions of wrecks in the U.S. every year, some due to their own cars not being very reliable. Cars and their manufacurers must be very reliable when it comes to bringing up new models of vehicles. Imagine if you could cut the number of car wrecks in half. Technology is fast pacing and is advancing every day. What if we could have driverless cars, cars that could not only make the world a better place, but also prove how amazing our technology is. Driverless cars are the next, new future. Driverless cars have an abundant amount of pros and maybe a little bit of cons, but overall these cars can do great things. A driverless car could possibly stop different aspects of accidents happening. They could even get someone where they need to go. These cars can also help people who barely passed their driver's tests. The car could perform even the most basic stuff, such as, driving through the city, making turns, driving the steering wheel itself, and watching for dangerous things a new or inexperienced driver could not do. Being a new driver can be very challening at first and may even bring a traumatic experience. Coming off as a new driver and only having my license for three months, I know what the pressure can feel like when you feel like you havent learned soemthing and you are already on your own. There are some cons when it comes to new driverless cars; Let's say someone is in a wreck and later come to find the car had failed them, who is responsible now? The manufacturer. The car could fail out of nowhere with no warning signs and even cost someone their life. Though there have been studies, a driverless car could have a potential downfall affect on drivers. Some could feel like they can be lazy and not have to worry about their surroundings and cause an accident that way; A person could even fall asleep at the wheel and do more damage than good. Some states make it illegal to even drive computer-type cars because of a law they have. Driverless cars come with baggage on both sides of good and bad, but with a little more knowledge and research it could change someone's opinion overtime. They could potentially save someone's life and other people surrounding them. They could save a new driver's life and could even help them learn all of the skills of the road. With the new techonology we have in this new future, we could cut the wreck numbers in half to seventy five percent. Driverless cars are not a bad idea and they could possibly save this world."
20720,0,"Dear State Senator, I agrue in favor of keeping the Electoral College, for this reason it wouldhave to be the fact that it is a much easier method electing presidental canditates. At times I know it can be unfair to most of the voters around the nation but this way is more easier than it might already seem. Instead of the people voting for which they think is the new president, it would be more likely the electors who elect the president for the state. These slate of electors are trusted to vote for the party's nominee. For some states it wouldn't be just random it be either democratic, or republicians. When having the electors it wouldbe possible to be the winner of the electoral vote but not the national popular vote. For the president's chance of winning having an Electoral College will exceed his share of popular vote. An example would be the election backin 2012, Obama had 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared 6to what Romeny had because most of the states awarded the eletoral votes on the winner-take-all basis, can get a chance of having victory in winning the electoral vote. But there would be a possible chance of having a tie against the states. Another reason for this debate would have to be the reason that the candidates themseveles have to get the regional appeal from the states. For Romeny that gave him an opporunity but had little to offer. He no electoral votes in the states that he knowshe will win. For this unsuccessful result, Romeny only had regional appeal there for he was less likely to successed in the southern region. For other states that felt as if their votes didn't count, so there for assumed that Romeny had little interest, leading to the thought of an unlawful candidate. Swing states on the other hand have a chance of making it. The reason for that being is voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign knowing that they are going to decide the election. On avergae they are are thought of as the most thoughtful voters (the result is that they have recieved more information and attention from the candidates. Electoral Colleges balance the weight in political balance that larger states lose virtue of the Senate. For Obama he won that vote based on the amount of electoral votes he recieved from Florida was 29. Also 3 from the state of Wyoming. In other reasons, larger states recieve the most attention from the candidates than the small states do. Based on the information I have provided you in this statement, I will concluded that sometimes this method can be a little complicated to most voters in the U.S. For the reason is that most of the smaller states remain unseen by the candidates of the elections but sometimesend up winning thepopluar vote for the candidate they chose. In the beginning in starting the Electoral College was held by our founding fathers of this great nation. There for this methodshouldremain as it should. Thank you for your consideration. Yours Turely, PROPER_NAME"
17558,0,"Have you ever heard of high-resolution images and 3D altimetry? If you haven't, it is technology that helps us scientists here at NASA take a closer look at images from the Global surveyor. We have been doing this for quite a while now, and in 1976 we got our first picture of a ""Face"" on Mars. We call it the Face because it has formal structures that look like eyes, a nose, and a mouth. We were very curious about this structure, so we decided to send the surveyor back to get another perspective. We got our second picture in 1998, which came out more clear and looked more like a face. In 2001 we went back for a final time, and we have concluded that this form that looks like a Face is nothing more that just a natural landform. You may not believe me when I say this, but trust me, my job at NASA is not only performing tests, but also to put the results into a viewers' perspective. Around 40 years ago, we recieved a funny photo of what looked like a Face, however, technology wasn't too strong back then. With all the tools that we use today, we were able to hypothesize that the Face is just a Martian mesa. A martian mesa is a huge rock formation, it just so happens that this rock had shadows around it giving it the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. To prove this hypothesis correct, we sent out the Mars Global Surveyor to snap pictures that were ten times sharper that the original photos taken of the Face. After observing these photos, we concluded that the Face is just a simple natural landform, and there was no life on Mars and no alien monument after all. Conspiracy theorists did not believe the tests as they were taken on a cold winter day, they said aliens may have been ""hibernating"". So again on April 8, 2001, we went back and took another shot. This time we were able to finally conclude once and for all, that the Face is nothing but nature on its own course."

Why would you sit on the couch and do nothing, when you can actually do SOMETHING. Instead of just sitting on the couch and watching Television you could be saving many of peoples lives that have been affected by the war. I'm not saying that everyone just sits on a couch all day and watches Television because I know people have jobs and kids and other important things to do, but I know that atleast 100,000 people in this world just sit around doing nothing. If you have free time on your hands why not help out some other countries that have been left in ruins and are in need of food. I think it'd be a thing to do if you have to much time on your hands. People should come help other counties with the Seagoing Cowboys program because you'd be able to go to alot of places and go sight seeing while saving people. I know some poeple would love to go and see other places in this world but don't have a really good reason to except to go see some things, well now you do. You can go to places almost all over the world to help other people recover from the war but while you're there and you have some free time you can also go sight seeing and take some pictures to bring back home if you want. It will be an epic adventure if you help out this program. Im positive that it will be a fun experience. I know some people are probably thinking ""Well thats not our problem, that's their problem."" but it doesn't matter if it's their problem or our problem. If we were badly effected by a war I'm positive they would help us out. Now if you were badly effected by the war and left in the ruins without any food or any help wouldn't you want someone to help you? I know that I would want someone to help me. Why don't you pretend you're in their shoes? You wouldn't want other people to just sit there and not help out. I'm sure that those people are very thankful and glad that the Seagoing Cowboys program is helping them out. The Seagoing Cowboys program is a great opportunity to get to do something and change the world. Already fourty four nations have joined this program to help others out so why don't you join too? It may be a long trip to the destination you're helping but it's worth it. This is why I think that people should join the Seagoing Cowboys with me.

I also found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for me.

I would love to make the trip over the Atlantic! One reason why is because I would love to make a great journey and explor. My other reason would be that I would love to make the travel to help other countries. My last reason would be that I like to care for animals. Did you know that in 1947 the United States helped build other countries up? We brought over our animals to help other people out!! Isn't that just so helpful?! Some pros and cons will help you understand what happened on Lukes journey. My first pro would be that ""Luke was working a two-part time jobs in a grocery store and a bank when his friend Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke could not say no. He knew it was an opportunity of a liftime."" The reason why I out this as a pro is because Don is sort of begging Luke to go. More encouraging him of why he should go. My last pro would be that ""It was 1945, WWII was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form the UNRRA (The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration)."" The reason why I made this a pro is because to show how the nations joined together to help save other countries. My first con would be of my own. I think that if you were to make this journey, then you would have to face the dangers of the Atlantic Ocean. My last con would be when Luke was doing his night jobint the rain, when it was time to go tell the captain that the cattle was okay. When he made his way half way up the latter, he slipped and fell. The thing is, is that he was sliding toward an opening in the boat, but a piece of metal caught hime. He had cracked two ribs after that fall. That tells you that it is very dangerous to do that stuff. Especially when you are climbing a METAL latter during a hard rainfall. If I were to go I would have to watch out for all the bad things that can occur in the water. So, what would you go accross the Atlantic ocean?"

I personally feel as if this can be use for other things. My reason why is because if you only get a very small amout of usage if you were to use it only for class room students. Like maybe for bullying and for art like its main use. The bullying thing is like you can find out if a kid is being bullied by looking at a recent photo of the student then going from the is feel in the photo. The art part is for kids who wanna be artist. I feel like if we where gonna use this we can use it for, hiring workers by obtaing the additude for work, police work, Drama class, Companys, College and much more. I can get deeper into this by saying that for the work part can be used by figure out how people will work for you at your job like if Bill really wants the job or if he's not excited for it and can be a hassel to deal with. Or maybe for police work you can figure out by thier face if they're truthfull or not. For drama class people can practice over and over again to pull off real face emotions so when a show in New York City and feels feal and much more My conclusion is that we should be using this type of technology for more things than just a silly class room we can solve people social problems with this stuff and understand how people feel.

In paragraph 5 it says Luke got to tour a ecavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to china. He also saw the Acropolis in Greece. You get to see these things maybe once in a life time. Seagoing Cowboys get to spend a lot of time with animals. The animals are mules, horses, and etc. You have to care for them all the time. You have to take them to the places they need to be. It says in paragraph 3 that you get plenty of oats and hay. When you have free time you can play games to pass the time. In paragragh 8 it says that the crew men play baseball, volleyball, table-tennis tournamnets, fencing, and boxing. They play these games in empty holds where animals have been housed. The fun things to do are thoses. So being a Seagoing Cowboy is fun to. That is why being a Seagoing Cowboy is fun and cool.

However, one area that still needs possible improvement is the classroom. Over many decades, schooling has remained extremely similar. Yes, with the introduction of technology into the classroom, students are able to do things today that was never possible before. In the modern classroom, teachers continue to try their hardest to fit lessons to the liking of their students. But when a student is bored, the teacher cannot always recognize that and change the composition of the lesson. With the invention of Facial Action Coding System, or FACS, computers are now able to read the emotions of humans. By introducing FACS into the classroom, the education of students will be more fit to their learning style which can help students to absorb information and put the future of America into good hands. The FACS technology provides teachers with an opportunity to mold lessons to individual students and to keep them engaged. One way to do this would be to install simple instructions for classroom computers so that it could ""recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" and then inform the teacher and the teacher can find a way to alter the lesson. For example, if a student goes to their science class and the teacher is standing at the front of the room lecturing, the student will begin to become bored. The FACS software would then be able to inform the teacher and he or she could find a way to make the lesson more interactive. Another application that would be helpful in schools would be in psychology classrooms. By integrating this software into psychology classrooms, students would be able to learn human emotions with a much more hands-on experience. Instead of a teacher simply telling them how to read the emotions of humans and how the human face manipulates the muscles to express emotion, the teacher would be able to show the workings of the FACS software and explain to the students how each person's face can vary. In the end, the implementation of this software into the classroom would be beneficial to the teachers and the students. The teachers would be able to teach lessons that keep students engaged and the students would be able to absorb more information if the lesson is altered to their learning style. By not implementing this technology into the classroom, schools are losing opporunities to improve the learning of their students and the teaching of their teachers."
209,0,"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" does not do a good job of supporting their idea. The author believes that, while Venus is dangerous it is worthy of spending time and money to explore this planet. The author mentions the similaities between earth and venus, makes exploring this planet so fascinating. The author later goes on to explain how NASA would travel and explore Venus, and what tools they would use to explore Venus. How NASA would travel to Venus is irrevalate to if Venus is worth exploring. Because, the author spends a majority of their time telling us how, NASA would learn more about Venus. Is not needed to prove and explain why exploring Venus is nessacary. The author spends three of their six body paragraphs explaining how NASA would explore the planet of Venus. In paragraph 6 they explain that sending an orbiting ship around the planet will provide limited insight of the ground below,and the only way to gain more knowledge is to be able to collect rock and gas samples. The author never states what we could possiable learn from the rock samples, or even elbrates on the idea of collecting a varity of samples from the planet. They later spend paragraph 7 explaining the history of computers and how much computes have progressed since 1800. They even explain the mechainics of computers during the World War II for example, ""these devices make calculations by using gear and levers and do not require electronics at all."" The mechainics of computers has nothing to do with the idea that we should be exploring NASA. The infomation provided in paragraph 5 through 7, such as the history and mechanics of computers. The little infomation given on how a rock sampple will help us learn about Venus, or that NASA isn't able to gain enough infomation from sending a hovering ship about the planet, do not help or support the authors claim that Venus is worthy of exploring despite the dangers. To summorize, the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" does not do a good job of explaining the why Venus is worthy is studying and exploring, despite the dangers. The author spends to much time explaining computers, the history and the mechainics of them, and what we could learn about Venus through computers. They also use their time to tell their readers that sending an orbiting ship around plant won't provided us with enough infomation, and to explain how they would explore Venus and the tools they would use. The author did a poor job of explaining the importance of exploring Venus despite the dangers."
6837,0,"The computer software is very valuable. It can calculate diffrent emotions, it can tell if the smile is fake or not, and it can show varying degrees of expression. The new computer software can recognize if your friend is happy or not. The software can calculate diffrent emotions. On paragraph 3 it says that Eckman has classified 6 basic emotions, happyness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. This means that the computer can calculate which emotion is showing the most by calculating the muscel movement. The emotion that has the most percent is the emotions that your freind or someone is most likey showing. The computer can also detect if your smile is real or not. In paragraph 8 its says ''if the zygomatic is streched sideways then you are fake smiling. The zygomatic is a muscel in your face that can make you smile and if you stretch it sideways then the smile is fake. If you were to be mad you could fool your friends but not fool the computer. The computer can show the percent in which you are smiling. Paragraph 5 it states that the computer software stores simular antomical information as an electronic code. The code enters in the computer and it reads the code to tells you the percent of youe emotions. It dosnt take a long time at all it reads your face with a 3-D scanner. The computer software is very valuable. It can tell a lot of emotions that you or your friend has. Wouldn't you wanna know how happy or sad you or your friend are? The computer would just do everything for you instead of you asking questions about your friend or you friend asking questions about you."
17751,0,"The future is fast approaching, and with it comes new ideas and new inventions, some to merely enhance our daily lives, and some to improve our overall safety. One such idea, and quite possibly a new invention, is the driverless car. A car that can drive itself without the assistance of a human. While this will make many trivial problems a thing of the past, it will introduce several new problems and questions. Driverless cars will cause problems with liability, with the added effect of being costly. With the introduction of driverless cars, one question begs to be answered, what will be the cost of it? As the article mentions, technology is an important part of the driverless car. Google's modified Toyota Prius uses many sensors and radars, such as position estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview window, four autmotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor. With quite a few pieces of technology attached to it, there is no possible way that driverless cars will be cost effective, unless a new cheaper way to produce such pieces of technology is developed. Cost aside, the article mentions the possibility of the technology failing, and something going awry. Who is to blame if a driverless car causes or is part of an accident? As the article states, new laws will have to be passed to cover liability. And yet the question of who is at fault, the driver or manufacurer, still remains and quite possibly cannot be answered until such an accident occurs. At the end of the line, the cost of the driverless car and all the technology to ensure it is safe, cannot be pushed aside. Furthermore, the issues with liability will cause nothing but trouble for both manufacturer and individual alike."

11012,0,"I think it would be cool to have a driverless car. I would say that even in a driverless car, the driver should still be able to take control when needed. I think we should keep it to where the driver could take control whenever, because of road construction. I would say that a driverless car, with also control of a driver would be fine. I would say it's fine because, Google has drove driverless cars under specific conditions since 2009. They have driven more than hald a million miles without a crash. I think they are saying it is safe. Also, the Google cars aren't actually driverless because, they are alerted when to do something. These alerts are for example, when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, as in roadwork or accidents. I think it would be cool to have one when you need to answer an emergency call. It will be safe to answer the call, because if you need to take control it will alert you. If someone was injured, I would say it would be the manufacturers fault. I would say it's the manufacturers fault, because they are the ones who made it, they were in control of making the car the whole time. I would say a driverless car would be safe, in only some conditions. These conditions would be, when the car alerts the driver when they need to step in and drive. Another condition would be where the car would know where the road construction sites are, and would take the clear path to get to the destination of where the driver wants to go. Overall, I would say that a driverless car is safe."
6156,0,"What if your teacher could actually know exactly how you are feeling? I think the use of a new technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom would be very valuable, due to the fact that they could give a teacher more insight on how their students really feel, and even let a student know that they are not the only ones who might feel the way they do. Finally, this technology could help modify lessons and increase student productivity. This technology could give teachers more insight on how their students really feel due to its extroardinary system. Paragraph 3 talks about how the process begins, cause the big question here might be, "" Can you actually ""calculate"" emotions- like math problems?"" Or, ""How can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel?"" The text states how the process includes constructing a 3-D computer model of the face and how with the work of physhologists the emotions can be defined. If this system is as valauable as the text states it to be, then letting a teacher know how the students actually feel could be effecient to the the teacher, because they can try to comprehend the students and show their support to them as well. Nowadays teachers seem to think that they are the only ones with problems which is not at all true. This technology could also be of value if it even lead to letting classmates know that they are not the only ones dealing with the emotions that they have, in fact many others could feel the exact way. Sometimes students feel that they are dealing with emotions alone. This technology could change that. Letting other students know of how a class mate is feeling could be very helpful. Not obly that, but knowing or seeing that others are happy could bring a smile to your face. Paragraph 6 states, ""The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it just shows how much this computer can do."" The capability of this technology just sounds like it can change lives. The classroom computer could also help to modify a lesson if a student is bored. The text states, "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This could improve productivity. The Facial Action Coding System could be very valuable in a classroom, due to such a great software it uses. This sytem could impact not only a classroom, but lives."
2512,0,"In the story Venus is sometimes called the ''Evening Star'' is one of the brightest points in the night sky,making it simple for even an amateur stargaze to spot. The nickname was misleading because Venus is actually a planet. Often referred to as Earth's ''twin'' Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size,and occasionally the closest in distance too. Venus is sometimes around the corner in space terms humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned and for good reason,since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. On the planet's surface,temperature average over 800 degress Fahrenheit,and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than we experience on our own plant. Also Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Long ago Venus was maybe or probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like Earth. Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere,rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow their machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to their knowledge of Venus. NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. Studying to meet the challange presented by Venus has value,not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. The author wants to know everything about Venus and will do anything to get the information he wants."
12249,0,"The invention of driverless cars is a terrible idea. There are way too many concerns to deal with. The law plays a big role in driverless cars. It is illegal to test computer driven cars in all states except for California, Nevada, and Flordia. If driverless cars are made, new laws would have to be made. The country would have to legalize the testing of driverless cars. A law would have to be made incase accidents occure. People may attempt to sue the company if the if they get into an accident. Who would be to blame: the driver or the company? Driverless cars would still have to have a driver in the car incase the car itself cannot perform an action. That is a concern. The driver would only be needed for a few things, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. The driver would get bored. They might get on their cellphones. They may even fall asleep. The driver would not pay attention. That would cause an accident. Good things can come out of driverless cars. The public transportation would benefit from driverless cars. Google cofounder Sergey Brin envisions a public transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public-transport taxi system. The driverless car would use half of the fuel of today's taxis and would offer more flexibility than a bus. Driverless cars could fundamentally change the world. The biggest concern with driverless cars is saftey. Many malfunctions could take place. The driverless car would take a lot of sensors. There would be sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, four automotive sensors, an intertial motion sensor, and a spinning sensor on the roof of the car. The sensors would use laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings. The driverless car would also need a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror. The video camera is used to detect what is behind the car. The driverless car would also need a GPS system to know where to go. Those three features would be needed to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel. If any of those features malfunction, the car could go berserk. There could be an accident. That would cause saftey issues, and saftey is the biggest concern. Driverless cars should not become a thing. Good can come out of the driverless cars, but there are many more cons than pros."
9689,0,"Why do you think Don Reist want Luke Bomberger to join the Seagoing Cowboys program? Well, i think he wants him to join the Seagoing cowboys program because he probably really like it, and want his friend to join. One reason i think Luke joined because like he say, he think it would be an opportunity of a lifetime. in the passage it states UNRRA hires seagoing cowboys to take care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas, Luke and Don signed up. The passage also states in August 1945, they recieved their orders to report to New Orleans. They arrived August 14 which was the day pacific war ended. Another reason i think Luke wanted to join, because his friend was their and he wanted to be with his friend, and do what he are doing now. The passage states when Luke's draft board learned that he was on a cattle boat, they told him to just keep doing that for his service. The passage also states Luke turned 18 before arriving in greece, which meant he could be drafted in military service. The whole thing to the paragraphs and all the supporting details is that Don wanted Luke to be like him and asked him to sign up so they could be with eachother. They wanted to have good opportunities with eachother t, they wanted to grow up and become something just from being stated in the seagoing cowboy program. Like they say in the story at 18 before arriving in Greece you could be drafted in military. That right there means they wanted to be something like a star that everyone wants to meat or be important or be famous, because lots of times it gets boring sitting around all the time. They said "" hey lets get up and go sign up for something to become something together since we are close friends. """
22121,0,"The Electoral College is not a place but a process. The Electoral College process consists of the slection of the electors. the electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. "" Its official: the eclectoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" The electoral college is not fair to voters even at the most basic level. Some states dont even get to see the candidates because they dont spend any time in states they know they dont have a chance of winning in. During the 2000 compaign seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all because of the winner- take- all system. The electoral college does restore some of the weight in the political balance in large states. Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over sixty percent would perfer a direct vote than have the elctoral college vote also. The vote could be very close even if one candidate wins by much in the popular vote due to the presidency vote. If there was a tie in the electoral vote the election would be thrown to the House of Represenstatives. Instead of all that work if there was only a popular vote it would be quick and simple. Voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a singke ad campaign because the candidates didnt think they could win there. ""If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidnecy in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it...."".

8250,0,"I strongly believe that the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because teachers never know when their students are feeling down. Also, some students can't talk about their feelings or express them because they are afraid other will make fun of them, and or they don't have anybody that they can trust. If this technology really works maybe it will help with communication and helping others being able speak up, and tell adults what's on their mind. In the article is says that ""mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"", and this shows that this technology could really tell how you are feeling. It can also tell you when you are faking a smile, and when you are really meaning it. In the article it also says that ""the facial expressions for each emotion are universal"", which to me means that you can't change the way your face expressions your emotions. When someone's face changes thats when you know how they are feeling, by the way they look. To sum it all up, I believe that the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. Not everybody can be confident enough, and some can't trust others with their feelings, because they always end up getting hurt, nobody really ever cares about how you feel, and some people just want to know what is going on to make fun of you, and or hurt you."
11938,0,"As we advance in the future new ideas come up and are trying to be developed, One going on right now is the idea of driverless cars. There are many good things and bad things that could come out of this. Yet I am not fully for the idea of driverless cars. The first reason why is the expenses. The passage says that these cars would use half the amount of fuel as the cars we have now, but the money saved from using less fuel would take many years to equal out to the expensises of the modifications to the cars. One huge expense could be if we go the route of the idea in paragraph three we would have to modify every single one of our exsisting roads which I think would cost more than it's worth. Another expense that we would have if we took the idea from paragraph four would be all of the expensive sensors we would have to put on the car to make it safe to put on roads. For example just of the technology they give us there are seven different peices of equipment used and since these are of higher advancment then of what we have now the car in general would cost more. The second idea of support is what is the point of driveless cars if you still have to be alert and have your hands on the wheel. This I believe is a big problem,because if you still have to be alert you can't be doing other things so then companies lose the interestof the buyers. This can also be seen in the point getting bored at the wheel. If the driver isn't engaged they are going to lose interest, but yet they have to pay attention so if you are bored why not use a regular car that lets you do the work. One point that the authors of this brought up was the idea of putting heads-up entertinment systems that shut off as soon as you need to drive these are to avoid my previous point of getting bored yet there is a problem with this idea. The authors say that while you are ""driving"" the driverless car you need to be alert, but if you are paying attention to a screen i front of you are not going to be alert in your surroundings so when you do need to take hold you have no idea whats infront of you. Thirdly is the point of changing all of the driving laws. With all of the problems that there are with these cars is it worth taking out the current driving laws to insert a whole new set. This means that pretty much anyone with a license would have to learn a whole new set of laws and have to retake a driving test which would be a pain for everyoneincluding the bureu because they would be so overwhelmed. So in conclusion there is really no point for these cars, because of the many problems they hold. Including laws, expensises, and boredom of the driver. So in my opinion these new cars are a no go."
19416,0,"There are many advantages and disadvantages to driverless cars. Overall, more things could go wrong with driverless cars than goes right. Every since the first cars were built, people all over the world have loved drving, owning, and working on cars. It is part of Americans life to own a car. Driverless cars will make us lazy and unrealiable in times when we need to give direction or actually drive. I think driverless cars are inferior because people love cars, millions of jobs revolve around people driving cars, and people would become far too lazy if they didn't have to drive. First, people all over the world love cars. They love everything about them. They love the freedom they have while driving them and the feeling of independence. People love working on cars and restoring old cars to be like new. If cars suddenly became driverless, all of the things people love about cars would history. Next, millions of jobs involve people driving. Truck and taxi drivers would lose their job to computers. This would result in even more unemployment and frustration. We would lose control on things that humans could do better. Not to mention bus drivers, how would driverless cars know when to wait on someone running late? Or if someone on the bus forgets to get off? Human drivers can remember and remind the passengers if they forget or are not paying attention. Finally, people would become lazy knowing that they don't need to drive anymore. People would not memorize routes and get lost without the aid of the driverless car. If the driverless car were to break down, how would the passenger know how to fix it or what to do? Over time the driverless cars would be the only cars available and everyone at the BMV's, taxi companies, bus stations, and trucking, comapnies would lose their jobs to driverless cars. In conclusion, driverless cars are inferior because people love cars,millions of people's jobs revolve around driving cars, and people would become far too lazy if they didn't have to drive. Driverless cars could cause a lot more problems then people realize. It could cost millions of peole their jobs. Also everyone around the world that loves cars the way they already are would be heartbroken. The automotive industry is a major finacial buff to the US economy and driverless cars could jeprodize it."
9479,0,"Driverless cars both have good and bad aspects. I have reasons on why we should not have driverless cars. With driverless cars it makes people more lazy, accidents are more likely to happen, and a lot of people are not going to know the rules of the road as they should with driverless cars. It is lazy to have driverless cars because people would feel since they don't have to drive they don't have to pay attention to the road. Also, most people will just sit there on their phones and chat and think that it's okay. No one will actually pay attention because of the fact that it is a driverless car, but they do still need to be driven by a human when it comes to specific complications. Such as, when there is traffic or certain road conditions. If people are not paying attention then how exactly will they know. Accidents are more likely to happen with driverless cars. All drivers should be aware of the rules of the road. If the driver is not paying attention and the car is in need for a human to drive it is likely that the car will lose control and an accident can happen. That would make the roads more dangerous than they already are. That's why if there were driverless cars the driver still needs to have all eyes on the road. For new drivers with driverless cars they will not know the rules of the road like they should. If they are driving a driverless car they most likely are not paying attention to the road and knowing exactly when to go, when to stop, and what the signs on the road mean. Without knowing the rules of the road it is hazardous for you and other people driving. If driverless cars are to happen everyone should still practice they rules, especially if the car is in need for a human to drive. That will make the roads safer. In conclusion, driverless cars shouldn't be taken into consideration. It is hazardous and more likely to cause accidents. People should be very careful and know exactly what they are doing if there will be driverless cars."

Imagine someone acting to be really happy with a big smile in their face, and then actually being upset about something. The article had a lot of possitive points about this technology. A lot of people would say no to this technology because they are getting checked by a computer. Some are also very excited to see if the computer would actually say how they are feeling and their imotions they are feeling. It can calculate how you feel just by constructing your face and seeing how all 44 mucles of your face are. Dr. Huang says ""the facial expressions for each emotion are universal, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expresion."" He is trying to say that even when people try to change the way their face acts. The computer may still know how your actual emotions are. These new technology is so amazing because it can even be on your own PC. Scientst have used these technology to in many things. They have used it specially in the famous art work of Leonardo da Vinci's, Mona Lisa. They have found out how she was actually feeling when she was being drawn. These new technology can actually calculate every emotion. Even if it is in the past. All these amazing things about this technology should be valuable in classroom. The students would be able to study new things about how this actually works. How it can make everyone feel better about it. The students actually doing this things with these technology would actually make them a bit happier. This is why this technology that reads expressions should be valuable in a classroom."
19559,0,"Diverless cars I think could be a very good thing to this world. There are some down falls to them but if we put in the right time, i bielieve that we could make it a very useful tool in our enviroment. In this passage i am going to tell you why i bielieve that we should go to computer cars, or at least computer cars that give the human the right to driver, rather than only human conroled cars. My first argue is that it could help us with drunk or tired drivers. For example if someone was out late drinking, or was intoxicated. They could easily get home with out anyone being worried about there safety or safety of others because the computer is taking care of all of that. There would be no more drunk driving and i think everyone agrees that would be a great thing to happen in this world.it would save many lives every year. Also with tired drivers, say that your on vacationand have a gery long drive ahead of you. or coming home from a very long day of work. and keep nodding off while driving. You could just flip the car into computer mode and have the car drive without having to worry about falling asleep behind the wheel. Also the driver wont have to worry about being distrcted by screaming kids, loud noises, your text messages popping up while driving etc.All those distracts gone. This is a computer is does not reconize any of those actions. It will only know its job, and that job is to drive the car safely My second reason is i think it would be much safer in genral. imaired drivers or perfectly fine drivers.it doesnt matter who you take. Computers are smarter then humans they will not make the same dumb mistakes humans make like running a red light, or going above the speed limit, or driveing reckless in snowy icy conditions.The car will do everything it has to do to keep you and your family safe. Also if everyone on the road has computer driven cars. no body will have to worry about crazy drivers everyone will be calm and okay. Because a safe device is in control of your. My last reason is the police. I bielieve that if these cars become a thing the enviroment will become a better place. Also there will be less police chases. And im not saying the police will be off the road completely but if they dont have to worry about reckless drivers as much, they will be able to go out and deal with much more serious crime, because they know that these computers will follow the rules of the road. Say one day there was a police chase though. These are computers here. the police should be able to hack into the car and shut it down completly before any harm is done to any one. Those are my 3 reasons that i bielieve that computer driven cars would be a great resource to our community the police services, drunk or impaired drivers, and just safer driving in general. If you dont think that these cars are safe, i think you should change your opinion before they would be relased they would under go numerous ammonunts of testing to make sure that, they okay to be driven on the open roads. once again those are my 3 reasons. thankyou for reading."

A good thing about it is that in paragraph 7, it talks about the sertain kind of things that remind you that danger is coming. One of the things is that if your close to backing up into a car behind you, your seat starts vibrating to let you know that you need to stop. A bad thing is that it can cause the driver to be lazy toward driving and maybe cause them to not pay attention as much. All drivers should always pay attention to the road just in case danger is on the way. What if the car doesn't tell you when danger is coming becuase it messes up? You would need to be paying attention to know that there would be danger coming if the car didn't tell you. I think that driveless cars would be pretty cool, but why not stick to the safer rout of just actually paying attention to the road at all times when you are driving. In my opinion, if there ever was driveless cars around when I was alive, I would want a regular car just so I feel more safe knowing that I am in control of the car I am in. This is my position/opinion on these driveless cars."
16742,0,Will these cars stop all the accidents. The research that this passage has gave us is that it may work. My concern if i bought one of these cars what if you break down and there is a problem with the engine but you dont know how to fix it and cant afford road side assitiance. How would you get to places. Would we put the adress of where we want to go or tell the car with our voices where to take us. If the car dosent respond to tht then what do we do push the car NO. I dont think driverless cars are a good idea. Also we wouldnt have to have a driver licence to drive a driverless care. Someone can be 14 and drive on of those. I just dont think that its a good idea. People would do some pretty dumb stuff i feel like they might let there 11 year old gp to the gas station down a couple of streets and let him take their driverless car and that is how people will cause an accident.

4856,0,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, a new techonology known as the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) provides computers and devices to identify emotions in humans. The techonlogy does this through scanning facial muscle movements and with basic psychology knowldege. However, this new techonlogy is also being proposed to being used in schools to have more effective schooling based on the emotions of students. The using of FACS to determine the emotinos of students is valuable because it allows for more interactive lessons that are based off of non-verbal communication, which will help students succeed at a higher level. With the inception of FACS, the interactions between humans and computers can become more efficient, and will allow for more streamlined communication. In the article, Dr. Huang, the creator of FACS, states that ""Most human communication is nonverbal, inlcluding emotional communication"". If in a classroom situation, a computer trying to teach a lesson with students might not be able to understand if its pupils are getting the concepts, or it wouldn't be able to dectect whether the students are paying attention or being engaged. Since most human interactions are non-verbal, the computer would have a hard time communicating with the students to understand what was wrong. With FACS, however, the computer can analyze non-verbal cues and alter its teaching style. This in turn would allow the students to have a better time and have a higher understanding of the materials being learned. Not only does the concept and development of FACS allow for more streamlined communcation between humans and computers in the classroom, it also removers barriers between humans and computers by allowing computers to act more like humans, creating a more effective learning environment. In the article, D'Alto states that like how FACS learns to interpret emotions based on non-verbal facial cues, ""we humans perform this same impressive 'calculation' every day"". This means that by giving computers/teachers the ability to accuratley identify emotins (to some extent), we are lessening the difference between a physical and a digitial teacher by making the computer more ""human"". In an age where the world is becoming more and more digital, it is a neccesity that students and computers are able to communicate effectively. If Dr. Huang's quote ""'The facial expressions for each emotion are universal'"", is true, this means that if a computer can analyze mixed human emotions in a classroom setting, it is possible that not only will the computer modify lesson plans to make teaching more interesting, it will also have an almost artificial empathy, allowing for students to be more accepting of a digitial counterpart. In addition to streamlining communication and being more relatable to students, the usage of FACS system in a classroom computer can also be used to solve conflicts and make resolutions between students. In the article, D'Alto states that some facial muscle movements, showcase negative emotinos and false emotions as well. One of these muslces is the orbicularis oris, which tightens one's lips to show anger. Furthermore, certain muslce cues ""even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one"". Since FACS is able to analyze these kinds of movements as well, it can detect when two students are angry at one another, or when a student is lying or being subtly disrepctful. By being able to recognize these situations, the FACS system can advise teachers on how to solve these various conflicts or negative scenarios and can be of use to better the general nature of the classroom. Overall, throughout Nick D'Alto's article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", it is shown that by using the technology known as FACS, communcation between humans and computers can be streamlined. When placed in a school, FACS is valuble because it modify lessons to make teaching more effective, be more relatable and approachable to students, and can resolve conflicts in a classroom. In the future, with more and more systems such as FACS being implemented, it is possible that soon computers will devlop emotions of their own!"
24214,0,"Dear Senator, The electoral college is a process that the founding fathers extablished as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and popular vote of the people. This process involves selecting the electors, meeting with the electors, and counting the votes by congress. There are 538 electors total in the Electoral College. The presidential election happens every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. After the election the governor makes a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" which has all the names of the candidates who ran for President. I believe we should keep the Electoral College because there is a certainty of outcome, it helps avoid run-off elections, and the electoral college helps balance out the smaller and bigger states with more people that vote. The outcome of an Electoral College has a possibility of creating a dispute like in 2000, but this dispute is less likely to happen over a dispute over the popoular vote. This is because the winning candidates share of the Electoral College is greater than his share of the popular vote. Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote in comparison to the 51.3 percent of popular votes for him and Mitt Romney. Trans-regional appeal is required in the Electoral College. If we got rid of the Electoral College then there would be a greater possibility of dispute. Furthermore, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes while winning a majority in the Electoral College. This proves that the Electoral college avoids the problems of elections in which neither candidate receives a majority of the votes. When no candidate wins a majority the pressure complicates the presidential election process. The Electoral College minimized this pressure be invariably producing a clear winner every time. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. In addition, a large state gets more attention from candidates than a small sate in a campaign. As an example in 2012 Obama, got 29 electoral votes. In Wyoming the winner only had 2 electoral votes in the same marin as Obama. The Electoral College provides some kind of restoration for the weight in the political balance that large states lose by mal-apportionment of the Senate. Voters in toss-up states are more likely to read into and pay more attention to a campaign because they know they are going to decide the election. It is most likely that these people are going to the the most thoughtful voters. To conclude, there are many reasons to keep the Electoral College. This process has made the winner of the election much clearer to decide. There are a lot of pros and cons to the Electoral College but the list of cons is way shorter than the list of all the pros to the Electoral College. We should keep the Electoral College because it creates a certainty of outcome, diminishes run-off elections, and creates a balance for the bigger states. The Electoral College has created a positive impact for our presidential election. Sincerely, PROPER_NAME"
23752,0,"Automobiles are the key essential to people's everyday life. It allows them to get from point A to point B. But the outcome from the rise of these machines, are the amount of pollution they had cause. Limiting there usage seems the right action to do. Our specimen has been living for thousands of year without automobilies. What's the point of using them if their risking the life of our enviroment. An advantage of limiting cars could be that it lowers the amount of air pollution, which causes global warming. From Beijing to France, being as the most polluted cities in the world. Imagine the amount of smog and intensity that the people have to face, having gasoline being spewed on you. On the contrary, the city of Vauban being built in 2006. It has been a prime example of a glorious city without the needs of automobiles. Kids to adults living an prosperic life, riding bicycles or just taking a stroll down the sidewalk. The store is only a few blocks away, basically all you need is a pair of legs. The whole fault in our system is due to our lack of judgement. Having our malls or stores being built nearly miles away from homes, on paved roadways or highways. Obviously an automobile is needed, but this will only cause the major destruction of our enviroment. Limited transportation is when we really can tell if were able to stop this rapid growth of pollution. Our generation of kids and adults, thinks that a car is mandatory. But in reality, not every individual should own a car. From 2001 to 2009, the decrease of teens from the age sixteen to twenty one obtaining driver's license. Has dramatically declined, due to the realization of the amount of money they could save. From taking public transportation or car-pooling with friends. It could help them save money, rather than spending money on gas. Which could range from $1.50 to $4.20, depending on the circumstances. These kids or adults could use that amount of money saved for future plans. Their are more pros than cons when limiting the usage of cars. The people of Bogota, Colombia celebrate a day without any vehicles. All you can see, is the broad smiles of the people's faces and utterly shocking the most, is that the streets are busy with people rather than automobiles. Imagine if were able to do such a thing, the amount of stress that would vanish. Dealing with traffic or pondering your mind to the amount of gas you need. It would simply just vanish in a blink of an eye. If we were able to create vast systems of high tech highways to subways. Then we can manage to build programs or new forms of transportation. Without the hassle of using a vehicle, to spawning industrial factories where they are made from. An prime example is New York's recent bike-sharing programs and its skyrocketing tunnel tolls. The main priority of this creation is to lower the usage of cars. Being one of the America's highly populated and dense cities. The scale or outcome of this program of limiting cars, could decide the factor if changes are possible. Then if so, then this new system can be an advantage or an example of what we can do to lower our usage of cars. That creates the majority of air pollution across the entire face of this planet. In the end, the advantages of limiting cars or any form of transportation. Could lower the amount of air pollution, and the oncoming production of resources that affects our enviroment. But mainly create an atmosphere that will all humans alike to every single organism, to be able to live a prosperic life. Without the haze of dense smog, and stress of traffic jams. Thus, we can make or generate of new era of internal happiness."
6877,0,"""More Technology In The Classroom?"" Technology is catching up with society in every stage possible. Technology is reaching into our homes, transportation, jobs, and even eduacation, but what if technology takes a step futher into our daily lives, espcially education. The article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" is encouraging the idea of bringing in technology that could read the emotional expressions of students into a classroom. Although while many people may say ""no!"" because technology already has violated the daily lives of the children, it is a bad idea. However the pros of this argument are quite positive, the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it can make school less boring for students, it can help students learn the material in a easier way, and why not? Today highschool is diffrent to what it was a decade ago. If highschoolers from a decade ago visted the highschools of today with all the technology and advanced learning, they would love it. However the students of today don't love the highschools they're in today, it's all boring, old news. So how can we make today's kids be more intrested in school? Well by adding into the classroom (FACS) Facial Action Coding System that could ""recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". Using the same technology can make ""computer-animated faces more expressive-for video games or video surgery"". The use of this technology will make school so much more fun and intresting for students in all grading periods by using technology that will intrest them just like a videogame. The FASC will not just make school and the educating process fun but also easier. Many students have a hard time in school because they can't understand the material that they're learning in the classroom. A way to solve this issue that will make things easier for students will be by adding FASC into the classroom. In the article it stated ""it could modify the lessons, like an effective human instructor"". Every person in this earth is diffrent and learns at a diffrent pace than others, this is why the FASC is valuable in the classroom beacuse it can make education for that one student that is confused easier. Today in 2018 technology is all over the place that one can try to avoid it but most most cases one will fail, so it's easier to just say why not to the new technology that comes out every year. This is another reason why society should just allow FASC into our schools and classrooms. In the article it states ""computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face"" Technology has come so far that it can now construct faces. It is more likely that technology will only evolve with time and one will not be able to avoid it. So as a society we must just accept change and allow technology to evolve our homes, transportation and education. Today technology has come so far that we can not live without, so why say no to introduce FASC into our education. The use of this technology that is able read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it can make school less boring for students, it can help students learn the material in a easier way, and why not? This is just the era that we live in."

I mean for real we blame these things on creatures we have never even see or had phisical contact with? I feel this may just be a natural landform created by diffrent presures and wind levels in space. Maybe just like on earth how some of are landforms are formed, like rivers and things were formed by glaicers. The human mind takes things it has not seen before and relates them to things we are farmiliar with witch in some way allows them to assume the formation on mars ''resembles a human head''. Witch it dose to all human eyes because, this is what we have seen before and see all the time so thats what we relate it to. The day I see one. The day I see an alien then maybe I will refer back to the statement ""it was aliens'' and say the people that belive in them, were correct, but for now I am going to keep my answer solid with there are no aliens. Alot of things in this world that we have no answer for I just dont agree with blaming things on aliens its just not a logical exsplination. Many things in this world are very interesting and we have no exsplination or reasoning for,thats what keeps the mystery in alot of are everyday lifes and, allows people to make money off from the shows they suck us in to.So i feel we should just drop the aliens did this and that intell we acually have incounters that are proven with one. By all means i will except all the thereys then..But not now."
5559,0,"The use of the facial emotion recognizing things can help when kids are stuck on a problem or don't understand it. It may even help explain to a level they understand. It can help with how to teach someone and to read if they are understanding it, not just saying they do. They could even be more helpful outside of the classroom. When police take somene in for questioning they could have to computer read their face to see if they are nervous or lying. Instead of having a human give their opinion on what they think the person is feeling and giving the job to a computer, that was built to understand and read those things. It can help a lot with kids who lie and kids who need help and to get their own special level of understanding in thier education. To get things to be understood on a level for them. Not everyone learns the same and doesn't understand things the same way as others. Building this may help kids learn a lot better and give their teachers a better undertanding on how to teach them and what they need. What pace to take it at for that individual childs mind. To help understand better why certain kids are grasping at the subject they struggle in and help them. Maybe they understand it but it doesn't get their attention. The computer could possibly even help on that. It could help so many kids with grades. Could possibly slow the struggle with kids learning. Kids could learn in their own way at their own pace. Maybe not make them feel so scared and confused. The article stated that it read basic emotions, even a paintings emotions. They think it could help when kids get confused looks on their faces and give them help when needed instead of having to wait for a teacher who has to take care of more than one kid. Could change the way of explaining it to help them, sometimes they just don't understand the way it's explain as others might. The use of this technology could go far, even then could be able to be better with more work done. It may help a lot, in or out of the classroom."
966,0,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" it talks about Pros and Cons of landing a spacecraft on Venus. I think that landing a spacecraft on Venus is not something we should pursue because it all just seems like a waste of time. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author suggests that sturdying Venus is a worth pursuit despite the dangers in presents. The author supports the idea of Venus being a worth pursuit despite the dangers. In paragraph 5 he is claiming all of these things that wouldn't hurt humans like, ""a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly groud conditons by staying up and out of their way. At thirty-plys miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be plentuful and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions but survivable for humans"". I don't think that the Venus pursuit is worth because not only the dangers but the temperatures are also dangerous. In paragraph 3 it states that ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenherit and the atmospheric pressureus 90 times greater than what we expirence on Earth."" Also behind high pressure and heat, ""Venusian geology and weather presnt additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface. (Paragraph 3) I also think that even if we had a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet it wouldn't help much because in paragraph 6 is states that it can only provide limited insight on the ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. Also researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance therefore they don't have anything to analyze. I think that NASA should not waste their money to pursure something that we will not benefit from. We cannot land a ship on the planet let alone live on the planet. They are only wasting money and time and they could be exploring other things."

Some people ask how would that be fun, it would be fun because some people can't always go and see new place in the world that they have never seen and I say from the article Luke Bomberger was so excited to see new things like he went to China and he loved it he went to Venice, Italy and he loved it. My another reason was because all the stuff you could found out like is the great wall of china really great and does Italy food really good. So now you guys can really see how fun and amazing it is to be a Seagoing cowboy. I will give you 2 reason you should go, then I will explain them. First reason is because it is fun, Second reason is all the stuff you can figure out. Details about the first reason it is fun because all the cool stuff you can see. So one cool thing you can see is thegreat wall of China then is Italy food really good you can learn new stuff like new laugaues and bring back cool stuff and like is the great wall of China really great and like what the queen of Englad really look like. So now the second reason is all the cool stuff you could find out like how war zone really like after a war. What city you want to be saving up for. So now all of this brings me to my conclusion. Conclusion Be a seagoing cowboy could be fun and cool but its all about what you learn and doing the job that needs to be done so basically make sure you get those horse and young cattle and mules to the place they to be. if a friend offer you to go to another coutry or state go with them you will be amazed about what you would found Luke found a job that let him travel all over the world and that is that job any body could have."
18685,0,"The developmeant of driverless cars can be dangerous for our society. In 2009, Google made a car that could drive by itself, in certain conditions. These cars have been banned in certain states, it's against the law to test drive them in these states. How are we supposed to know how these cars do in other conditions if states have them banned for their states safety. Driverless cars can only assist us in driving not drive the car itself. In the 1950's. General Motors made a car that could drive on its own, on a special test track. This special test track was ""embedded with eletrical cable that sent radio signals to a reciever on the front end of the car""(Driverless Cars Are Coming). This Track could easily stop the car if needed, but we dont know how it would do out in the real world with other people. There are alot of sensors on the car. On Google's modified Toyata Prius, There are sensors on the left rear wheel, a sensor on the roof. a camera ner the rearview mirror, automotive radar sensors and a GPS. Sure having a lot of sensors on a carwould help the car pick up motion around it, but what if somthing happened to the car, one of the sensors broke out, the the car wouldn't be able to pick up movement around the car. BMW, a car manufactuer, developed ""traffic jam assistant""(Driverless Cars Are Coming). The car with traffic jam assistant can handle any driving function at 25 mph as long as the driver keeps their hands on the wheel. The car can steer by itself, which isn't safe because the car might see the need to turn itself in one direction and accidently hit a car. Based on its sensors, it need to steer left, but the sensor can be really sensitvie to any moverment. The car can accelerate and brake by itself also. The car alon can go faster when it doesnt need to or stop, either way it can cause a accident. The driverless cars movement needs to slow down and test its self more and more beforecoming out in the real world. The car relies on so much on its sensors or when it feels the need to switch back to giving the driver control. Driverless cars might seem pretty cool now, but wont when everyone starts to get one."

The electoral college has been made from our founding fathers in the constitution it shows a meaning, a meaning not only to us but also to The United states and in the most part its total strangers who pick these people its a political party it may seem unfair that the votes we are putting in is for the electors to run but its a show of value it shows the the electors get help with votes and so does the president just like it may be in the other side of the green grass as well. ""The Electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast""(pg22).

You might not be the mood for anything and the computer can tell when your bored or not feeling anything it will modify the way it work so you will be in a better mood i think its great. Beacuse kids might not fall asleep in class as much if thcomputer sees it and will fix it and it will help whats wrong with people. Part of me say its a bad idea becuase most people dont like talking about their emotions so that will make things worse if a computer does it and feel their emotions. Its pretty cool through how it can read your face and all 44 major muscles on your face. I would say no to it becuase i myself and like telling my emotions about things and dont a computer telling me about them

It may be the easiest way to get around but take the time out to think about the bad it cause. You wont be able to live some places because the wont have enough parking spaces. Where are you going to park? The diesel fuel you use to keep the car going pollute the air. Then we would have alot of bad air floatring around. Its also a problem to the traffic. Why not carpool, ride a bus, train, or bike? there are many different transportations in the world why just use one all the time? You see, cars may be the easiest way to get around but let's study some of the bad. One reason limiting cars is an advantage is because if you don't have a car 9 times out of 10 it would be easier for you to stay anywhere. Some homing areas doesn't have enough land to make an parking lot. So if you see somewhere you would like to live without an parking lot who would probably have to find somewhere esle to live. You can slove that by just getting rid of your car. I understand that getting rid of your car would probably be the hardest thing you have ever done but look at the bright side. You would be living in the place you want to be living in. Not only would it be easy to find somewhere to stay but also you wont have to worry about polluting the air with diesel fuel. Its crazy how you spend 3 dollars for an gallon of gas just to pollute the air. You would be better off just spending 3 dollars to catch an city bus or train.

With the information provied we can determind that the author gave enough reasons. For example ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything human encounter on Earth.""(para.3.) What its trying to tell us is that Venus is a planet in which in life is nothing close to ours. The planet is buring hot due to the fact it's closer to the sun. Explaining that life in Venus isn't possible human. Scientists take a big role, they are the ones that plan everything. The amount of time and effort placed into their work determines if we get to travel to Venus. For example ""scientists seeking to conduct a through mission to understand Venus would need to get uo close and personal despit the risks.""(para.6.) Getting up close and looking at the real thing there... standing in front of you, unsure on what to to do. Everything around you looking brand new, thats what the scientists want,, To be able to look at the Venus in person, the authour supports this claim by supporting deatil. After reading the passage I am able to infer the main idea, which was the author supporting his idea of Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers. The infernace I was able to capture,""human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally imtimidating endeavors.""(para.8.) This paragraph gives us the idea of us humans. We could be told one millions times not to do somehting, but at the of the day we all end uo doing it like it or not."
2575,0,"In the artical ""The Challenge of Expioring Venus"" the author wrote about how hard is to study Venus. He also wrote some information about it, like the other name for it which is ""Evening star"" and that it is the Earth's twin. He also talked about why it is hard to study Venus like, that it is too hot and you can't stay their for morethan few hours, he also said that Venus is the hottest planet which makes it so dry even if it is not the closest to the sun and the last thing that he said about Venus that it has more carbon dioxide than oxgen. Firstly, The main reason that Venus is so hard to study was because it is too hot which make humans not able to stay for a long time to discover it more. Venus ""temperature average is over 800 degree Fahrenheit."" and also it has pressure that is 90 times greater than what humans experienced on Earth. this is also the reason why no spaceship landed on Venus for morethan 3 decades. Not just that NASA also tried to find other ways to study Venus and know more about it. They usedelectronics made of silicon carbide and tested in c chamber simulating the chaos of Venus surface and because Venus is so hot and because of the other conditions it did not last for more than 3 weeks. Secondly, why the author said that it is hard to study Venus was because of the hard conditions that Venus has like that it is dry, high temperature and pressure, and that becuase of it is weather it has a lot of eruptings like, volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes.Venus has really fast changeable weather like it can change from earthquakes to volcanoes to other coditions. All of these different conditions can put humans in danger and they will not be in a safe place to live maybe they will have to keep going from place to other, but they eill not be safe to stay in one place for a long period of time. Lastly, why Venus is a really hard place to live or discoves is because of the carbon dioxide. Venus has almost 97 percent carbon dioxide which will made humans not able to live their because their is not enough oxgen in the atmosphere. Also Venus does not have any plantes or trees because of the different conditions, so their is no body is replacing the carbon dioxide with oxgen that all of the humans and animals use to live with. That why Venus is really hard place to discover or live on. Venus has a lot of conditins that make humans not able to land on for a long period of time. That is why the author wrote the arical about Venus so poeple can know why nobody has discovered a lot of things about Venus and why not a lot of people knows about it."
22225,0,"Dear Rick Scott, Controversial. This is the word that can describe the Electoral College in recent elections. The Electoral College is composed of 538 votes, a presidential candidate must acquire 270 to win the election. States with large populations get more electoral votes so say, Rhode Island. California gets 55 votes while the puny Rhode Island gets a whopping 3 votes. The Electoral College has been debated since the 2000 election, where Al Gore lost even though he got more popularity votes. Many folks believe the Electoral College should be abolished. I believe that the Electoral College should be kept in the presidential elections, because it shows a clear winner, it ensures it is, ""Everyone's President"", educated voters count in the swing states and it avoids Run-Off Elections. Without the Electoral College, some elections may be hard to decide a true winner. No matter the situation, the Electoral College will determine a winner, if the popular vote and electoral vote become tied, (which is highly unlikely,) the vote will be taken to the senate. Each senator counts as one vote, so no longer do bi states matter. Also, the Electoral College ensures the presidential candidates have trans-regional appeal. It makes the votes count, the president chose is surely, ""Everyone's President,"" rather than a favorite in just northeastern states. Furthermore, swing states are tremendously important to the outcome of the election. States such as Florida, New York, Texas and California have dozens of votes combined, winning all four of those states pretty much means presidency. The swing states not only have more electoral votes because of population, but because of their voters. On average, there are more educated voters in the swing states, they actually stay up to date, watch the news and know the means of each candidate. The Electoral College also avoids the disaster of which no cadidate receives a majority of the votes cast. A good example of this is when Clinton had only 43% of the popular votes won, yet he got a whopping 370 electoral votes, which made him president. The pressure of having a run-off election is nearly vanished by the Electoral College. Although others say that the Electoral College should be abolished, because in that system, voters vote a slate of electors, not the president. Well tough, the Electoral College ensures a winner, and that is all that matters. The Electoral College should, for sure, be kept in the Presidential Election system. It consists of 538 total votes, and 270 votes have to go to a candidate to pick a winner. Although the votes may tie up, which is nearly impossible, the Electoral College ensures another method to decide the presidency. The Electoral College produces a sure winner, ""Everyone's President,"" is elected, educated voters are in the swing states and it avoids the disaster of a Run-Off Election. From, PROPER_NAME"

Their is no proof that aliens exist on mars it could just be a ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" At times Earth's moon looks like a cheese ball but we know its not. If aliens were the cause of this wouldn't the sattelite catch that and it would be a verly long time for them to make it so big. It was also a cloudy time of year for the Red Planet. Meaning that the clouds could have been cover part of the rock to make it look like alien markings were on the rock. So clouds played a big role in this picture so their is no proof of alien life on Mars. I know you think aliens are on mars and they created the face on Mars. Its just not enough proof to say that there are. It was cloudy and certain landforms can build up to look like something. Also the latest digital image that was used, you would be able to see alot of small things."
17101,0,"I believe that driverless cars should not be built. They seem like a good idea at the first look but imagine there would be so many downsides to owning one of these vehicles. First of all they would be extremely expensive to build and buy and the delicate snesors used in these vehicles could easly be broken or damaged. Also people would have the ability to hack into the servers that would run these vehicles and essentially make them do whatever they wanted, whether it be to wreck or cause an accident. And what would happen if one of these vehicles were to malfunction and cause the death of a driver, passenger, or pedestrian. I feel there are too many risks and downsides to be producing these vehicles. Even if we were to make these vehicles mainstream and sell them people would find something wrong with them like they always do. And if not that they would find ways around safety measures added to the vehicles. For example preasure sensors could be added to the steering wheel to only allow the cars to drive if someone has there hands on it, but someone could just tightly wrap tape or something else around the wheel instead and cause an accident. This is why I think these vehicles should not be produced and sold."
20388,0,"The face on Mars was no created by aliens because there is no sign of life on the Planet and the images from Viking 1, MGS in 1998, and the MGS from 2001 suggest that the face on Mars is just a landform like we have here on Earth. The face on Mars is just a landform like you would find in the American West that was formed by the natural elements of Mars. There has been three images taken of the face on Mars and in all the face looks like it did in the first one just a little more clearer than the previous one in 1976 taken by Viking 1. If there was life on Mars there would have been evidence of life from the nomuraous amout of satilites and probes going past the planet. If life existed on Mars they would have to be able to beath the air on Mars and be able to melt the water in Marses polor caps in order to suvive, and they would have to be able to find means of substitains to be able to even live on Mars. NASA is a space institution that have tried to prove that there is life out there than just us and if there was other being out there in number of universes NASA would have found them. The people at NASA have the mind stength to be able to find other being and they have used it but they have yet to find extratuestrial life, if there was life on Mars one of the closest planets to us don't you think they would have found life if the was any on the planet. Mars is one of the planets that we have had rovers on don't you remember the Mars rover if there was life on the planet don't you think that it may have found it and took the time to take pictures and sent them back to Earth. If you still think there is or ever was life on Mars than you may have to wait till we are able to put people on the planet to find out if there was life on the planet and when that happens there may or may not be signs that there were. If there are signs that there was life on Mars than you were right but if there isn't than you were wrong and NASA was right."

First of all, the reason that I want to ask you this is because Most states have a winner take all system that they give to the winning president. Next, after presidential election, the governor prepares a Certificate of Ascetainnent. listing all of the presidents who ran for president. after the presidental election is heild every four years on a tusedayafter the first monday in vovember. you help chose your states electors. Furthormore, People should vote for a state of several Democratic electors pledged. On the off chance that those electors won the statewide election. oh yea and senitor under the eletoral college system, voters vote not for the president but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president. Finally, Fromm my opinion the presidental party selects a state of electors trusted to vote for the partys nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed. However, it is entirerly possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not winthe nactional popular vote. So Mr. senator sir im only asking you this one thing if u coud just keep the Electoral college or changing to election vote for the president of the United States. pleez thats all im asking from you to do for me just one thing. quite sime thing to do right.."

If you are looking for work, this would be an amazing job that will change your life forever. You will need to put in hard work and dedication, but this job is worth it all. Another reason to be a Seagoing Cowboy is that you will be doing a good service. You will be helping countries and the people inhabiting them. For example, ""To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals..."" This is a valid reason why you should join Seagoing Cowboys. Not a lot of people get the chance to help an entire nation by bringing them cattle, mules, horses, and food. If you are worried that you will not get any free time, don't be. You get to sightsee whenever you land in port and experience very amazing places and things such as the Acropolis in Greece, and taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. An excerpt from the article ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"" would be ""Besides helping people, you have the side benefit of seeing Europe and China."" Another benefit of being a Seagoing Cowboy is that it opens your eyes to needs in certain poor countries, or countries devastated by disaster. In addition to that, you have to put in a lot of hard work and dedication to feed and take care of the animals onboard the boat. But ""Being a Seagoing Cowboy is the opportunity of a lifetime."" That is why you should participate in the Seagoing Cowboy program. It is completely worth it and you will come back from this amazing experience more aware of what needs to be done to help people in other countries. Being a Seagoing Cowboy is a great opportunity that you will treasure for the rest of your life."
15374,0,"My position on driverless cars is that I think it would be a good idea. Considering how many car wrecks they're are in everyday life. The idea of driverless cars couldnt have came soon enough. Losing lives is a big thing on car craches. Car crashes come from humans silly mistakes now if the car can drive by itself no silly mistakes. Humans have an intendicy to not pay much of attention to the road like they ae suppose to. Humans get distracted easily by anything. Plus for Semi drivers that have to drive through the night for a delivery, that crash because they are tired wont have the problem of crashing because the semi could drive itself. Theyre would still have to be check ins but just the right idea is that there will be no more car wrecks. A big issue with car wrecks is drinking and driving and texting and driving. Yes the person still has a choice while intoxicated to get in the car or not and put down his destination but its better than him/her being in control of the vehicle.Texting and driving, well you wouldnt have to worry about it anymore because again the person won't be in control of the car. Those are some details that help support my position in this draft. Mainly for car crashes not people's needs. The death rate might go down some more if driverless cars were to come. It is something that society can't say no to."
8034,0,"Emotions the things that make us feel happy,sad,angryand scared. But they also show our humanity its difficult for people to understand one another and harder to know how one feels. But a new techology called facial action coding system enables computer to identify human emotions. I think its not right to determin if someone is happy or sad by using a machine. If a simple person can't figure out what emotions someone is feeling then i dont see why they'll trust a coding system that uses 44 muscle found in your face. To see if your feeling whatever emotion your feeling based on how your muscles where being used at the time of the scanning. For classroom use i see zero ways this can improve anything for students. Because students are emotionally unstable and there moods can switch at any given time. The artical also said something about imagine being infront of your computer and seeing an add the way you react to the add will make it so you don't see it anymore. I think its useless for a coding system to try and calculate how someone feels. The artical gives a great example ""you can tell how your friend is feeling simply by looking at there face"" this little fact made me think that both a human and computer can see your face and how both might say your sad or mad because of the way your face looks right then and there. But nether a computer nor human can trully know what that person feels inside of them. I dont see how anyone thought this coding system could benifit anyone let alone students. this coding system that can read human emotions might be fun but serves no use for a school. it might be really good for things like seeing how kids react to new toys or cereal before you make a product go on the shelves of stores. besides that this coding system is useless in my eyes."
16044,0,"Through out the world a lot of people are excited about the driverless cars that are being developed. However some of them fail to realize the negativities that come with this package. Not having to drive 24/7 would be nice, but at what price? Vehicles are not exactly the most reliable resource. While your car is in driverless mode what are you doing? You could be texting, eating, writing something down, or for heavens sake you could be sleeping! Drivers will become extremely wreckless, more so than they are now. They will go about thinking that the technology has everything under control. Forgetting that cars that require drivers have difficulties. Yet they will trust a car to drive itself and have no problem? The car you are driving could have miscalculations and make a turn where there is a building! When in a vehicle the driver makes commands whether to turn or to signal a turn signal. Now give the vehicle control and you are giving it control of your life and whatever passengers you have with you. The car is not perfected. It will most likely make countless mistakes. Technology failure being a main one. While you are texting or turned around the engine could die out or the brakes could go haywire. Your instincts will tell you to take the wheel and try to get it under control, what if the commands are inconclussive and won't respond. Who is to blame, the vehicle for shorting out or the driver for becoming too un-alert. Everyone has their own opinions, everyone has their own brain that allowes them to make the wrong or the right decission based on what they believe. Will you allow yourself to fall victim to awe or amazement and wonder at these new inventions. Or will you go over teh pro's and cons of becoming too reliant on the driverless vehicle and less aware of your actions while on the road?"

The author talks about different stuff how our sister plant is so inhospitable"". Scientists also see and search what's going on in the world and in the planets. I think it's good that we know some of these stuff so we know in the future that can happen. If you don't know none of these details you can search stuff online. It's also good knowing these stuff because it's better to know them. Scientists do a lot of researching that's going around the world and earth. Also Venus is worthy to know what dangercan happen. It can get to 170 degrees Fahrenheit the air will be close to the area. The solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed earth levels. Also says in paragraph 5 that's not easy conditions, but survivable for humans. Venus from a ship orbiting or havering safely far above. There is different facts about everything. For the last paragraph it should be about how the world is working now. In paragraph 8 striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus. There should be limits by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination. Imagine exposing the cellphone and all that."
19723,0,"I believe that depending on how the driverless cars are made, this could be an amazing achievement of technology. It seems that all or most accidents involve another person, plus the fault of the person that is driving. The drivers seem to be the problem of careless driving, which causes many wrecks, deaths, and insurance bills. Plus, the gas and pollution in the air is awful due to the use of so many cars. Driverless cars could be the answer to all of this. A big problem in our world today is pollution in the air. Trucks, cars, and taxis are the main factor in that because of the gas used. According to paragraph one, driverless taxis will help us to use less gas, and less gas means less pollution. Most people don't realize how much public transport is used everyday. Public tranport is even used in the smallest towns to help others get where they need to be. So, with less gas used in things like taxis and public transport, the air will be cleaner and the ecosystem will be less damaged. Another big problem is the fact that so many people are dying in car accidents everyday. Most of these accidents come from drunk drivers, or people who are just not paying attention. In paragraphs four it talks about how the driverless car was made to mimic the skills of human drivers. This paragraph also states that the car will be covered in sensors in order to prevent accidents. In paragraph seven it states that in the past a car was made where the driver had to stay alert in case it needed to be taken over. This paragraph also states that while the driver watched the road, the car watched the driver. This would also lead to less accidents. Now a days we also find people falling asleep at the wheel, or people becoming bored of driving during long periods of time. Driverless cars could also help with that. According to paragraph eight, drivers could potentially get tired of waiting to drive in driverless cars, which would mean they'd fall alseep. In case of an emergency they would need to be awake in order to take over. This seems like it would be no problem because; these driverless cars would be set up with displays that would show you something interesting, then turn off if you needed to take the wheel. This is something that can keep you awake on the road, while also keeping you safe. This car is one of the many steps in the right direction people can take in order to have a safer future. The fact that the car has sensors that tells it where everything around it is positioned, is an amazing safty precaution. It is also great that there will be less pollution due to this new innovation. Another amazing achievement is how the kids and adults will be entertained, while staying alert for an emergency. All of these reasons sounds like a great idea to continue the research into driverless cars."
21172,0,"Thick clouds of black smoke, and the smell of gasoline fills the air. Everytime you breathe it's like your breathing poison. It's in your lungs and you cant get it out. This is our society today. Some people think that this issue is not a big deal, but in fact it is. But where is all this polution coming from? The answer is simple, cars! Cars are the second leading poluter, in America. What these cars are doing are releasing a poisonous smog into the atmosphere, and we breathe it. Its not only killing us though, oh no. It is killing our one, our only, Earth. We are killing the only thing the human race has to live on, and for what? So we can save a couple minutes to get to work? This needs to stop. Why continue to use cars when thier are so many more advantages not to use them? Without cars, or limiting the number of car usage we would save billions of dollars a year, be much more further into technology, and not only be saving lives, but saving our Earth. How much money would you say you spend on gas a week? Doesn't seem like all that much right? Now add the same thing again, and again, and again. By now you are probably in the hundreds. Now picture yourself with all of that in your hand. Thats all the money you have spent on something that is gone in almost an instant. Think about all the things you could buy with that money. Sounds nice right? Well why don't you just make it a reality than? You could save hundreds in hundreds of dollars in as little as one month! You could save even more by not even buying a car! than you'd be saving a ton of money. Plus youd be doing yourself a favor. You dont need to pay for gas, insurance, repairs or even the car. This is what people in not only America are doing but also in Columbia, Bogota, and one of the worlds most beautiful cities in the world, Paris. These people are bettering themselves, and thier country. ""All of our world development since world war II has been sentered on the car"" said David Goldberg in the article In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars. Just think about how much more advanced of a society we could have without cars. So many things could be created that could save lives! A cure for cancer, a solution to end world hunger, new electronics, maybe even ways to reach past the ridges of our galaxy, yet somehow we still put our focus on something that is killing us, and the Earth. Sure theres some cool tech in these new Automobils but, the only reason people by cars are for new features, or better mpg, or as said by Mr. Sivak in The End of Car Culture, ""A car is just a means of getting from A to B"", but thats all people really buy new cars, or use them for. If we wernt so focused on cars we would have new, and improved technology, and a lot more life changing discoveries. The Earth is dying. We are killing it, and ourselves. How much gasoline can your tank hold? the real question is how much gasoline can we put into the air we breathe? This smog and polution is destroying some of the most beautiful scenes on earth. Paris, New York, and Bejing. However the usage of these automobils are not only killing us with polution, but with auto accidents. So many of Americans have lost thier lives due to wrecks, crashes, common stupidity, and deffects in the car itself. Whats even more sad is a lot of the time the person who has lost thier life is not even at fault. A lot of times when driving people tend to get stressed out. road rage is a dangerous thing. In fact Heidrun Walter exclaimed his opinion on the subject by saying ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" in the article In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars. A very, very effective solution to this problem is to ultimitly rid them from society. A simple distraction, a buzz, beep, ring, or crash, cound end up fatal, to anyone, and everyone who gets behind the wheel. Global warming, cancer, deathes, stress, and injuries, these are all things caused by vehicles. A common thing we all learn at a young age is to eliminate the problem at the source, and change starts with you, the reader, the average civilian can make a higher than life impact on society. Don't under estimate the power each individual holds when making a difference for good. Simple things like car pooling, walking, riding a bike, or public transportation, can all make a difference, for the better. so lets do it! lets make our environment cleaner. Our futures brighter, and our lives safer. Together we can acomplish this! we would have the advantages of saving billions of dollars a year to use for bigger and better things, be much more further into technology, and not only be saving lives, but saving our Earth, on our side."

In source 2 ""Paris Bans driving due to smog ""After days of near-record pollution, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. In this incident, Paris enforced a Ban on cars so it can clear up the polluted air with somg in the city.

In the article ""What is the Electoral College "" author ""The Office Of The Federal register"" it proclaims "" You help choose your state electors when you vote for president because when you chose your canditate you actually vote for your candidates electors.

Another reason why the electoral college should be changed into popular vote is because each has a diffrent amount of electors. If you thought not being able to actually your president was wrong, but what about your state having fewer or more electoral votes,and thats the deciding factor on if your candidate wins. Author of the "" The Indefinsible Electoral College"" Pulmer states ""at the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voter, because of the winner-take -all system in each state,candidates dont spend time in states they know thaey hace no chance in winning"". The electoral college should be done away with imediately not only is the democratic system is not so democratic, but its not letting the peoples voice be heard.

5052,0,"In the article ¨Making Mona Lisa Smile¨, the autor talks about a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System. This new piece of technology will help advance schools by recognizing the students facial actions, telling whether not a student is lying, and it could make class more interesting. Since the Facial Action Coding System can read emotions, it could possibly help the students´ woth thier emotions. In paragraph 3, it states ¨Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness-and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles.¨ With this new technology, it is able to detect if a student is more sad than happy, or if they are more angry than sad. It is also able to dectect if a student is fearful. This will be able to help students, because if a student is fearful for a test, quiz, or anything in general, it will be able to notice that and tell the teacher or guidance counsler and they will help the studentto the best of their ability. This will help the teachers understand their students better, and possibly be able to help the student. Adults say kids and teens are lying a lot more nowadays. With the Facial Action Coding System, it will be able to detect if that is true or not. In paragraph 8, it states ¨...these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ´smiling´ politician or celebrity isn´t being truthful.¨ If FACS technology is able to dectect a lie just in someone famous´ face, then why not in students? Principals will be able to use the FACS technology to catch if a student is lying, and then the principal is able to come up with a solution to possibly get the truth out of the student. FACS will also bring more honesty to schools, since they will be able to detect lying. What is the point of lying when the student is just going to get caught anyways? Also, FACS will be able to detect if teachers are lying. Teachers lie sometimes, and they are also able to lie to their bosses. With the FACS technology, it will make more honest people out of teachers and students. Let´s face it, class is sometimes boring. Teachers are not always able to determine whether the subject is interesting or downright a lulubye for students. With the FACS technology, it is able to decide whether the subject or lesson is interesting to students. In paragraph 6, it states ¨For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad will appear. But if you frown, the next ad will be different.¨ The FACS computer is able to tell whether the subject is boring or not. If a student is frowning, then they may not be interested in the topic, nd the teacher may not always see the student frowning. If a student is smiling, then the student is interested in the topic and will most likely engage in the topic and ask questions to better understand what the teacher is saying. Say the FACS technology tells the teacher that their way of teaching is making the students sleepy, then the teachers could come up with ways of making the lesson more interesting to the students. The teachers could find new ways to present the lesson in a way that the students will find more fun, eye-catching and memorable. The new methods will be able to keep students awake and actually take in what the teacher is trying to teach. The new methods could also help the students remember what they were taught, since it was fun for them. In conclusion, the new Facial Action Coding System technology will help advance schools by recognizing the students facial actions, telling whether not a student is lying, and it could make class more interesting."

A few days later we had unvellied this for all to see. then after that we went back into spacae. we found that most would not be happy about what we had seen.we flew over Cydonia for the first time. there was clods so we couldnt get a good look at first. its not easy to get a good look at them. One of my good partners had said that. in fact he said it is very hard to. but dont worry never the less on a cloudless summer day on the red planet we got a good look. we had captuerd a good photo. we had only one second to captuer it and we did it pretty well. this pictuer was a 3 times biger. This means if there where any objects or planes or egyptian style things on the ground we would have seen them. so with all of this testing it turnd out to be just antihor land mark. so this means that the scientist that thought that the alliens made it where wrong and i have proven that they where."
7726,0,"I believe that the use of this technology would be valuable to use in a classroom full of students. I believe this because instructors must know what their students emotions are like toward the subject being taught. For example, let's say a students emotion is bored, the taecher would then know what his students emotion is like. The instructor may be able to give a 2 to 5 minute survey to his students based on what he can do to improve his teaching skills. Which would therefor give his students a better environment to work. The prompt explained a somewhat new computer software that could recognize emotions. It explains what the software can do and how it works. 'The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like a human muscle. Movement of one or more muscle is called an ""action unit.""'(D'Alto), this quote talks about how it reads ones face emotion. Which brings us to a students emotion and how its read. This is where it is valuable, 'But if you frown, the next ad will be different. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming counfused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human insstructor.'(D'Alto). This is where it is valuable this software, it will be able to tell an instructor their students emotion toward the subject and how they'll be able to improve/modify the lesson. With this software many instructors would be able to improve on their lessons. Thanks to Prof. Thomas Huang and his colleage many students would be able to focus on their lesson and not be bored again. This is why I believe this technology would be a valuable use in a classroom full of students."
7511,0,"Emotions are important factors in many things that people view in today's world. People feel emotions while watching movies, playing games, or even just when having private thoughts. One feels emotion due to the situation they are present in. If a technology can change whatever the person is viewing to something they are satisfied with, that would be great. If the technology is capable of reading a stundent's facial expression to improve upon something, it would be very useful. Using technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuabel due to how it can assist in the students' learning if they are confused and ensure that all students are feeling comfortable in the school environment. It is not unusual that a student can get lost in the middle of a lesson or even feel as the lesson is too simple for him or her. It is important though that steps are taken to resolve the issue that the student is having and offer them the right help. If technology can assist in figuring out whether a student needs help or not, then it is very valuable to a class. In the text, the author states that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" which displays that the computer can greatly aid the student. If the teacher realizes that a student is confused, the teacher can then go help the student so he or she is no longer lost. The teacher can also make the lesson tougher or more rigorous if a student is becoming too bored. The significant usefulness of the computer displays how such technology can be very valuable to a classroom. Another very valuable reason to have the technology to read facial expression in a classroom is that it can tell when a student is sad or in fear. Being in a safe environment is critical to a student in order to be able to learn without worrying about anything else. It is claimed that the technology, ""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks...facial movements,"" which can be very easily used to recognize when a student is feeling fearful or sad. It is significantly important that the technology can do such thing due to how the text claims that ""Most human communication is nonverbal, inlcuding emotional communication,"" which displays that a student will not most likely inform his or her teacher when he or she are feeling as if they are in danger or if they are sad. Also, the student would not learn as well as he or she would if they are not feeling safe in the classroom. This important use of the technology makes it very valuable to have in a classroom to recognize the facial expressions of the students. These couple of reasons display why having a technology that can read facial expressions of students in a class is valuable. It would be great if it actually does happen in the near future. It would provide assistance to both the students and the teachers by making the right lessons and by ensuring the comfort of everyone within a class. There is already a lot of technology used in classrooms daily to make the students' and the teachers' lives much easier and ensure their success. Using technology to tell the students' emotions can significantly improve upon that process. Overall, the use of technology to improve upon a process is usually a good thing, specially when it aids students and teachers improve classroom experience."

To many people I'm sure the thought has occured. It seems like such a simple concept, a car with no driver being capable of driving itself, but it isn't. I don't think that driverless cars are the best idea for the world today. I don't think the world is quiet ready to fully grasp the concept of a 100% driverless car. Yes, we have been aware of the concept of a driverless car since 2009 thanks to Google, but I don't think our nation, espically the US because of our very high debt, is in a good enough state to introduce something like the driverless car. Being a teenager in high school, I personally enjoy driving places by myself, so the idea of a fully driverless car simply dosen't apeal to me the way it would to an older man or woman who can't drive well or drive at all. Also, I think it would be a big problem determining who is at fault for the accident when one occurs, the person in the autonomous car or the company who made the car that was responsible for accident. Not knowing who is responsible seems like a lot to worry about, possible lives could be at stake if the wrong choice is made. Cars without a real human driver might be an intertaining thought but I feel they will be very dangerous more often than safe. It is impossible to program a car to have human abilities. The skill and saftey of a human driver would be nearly impossible for anyone to replicate. Driverless cars would hurt our nation more than it would help."
6975,0,"Have you heard of the Facial Action Coding System, also known as FACS? It is technology that can identify human emotions, such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disguist, and surprise. This would not be useful in school classrooms on students for many reasons, but it could still be valuable in some situations at school. To begin, one reason the FACS wouldn't be useful to use on school students is because school is for getting an education and learning. School is not for figuring out whether a student is happy or sad, so for that reason the FACS would not be useful. Also using the FACS on students, would take up time and waste it, when students could be learning, which is what they should be doing in school. So basically, the school should be focused on education students, and not trying to tell their emotions using technology. Secondly, the FACS would not be useful because some students may not want it to be used on them. Students don't need a technology to show what emotion they are feeling, when the student their self knows what their current emotions are, and if the school used the FACS it would be a waste of time for the students who didn't need to, want to, or disagree to using the FACS. Also some parents could disagree and not want the school the use the FACS on their students in the school. On the other hand, using the FACS could be valuable. For example if a student is being bullied it would be useful to use in a situation like that. Also it would be useful if a teacher was trying something new in the classroom, and the teacher could see whether her students were happy or not with it. The FACS could also come in handy and be useful and valuable, in acting or drama classes. The FACS could be used to tell how good students are at acting out emotions. In conclusion, using the Facial Action Coding System ( FACS ) can tell emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger,surpise, disguist, and fear. The FACS wouldn't be that valuable at school, because some students may not want others to know their real emotions, and also using the FACS in school would not be valuable because school is for education and learning, not for figuring out emotions. Although the FACs could be valuable to use in school in drama or acting classes to tell how good or bad students are at acting out certain emotions in which they aren't currently feeling."

You should join the program because,you can have fun, save animals,and more. And I think you should because,you can be a leader,and a really special person to many people. Also it can teach you to be brave and believe in yourself. One more thing,it can be a lot of work,but it is worth it. To support the reasons why you should join I will give you some examples from the passage. In the passage it says,It was 1995,World war ll was over in Europe, and may countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover their food supplies,animals,and more,44 nations joined together to form UNRRA,that helpes to support the claim you can save many lives. Also in the passage it says,""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China, and that helps to support the claim that you can experience adventures and visit many unique places. In the passage it says,It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the Unites States and a month to get to china. Caring for the animals during the crossing kept Luke busy. They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holdsof the ship. Stalls had to be cleaned. This helps to support the claim that,it can be a lot of work, but it is worth it. So if you are thinking about joining good,and I thank you. If you are not interested it is okay. Some people might have their own opinion about things. Some may think that is cool,I want to join the group. And others may think that is not the right job for them,or it seems boring. But whatever you are thinking about doing just do it.And that was my introduction to my essay."
23870,0,"""Pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" Owning a vehicle helps get people from one place to another faster then just walking but some people really don't understand that there are advantages to not owning a vehicle. In the excerpts ""In German Suburb, life goes on without cars"", ""The end of car culture"" both by Elizbath Rosenthal and ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, all explain how limiting car usage can help lower emission and conserve resources. In the excerpt ""In German Suburb, life goes on without cars"" by Elizabeth Rosenthal explains why limiting car usuage would help lower emissions. For example, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. Cars are polluting the eniviroment that we all live in and are destroying the atomosphere because of all these greenhouse gases swirling through the air because of the use of cars. Furthermore, referring to another excerpt ""The end of car culture"" from Elizabeth Rosenthal also, proves why limiting car usuage will lower emission rates. For instance, ""What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down to two to three years before the turndown...it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviroment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants."" As you can see owning a car can be a advantage to your personal life but the enviroment is suffering because of the fumes from the vehicles everyone own but if less people start to walk more, ride bikes or even hike the enviroment wouldn't be suffering from so many emissions. Likewise, in the excerpt ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer highlights how limiting car usage can help conserve resources. For example, ""After days of near-record polution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city...[The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world...Cold night and warm days caused the layer of air to trap car emissions."" Going back to what Rosental was pointing out emissions are still triggering the atmosphere. But, that is not the only thing that is being blamed for pollution. ""Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has...[a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in Western Europe, accoring to Reuters."" Without any gasoline nobody will be traveling from one place to another so to conserve resources people are better off limiting the usage of their cars. In conclusion, using cars less would help to lower emissions and conserve resources such as in this case gasoline. If everyone keeps driving aroud in cars the air is going to be full of Greenhouse gases and eventually resources to run cars will soon run out. Then without a car to take people where they need to go people will have no choice but to walk, ride a bike, or take public transportaton because everything id worn and ran out. This is why limiting car usage is a advantage for fellow citizens because it helps lower emissions and conserves resources."

Having a car can bring lots of tense and responsibility along with lots of money having to be spent. In (Source 1) it states that ""When i had a car I was alwayse tense. I'm much happier this way,"" Car ownership require lots of of money to be spent on the car,on a garage and even a parcking space. In (Soure 1) it states that ""Germany car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park-large garages at the edge of the development,where a car-owner buys a space,for $40,000, along with a home"". An advantage from limiting your car usage would be to make the cities denser, and better for walking. In (Source 1) it states that ""While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs""."

""All of our developement since World War II has been centered on the car, and that needs to change."" says David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America. The question every pereson who is legal to drive ""How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.

Passengers cars are responsible 12 percent of greenhoudse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. In the United States the Enviormental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a larger part in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport. Next, After days of near-record pollution, paris enforcd a partial driving ban to clear th air of the global city. Motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leve their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to the odd-numbered plate sthe following day. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined according to the international news agency(Reuters). Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France,after five -days of intsensifying somg. Diesel fuel was blammed, since France has a tax policy theat favors diesel over gasoline. Paris typically ahs more smog than other European capitals. Las week Paris had 147 microgramsof particulate matter. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday. The somg cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party rescined the ban for odd-numbered plates on tuesday. Last, Recent studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licensices as each year goes by. That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question ""Has America passed the peak of driving?"" America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. The United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter. As of April 2013, the number of mile driven per person was nearrly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in the year 1995. Inconclusion all of the less car usage is being used all across the globe. Things like this are good to keep up."

With these questions to be answered are we ready for this? There are a lot of good things and bad things about this. With these companies ready to show the future of cars. Do they have it completely down? Let me tell you what I think of this. There are a lot of pros and cons of this thought on future cars. When we think of future cars we thing of cars that can fly in the air and don't have to use the road and do not have any wheels. Just something keeping them in the air. But companies thought of what if you did not have to drive the car. One of these companies is Google. My opinion on this invention is it is to dangerous. It also defeats the purpose of learning Drivers Education and leaning how to drive. If your gonna learn how to drive on the road you should be able to drive on your own not have a computer drive for you while you watch in the drivers seat. If the car was driving on its own then there would be no way you can sharpen your skills on driving if your not driving. What if the car had a malfunction? The car just stops in the middle of the road or takes you off the road or even you do not have any control over the car anymore when you are in danger. These questions need to be answer before having a car like it on the road because being on the road is risk. It can end up hurting multiply of people or ending lives of people. If Google finds a way to work it out what tells you other companies would not try to figure out how they did it. I feel like if we have cars like these on the road we can really mess up the rules of the road. If cars were like this then we might as well call it a taxi. If you get a driverless car would the person in the car have to have a license. In this article it says that the car will warn the driver and have them take over sometime if it is dealing under certain circumstances like pulling out of driveways or dealing with traffic. What if the driver becomes lazy or falls a sleep. Is the car gonna figure out how to pull out of a parking lot or manuver traffic? These questions are the ones that if not figured out can really hurt someone or people on the road. The pros of this tho is thgat less gas would be used and the driver does not have to drive. I understand that the future is approching us but without the right stuff for the production then it does not need to be released to the public. These are my opinoins on this product. I hope the questions I put in here can be answered and shown in a test drive but if not then does not need to be used. I understand the future is coming, which means more technology and more stuff thats spouse to blow your mind, but with more technology does not meant to put peoples life at risk with products that can go crazy."

Driving is a very common thing in the United States of America, almost every adult in todays society drives. If driveless cars become normalized then think about the people who can't afford drivless cars. The law would have to change so what would happen to the old car drivers. Would they have to follow the new ''Drivless'' laws or the old ones that where set? The law system would get very confusing ans would be hard on police oficers. A big problem would be accidents. Who would you charge, the manufactures or the driver? You wouldn't know who's fault it would be. Since Sometimes the cars drive by there selves it could be either one. The compunies have the money so even if it was a cars fault the cumponie would get out of the Law suit and could leave the driver paying a lot for something that wasn't his/her fault. The biggest concern is safty. What happens when the car gets glitchy or if a circut goes out and the car starts to panic and crash. The children could get severly injured from something that wasn't your fault. The car is almost aslways based on a computer sytem. People in todays society are smart and know how to work computers. Would the car have a firewalll of some sort. If not there could be lots of trouble if somme one was deranged and haked a car a ran it into stuff blowing things up. with the knew teroist coming up people need to think about things like that. That could be the next attack using our cars to strike fear into people. Then we couldnt tell who or where it came from. In the end i do think Drivless cars could work i just don't think they're ready for use in the forseable future. they need alot of work and alot of explaining before the cars can be usable or to be common in society. So could it work of course, but I don't see it happening any time soon."

9120,0,"Do you think a programmed computer can actually decipher the emotions of a human being? What about a painting? Can technology deciphering an emotion help our students in their classrom? In today's modern day life technology is used everywhere for everything. Technology seems to excel and expand everyday. We are even up to the point where we have robots working and talking as humans. Even in student classes. Most books are being outdated to computers. Books could be found on line and test can be did online. But could a computer really anayze a student's feelings. The thing is, robots and machines have no emotions. So how would they be able to distinguish a student's emotions, or better yet, a painting's emotions. Even though technology has no emotions, it could decipher a student's emotions through movement of muscles, facial expressions, and emotion recognition software and be very valuable to students in a classroom. Technology or computers can recognize an emotion through your muscles. According to paragraph 3, the process of calculating emotions of a human or painting begins with first uploading a 3-D model of the face. The next step would be to compare the picture with muscles, the picture must move like human muscles. After, technology would relie on facial actions through the FACS, or Facial Action Coding System, to figure out facial movements. The FACS has classified six basic emotions and has associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. With the muscle movement clarrified, the system could connect each facial expression with a movement. And with the new emotion- recgnition sdtware, the software could identify emotions. Thsi could help students in the class by a computer knowing when the student is bored with a lesson or if the student can't concentrate due to tiredness. Although technology can upgrade and use software to decipher's a student's emotions, technology can still be wrong, malfunction, and shutdown on students. A computer is based off of malware, numbers, and software and humans relie on them all the time. Sometimes computers can overwrite or miscalculate signs and give people the wrong expression. The computer can even shutdown completely. But just as a computer could be wrong, so can humans. Humans use calculation everyday. As the example used in paragraph five, we could tell if something is wrong with one of our friends by the look on their face, but most of us would have trouble describing their facial trait. In conclusion, technology can decphier a human's emotions and can be valuable in a classroom. As technology upgrades, students could be able to learn more with the help of computers. Teachers would know whether a student is able to understand the lesson all due to a computer. They also would be able to know if a student is bored or just struggling. This is how technology, being able to read emotional expressions of students, can be valuable."
23111,0,"Dear Mr. Senator, The way the voting is now in the United States needs to be changed. It should change from Electoral College to popular vote. The voting system is an all or nothing system which means lots of peoples votes would not count for the president they want. If the voting system changes the president would actually be picked by the people and not by a group of people who won the popular vote. The electoral college is unfair to many people because their vote goes to waste if the other slate of electors won. In Source 2 it says ""On the off-chance that those electors win the statewide election, they would go to Congress and... would get... electoral votes."" That is saying that part of the votes would not count because the other group won and not the one they wanted to win. So then the president will get a certain number of electoral votes based on the population of that state. Some people feel like their votes are not needed as much because if the majority of that state chose the other candidate. The electoral college is a good idea, but people can betray the trust of others. In Source 3 it says ""...each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee..."" That means the voters have the ability to vote for the other candidate. If someone decides to vote for the other candidate then some peoples votes will have been for nothing. If we had the popular vote voting system then everyones vote would go to the specific candidate, and people would not have to hope the person they slate they pick has everyone pick the candidate they were trusted to vote for. In the end the voting system of the United States is built on trust. If we have the popular vote voting system everyones vote would go to the candidate that wanted it to go to and not have their vote be wasted on a slate that may or may not win. With the popular voting system the president would win on popular vote and not electoral vote; therefore, the president could not cheat his way to power by targeting big states."

I understand that we need to better our ways of public transportation, but many dangers come with driverless cars and I think that the risks are just not worth it. One negative effect with driverless cars is so far, they do not have the ability to detect when road conditions change from the noraml like road work, traffic jams, or accidents that recently occure. The next major danger of these cars is people's lives could be the effect of an error with the manufacterers. Another aspect is most people who have been driving on their own for a while may not feel comfortable with giving up control to technology. Having driverless cars would take a lot of trust in this technology and that may be a hard thing to accomplish. Driverless cars may not have a positive effect on today's world. Putting people in situations that are extremely risky is not worth being able to sit back and relax while technology is controlling you. The world is modernizing and technology is in practically everything we do, but we have to be focused and in control because putting too much trust into technology that could posibly have faults can become a safety hazard."

Which people wonder, if studying about Venus worthy?. On how dangerous it can also be living on Venus. Which will figure how the author supports his idea. One way the author can support his idea is Venus is the closest planet to earth terms of density and size.Which makes sense because it is the closest planet to Earth as of today. Also referred to Earth's twin,even tho it's thick atmosphere is 97% covered of carbon dioxide. Venus has it's high pressure and the hottest surface temperature of any planet.Which makes it difficult to visit the planet due to the extreme conditions. Venus may had once have been Earth-like planet in our solar system because it had eath like features. With large oceans and form of life due to the leftovers on the planet it has. But the planet still has valleys, mountains, and craters. So scientists could say that the planet was like earth many years ago. But no sort of life can no longer live on the planet as of now. NASA has been trying to find an idea on how to send humans to Venus so they can study the planet more. Which they are trying to find the idea on how to study the planet without needing to touch the surface, but to float about the fray. But would need to find a way with the air pressure of the planet since it is relatable to the sea level.Once they do land on venus they will know way more about Venus then they already do. In conclusion studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents is very worthy. How Venus is the only planet closest the Eath. But is also one of the most dangerous condition planets to land on. Which is obvious how the author wants us to study about Venus because is so much to know about the planet. Which can teach a student alot, just by reading an article."

With the Electoral College, your voice isn't really heard. Votes should be counted individually and America will get the president that they really want. For starters, there was a situation back in 2000 where Al Gore won the popular vote but didn't become president. That my friend, is unfair. The Electoral College doesn't really prove who actually won. Although, the incident happens back in 1880, I don't think it should happen again. Most of America wouldn't really think of the president as the president. I must admit, the Electoral College is a quick way to send in the votes on election day but it isn't efficient. Like stated in paragraph 10, voters don't vote for the president, but for the state of electors. The electors are basically anyone who isn't holding office. State conventions, state party's central and presidential candidates can pick the electors. Votes can't always control whom their electors vote for which why you should get rid of the Electoral College. Plus it's a dumb name. Another reason why is because the people of this country will be pissed if another Gore vs Bush situation happens again. Electors are really in control, therefor if they dislike who's running against their political party they have a shot at voting for whomever they want. That's unjust, and frankly unfair. Especially if a huge state is at risk. One counterclaim might be that the Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves the majority of votes cast. I don't want to vote and wonder if my voice will be heard. I want it to be guarunteed because that's what the United States is all about. It's all about us being able to choose the president. The Electoral College is unjust and is a waste of time. If you guys decide decide on letting us elect the president by popular vote, more young adults will start voting and we'll know out voices are heard."
