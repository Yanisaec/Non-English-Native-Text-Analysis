2694,0,"Humans have been always against risky situations, but those who have abandoned their fears have, at least, succeed. So, I think that the spirit of fighting against yourself is one of the most important qualities you could have.

First of all, if you don't progress, you will be always at the same level, you won't reach for higher positions. Unless, you are happy with this situation, this won't be a problem, but in my case this would be a disaster, because I always think the way of getting better until the perfection and I think that is the feeling that moves the world. You only have to remember every morning that if it hasn't been for Cristobal Columbus, that decided to take a new route to the West Indians, probably now we would be not learning English. 

Second, if you get used to doing some process or task that everybody is able to do, then you became one of them. But in the moment that appears somebody who could do it better than you, then you get replaced. You are dismissed. For example, if you work in a company that has just stablished in China, and you are the first who learn Chinese, then the next that come behind you, won't be able to pass through you.  

And at last living the same kind of lifestyle could be very boring, in the sense that you sink into the routine and it becames very difficult for you to go on since you don't have incentives. 

To sum it up, riskless way of living is not permitted for me, because you have to be self confident of your possibilities and try to use them in the most efficient way in order to prevent yourself of the attack of the others and then you will reach your own limits."
1633,0,"I think that a successful person is more focused on trying new things rather than doing what he or she already knows well. Infact a successful person is a person who wants  to make the difference. Let me explain. A successful person is a person who wants to be different from other people; he /she wants to have some characteristics that can make him/her special in front of  all  other normal people. To do that, a succesful person has to try new things and not only to do what other people do every day. The history shows us many examples of men a women that have changed the world by trying new things. I'm talking about inventors that, by doing new things, has introduced some important innovations. These men and women had taken a lot of risks by doing that. The inventor that I admire most is Marie Curie, who developed the x rays technology. X rays technology is very important today . However, Marie Curie died because of intoxication caused by the big amount of X rays that she absorbed. Without her sacriface, today we would't have one of the most important instruments to diagnose deseases and illness.
However, I have to say  that a successful person is a person that is able to take some risks only when risks are proportionated to the benefits carried by doing new things. Only a stupid person can take some big risks without  the possibility to get some bigs benefits.
For example, managers and brockers, who are the main actors of the financial world, try new things; for example they try to invest money and time in new areas of the world or in new technologies. They do thatt only when the risk connecetd to the financial operation is  as big as the return of money waited."
4792,0,"Wether it is better to have a broad or a specific knowledge depends esentialy of the point of view : if you are looking at the society general interest or at the individual interest.

Eficiency is one of the main argument in favor of knowledge specialization, because it is certainly harder to master a great variety of topics than to focus on a narrow topic. Specialization is one of the main reasons of the great achievements of modern Science.  Today's scientists are capable of very complex theories and projects because they are all very specialized. A botanist would not mix with quantics, because he would loose some time in getting the basis, whwn he could have developed a little further a study on a peculiar animal behaviour.
So for Science and more widely for the human race specialization is better.

But as human being and individuals we need equilibrium which is achieved only throught a wider horizon of knowledge. If your goal is self fulfillement then you will be better of knowing a large panel of topics. That is why during our elementary and most of our secondary studies we are studying a large panel of fields in order to get a solid background on which people can build their minds. 
And it is valable even in the scientific world, when some of the most extrordinary discoveries have been made throught interdisciplinar studies. Like mixing ordinary chemistry with biology  you discover the extraordinary possibilities of using one to dicover more of the other.  You  can dicover some intresting molecules in some animals or plants and you can better understand how the brain works if you know chemistry.

I will end this essay by saying that a solid background of knowledge is necessary, and only then you can specialize in your own field."
8725,0,"There are a lot of people, most of them young people, who say that young people enjoy life more than older people do, but is it truth? Well, to be honest I agree. I think young people enjoy life a lot more that older people do for the following reasons. 
    In first place, young people are experimenting everything that older people already did. They have more energy and fisically they are able to do, what sometimes older people can't do. 
    Older people is most of the time tired or in bad mud and they don't want to do anything. I'm not saying that all of them are like that but most of them sometimes become angry people and they live their lives so. Instead young people is ancious to live their lives and to have the experiences older people had. 
    For example, I'm a young person and I think I have such much more fun than my parents do! It is obviuos. That's because they have a lot of responsabilities and a lot of things to worry about. But for me is a lot different, because I don't have kids, I don't have to work and I don't have to worry about anything, but the school and doing my homework. I can do a lot of things they can't, for example I can watch TV on the afternoon all the time I like but my parents have to go to work so they can't or I can go out on the weekends with my friends but some times it's impossible for my parents to go out with their friends. And I think that all these things make that some persons become like that. Of course with all those things they can't enjoy life like young people do.
    So that, these maybe some of the reasons why people say that and in my opinion it's truth."
770,0,"From my point of view it is more important for the student to learn the facts and then start learning the ideas and the concepts .student must know the facts before he learns the ideas and concepts.because without the facts he cant easily understand concept and he cant even memorize the ideas which he would have been learnt .so the facts are very important before we learn annything.the basic concepts will be learned from the facts and the ideas can be easily learnt.for example if we want to learn about gravitational laws we would first think about the newtonslaw.but the fact is that he founde out the gravitational pull by the apple falling from the tree on to his head..And thus by this we can easily understand the idea and the concept.These facts will be easily leraned by the students and they can reproduce them very effectively.they wont even forget the idea and the concept with taht fact. thus by these facts we can easily learn the topic very easily and effectively.
   Another example for undesrtanding the idea and the concept is that if we want to know how light was evolved there  are many theories and the major fact is that light was discovered by thomas edision after his 99th failure thus by this we can easily capture our mind related to the facts so that which can be easily stayed in our mind.
thus i strongly disaagree the above point  it is more important for the students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .so students must be first learn the facts relating to what they are studying.these facts are easily available and thus they should learn them first and they must keeep them in mind.These facts will surely help the students to increase tgheir memorizing skills and their intrest to the subjects."
4735,0,"I am agree with the statement saying, ""In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than it is today."" The use of cars is in 
the increasing stage during these days. However, I believe that this condition will completely change during next twenty years.

First reason of reduce in use of car will be pollution of the environment. Car is the main cause of pollution of the earth every year. This fact was most likely ignored by the people during past few years. However, people start to recognize the importance of maintaining good environment condition and try to do their best for it. 
Other reason that cars will be less used in the future is the globalization. Globalization means that the world is not separating as an individual but conforming as one big community. Therefore, other transportation, which is airplane or ship, to travel oversea will be more used than the car. Car will be just used for the travel within the land or continent. In fact, people even start to use transportaion such as subway or airplane more than the car. 

The final reason that effects the use of the cars is the development of the technology. I personally believe that the development of the technology will soon invent or create new way of transportaion. This new way of transportaion will be much faster than the car and have less harm on the environment. This will make the cars to be not welcomed by the human society anymore.

The changes in the world occurs much faster than the past. In other words, there can be big change in a very short period of time. Therefore, twenty years are definitely not a short time for cars to be in a less use."
3527,0,"Advertising is often considered by post-modernists as a new vicious means of propaganda. It has penetrated almost every sphere of one`s life; it is to be found everywhere in the public sphere, and has also entered the private sphere through television or free flyers. Its purpose is to present a product but also increase the sales of this product .Thus an advertisement must appeal to the consumer`s senses. It must furthermore convince the consumer that he absolutely needs this good.Therefore, strategies have been developed to increase one product`s sales, and making the product attractive and necessary in one of them. But, as the statement argues, many advertisements enhance the product`s appearence and efficiency so that a gap is created between the real product and it`s image.
In the years following the end of the Second World War, occidental societies have  experienced economic bonanzas coupled with increases in living-standards. People therefore consumed more and more. The means by which advertisers make people consume is sometimes questionable. For instance, advertisements often manipulate unconsciously the consumer, by using subliminal messages. This is one of the way to make a product seem much better. Although diffusing erroneous information about a product is forbidden, some advertisements selectively describe the product and emphasize important features of a product , which are in reality irrelevant. As an example, an advertisement for a car might put forward its comfort while its security is not mentioned. 
Although we can argue that many advertisements make product seem better than the reality is, one might aknowledge that the very purpose of an advertisement is to highlight the good features of the product and silence the mediocre ones. Advertisement have the right to emphasize the pleasant features of a product in order to sell the product to a greater extend. But it shouldn`t in any case lie to the consumer, at the risk of being discredited."
3663,0,"Nowadays , you can find many people who have an amazing amount of knowledge. But some people seem to be an expert on every subject. It appears to be that not many people really know something about a certain subject, but without real experts , our industrial word would not work.

Experts are obviously needed to receive true and exact information about a theme. But if you want to know, for instance, something about a complex problem in the process of a DNA syntheses, you need someone who learned about that all his studying time! To avoid misunderstandings of very popular themes, like Biotechnique, you need to have clear and verifyed information. If everybody knows a little bit, this puzzle will not end up in a clear picture, but in chaos of incomplete or even wrong information.

But, of course, experts are needed in the industry to create an effective team. For example, to build a house, you need a mathematics expert, a resources expert and so on. They all match together to a perfect team, which now is able to create new ideas , which work. Maybe the head of the team could be someone with a broader knowledge, but, however, his function in the team is to be an expert of organisation.

I am aware of the problem, that if someone is an expert of a certain subject, but does not know anything of the rest of the world , it can come to problems, even dangerous ones. If a doctor does not know anything about politics and the democratic system we live in, he/she could make dramatically wrong decisions. He/She would not understand the values and the social environemet we live in.
To prevent that, a state needs very good schools, which every citzin has to go to, while he is a child and a young man/woman. This school should teach him/her all the neccessary basic knowledge.

Concluding, I would say, that our world urgently needs experts , who know about their subject very well, in order to accomplish all tasks our society comes up with. Good grammar schools must garranty that every citzin understands the basic structure of our society."
1890,0,"Some poople in Japan, where I live, disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. However, I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping communities for the following reasons.

First, school often says that young people have to spent their time studing. For example, My son studies at Shudo Highschool, a private achool in Hiroshima where locates western part of Japan. He wants to communicate wiht our neighborhood. But, he always have many assignments and can not attend a community meetig. In japan, exam scores are most important so young people have to study hard to get high score. In consequent, young people have no time to helping their communities.   

Second, there are few communities in our neighborhood so if young people want, they can not spend thier time helping their communitiew. For example, when I was a junior highschool student there were many communities around us and spent much time to helping our communities. Now, in Japan, people often do not know who lives in thier neighborhood. We do not know each other so there are few communities around us. Because there are few communities, young people do not give enogh time to helping their communities. If there were many communities, young people would give enogh time to helping their communities.  

Terefore, I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities."
9910,0,"Nowadays advertisements are massively used in order to improved the sells of products. However we could wonder wether advertisements reflect products as they are really or not. 
We will first see how products are often depicted as better than they really are by advertisements. Then we will consider the reason of this deformation of the reality.

Advertisements always make products better than they really are since they only show the best aspects and all the advantages of the products. Everybody will agree to the fact that it would be irrelevant for an advertisement to point out the drawbacks of the product it intends to present. If we take the example of an advertisement, aiming at selling a car, the car will be perfectly clean while you will never have such a clean vehicle after a few months of use. Moreover the advertisement will just present the positive aspects of the car considered. For a a small car it will depict its easyness of use in a city and boast its little consumption of oil, but it will not tell us about its lake of habitability or the appearance of the materials use inside it. 

Products are indeed always depicted much better than they are, in order to sell them. Nobody would buy a product not appealing through advertisements. Since advertisements often lead the choice of the consummers who do not want to waste their time in reading a lot of reviews before buying a product, firms spend an incredible amount of money on advertisements. Sometimes advertisements go as far as lying about a product in order to sell it therefore people should be of this. Advertisements often use images to sell products and everybody knows that images could be modified to fit the desire of consummers. 

In conclusion, advertisements make always products more appealing than they really are and peole should reali"
9680,0,"Nowadasys the rythm of life is becoming more and more frantic, and this is quite evident and clear to all of us. Anyway I`m not of the opinion that today we are losing values and dedicating our time to unuseful or trivial things. I strongly desagree with the statement proposed and defenitely don`t want to believe that young people don`t spend time helping the community they live in. 

First of all, I want to notice that the chances, offered by society, to join voluntary activities and projects, are much more publicized today than before. Thanks to technological progresses, our wide and fast way of communication make it easier to know the great variety of opportunity for helping someone and somewhere that everyday comes out: from workcamps to sport events, from working with children to bringing help to old people who live alone, and so on.   
The environment a young volunteer can find himself in, is never the same so he/she doesn`t get bored. 

Moreover, the several opportunities are available for all the ages, there are not volunteers too young or to old, just volunteers that want to get on their bike and work a bit for the others.     

I had a personal experience that gave me an important teaching and that I hope my children will desire to do too. Last year I joined a group of 23 international volunteers in Kenya and the aim of the project was to build a road (or may I should say a way) in the middle of a forest to make children able to go to school. It has been an experience unforgettable from many points of view: we were helping that african community and they were very kind with us, we lived in strict contact, so I got the chance to know a different culture in a deep way.

Concluding, I believe that today young people have in mind that every opportunity to help the community and to join a voluntary project, can be an extremely significant tool to mature and also a cultural exchange as much important as unexpected."
6970,0,"Yes i do agree with the statement Most adverstisement make product seem much better than they really are because without having advertisement how can we know about the product. For example take product like oats which is used as food item we can have with hot water and mixing milk and sugar, it can be shown as a TV add by playing a role by reputated person like sports , film actor and like model. play must be for 30 secs only in that we must show all types things like what oats contains and how it is usefull for daily used people by prefoming and add with in 30 sec showing the embalem of the product. The advertisement should be shown globally to people . 

                     Giving advertisement for a product it gives complete picture or use of the product which should be seen by people. Product should have import and export value by their demand.
The product should gain the demand by showing proper advertisements. People should have proper idea on the product they should believe it by seeing proper advertisement. Means advertisement should impress the demanders. Advertisements should be shown globally , there we can find the demand.


Advertisements should have proper theam which impress consumer and they should attract by seeing that,There are many ways to sell the product by giving attractive gifts on using advertisements,  showing that if product is buyed you can have gift coupons of worth of x/ Rs. The whole advertisement should take abcitvate and should gain more demand. 

Advertisements plays an major role to sell a product. because product should show in real and caption shown below with small letter that indicates these play is performed by experts so please u do not follow the same, Means it  incdicates true but not real.

One good examples is that cigar sellings are shown on TV advertisements but on packets it will retuen SMOKING IS INJURIOUS TO HEALTH. The best example for  advertisements make products seem much better than they really are."
8963,0,"I totally disagree with this opinion. To me, the best way to travel is to visit a country alone, or in a reasonably small group of friends. When I travel around, I want to discover the real nature of the countries I visit and I want to decide alone the things I want to see, and these things are not possible in a guided tour.

Guided tours are maybe an optimal solution for old people who are not totally independant, for people who are afraid of the fence that foreign languages can create, or for people who don't want to spend much time abroad. But this option is definetely not an option for me.

Guided tours sell you organised, prepared, ""pre-chewed"" travels. They make you run from one hotel to a point of interest, from one restaurant to a pseudo ""traditional"" show. You can visit France in 2 days, Europe in a week, and have a picture of you in front of all the musts you ""have to see"". I want to have time to feel the atmosphere of a country I visit. I want to explore the hidden regions, to go out of the the beaten tracks.

When you travel in a group, it is impossible to meet local people. You stay with your conspecifics because it is easier, certainly more confortable. Traveling alone force you to exchange with the local population, to speak the local language, to share the local culture. And to me, this is the most interesting part of the travel.

Guides in a guided tou are generally professionnal multilingual guides who are hired by the travel agency. They come from the same country and have only a specific knowledge of the country you visit. Best guides are local people who can present you the really traditional aspects of their regions."
9540,0,"During the education, the studies and even when deciding for a job, people are often put in front of an important question: Is it better to get very deep into one specific subject or to keep a more broad mind. There are several arguments supporting both sides.
On the one hand, the amount of knowledge and information is getting always bigger nowadays because of the internet and the globalisation. So if you want to work on a special topic and produce or design products or even develope new technologies, it is very important to really understand this topic. And because of the enormous amount of information mentioned before, one has to specialize in this single subject.
On the other hand most inventions and developments made today, are just a part of a bigger system. So after inventing and producing very special elements, there have to be people who do not  neccesarily understand every detail of this element, but who know how to put them together to one big and working system. They have to keep all aspects in mind and they also must know where to look if something does not work. Very specialized peole would have no chance here, because they only understand their own component. So broad minded people are needed.
Another point is that people speciaized in one single subject often have very big problems when communicating with other people specialized in a different subject, because they know nothing about it. Here broad minded people are very helpful to connect members of different subjects because they have enough knowledge in both areas.
Finally one also has to see the situation out of a very pragmatic point of view. If you have to leave the company you are working in because it goes bankrupt or whatever, you will have to look for a new job and of course the chances to get employed in a new company is much bigger if you can work in a broad field, than if you only can do one specific work.
Taking everything into consideration, I have to say that nowadays, specialists are very important in our society. But people with a broad knowledge of different acadenic subject are definetly needed and at least as important as specialists."
9235,0,"In my opinion, there are both, advantages and disadvantages about trying new things and taking risks. 
Some people might feel relunctant to change methods of a successful company, others might feel more open about it. I used to be the person who does not take a lot of risk in the past, but recently my attitude has changed. I think that being successful in life, just can be achieved by trying new things and taking risks. For example, a member of a football team. If he just reacts and plays safely meaning making no faults, he cannot get a better soccer player. He just stays at his level, but does not become a professional player one day. A soccer player who wants to achieve someting, has to take risk. This risks can be changing the soccer team where he has stayed for five years to a successul, better team where he does not know the members, the coach or the surrounding of this team. 
Taking risks and trying new things can also have some negative aspects.
If you take risks, there will always be the opportunity to make it wrong, to loose something. But if you do not make faults, you won't learn about things and decisions you made.
An example for a sport where you cannot take any risks is the formula one. The race drivers cannot take risks, because every fault can cause death for them. So, the level of taking risk for car pilots in the formula one, is very low. They have to drive successful, meaning driving fast, but it is very important for them and their team to drive safely.
To sum it all up and to summarize my opinion about the statement ""Successful people try new things and take risks rather than onlz doing what they already know how to do well"", i would say that successful people have to take risks, but there are some situations or some jobs where zou have to do what zou have learned."
3603,0,"I agree with the statement. I personally strongly believe that as an student, to understand ideas and concepts in any subject is very important. There are several reasons of why I support the statement based on my personal experiences. 
	First, to understand ideas and concepts require certain level of reading comprehension skills so that students can fully acquire the essense of the facts or the contexts that they are trying to understand. In other words, students are not just understanding the concepts, but gaining and improving the reading skills to interprete what is written and said in their textbooks. Secondly, by fully understanding the contexts of the facts, students can translate what they have learned and share with others, which enable them to discuss their own ideas and opinions. I think this is a very important excercise as students bacause by doing that, students can learn how to express their level of understanding as well as to have the oppoutunity to hear about others' opinoins on the same subject, which also enebles them to look at things differently if others opinions are different from their own. Thirdly, just learning facts might end up making student to memorize the facts and end up forgetting everything as time goes by especially if the contexts are not interesting to students. Growing up in Japan, where style of education tends to focus largely on memorizing, I know how dangerous it could be. In Japan, even in the subject of mathematics, which is require high level of understanding the concepts and logics behind the equations that are often used in solving problems, students are told and encouraged to remember facts (in this case, many complicated equations). Just memorizing the facts and not fully understanding the ideas behind them, those facts cannot be stayed in the students ""brain"" not even as information, but disappear soon later on. 
	Having lisiting those reasons, I strognly believe that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts about whatever they learn in schools. In addition, to make them realize what they have leared, it is ideal to have the opportunities to share their thoughts. By doing those activities, their knowledge will not disappear as ""memorized"" facts will do."
5834,0,"Advertisement is the most important item and vehicle of the marketing. Therefore the producers desire to have the most attractive one for their products. However this can cause some misunderstandings for the consumers since most of the advertisements show products better than. This essay will state the cheating way of the advertisement and try to find a solution against it.

It is obvious that , most of the people have faced a problem with one of the producs they purchased, since the advertisements only focus on the positive ways of the product. None of the advertisements states the negative approaches of the products that they try to market. Moreover, owing to the competition, the producers try to not announce the all instructions of the product througth the advertisements since a well informed consumer may change her mind and buy an another one. In addition, due to the improvements in computer technology consumers are being attracted by the visional effects by the sector, hence they assume that the product is suitable for them or the product is as good as the advertisement.

In conclusion, most advertisements take an unfair position in favor of the product. Although the advertisement sector should be improved, this does not mean to have a right to breach the rights of the consumers and the other producers that try to compete in the market. Because of this situation the competition and consumer boards of thw countries have to control the advertisements and the consumers must be informed about their legal rigths against the producers."
3620,0,"I agree to the statement "" Most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are"".  In an advertisement such as commercials on TV's and ad's in magazines, it seem like it is a very attrative product and trying to get people's attention by their first look. The company will use backgroung and surroundings, unreal features and famous people to apeal their products.
	When I was a little, I used to see commercials advertisement of barbie dolls all the time. The commericials showed how You could do so many thing with the dolls and how much fun you can have with them. There were music on the background and a perfect set that the girls played in. I was absolutley attracted by the commerical and always asked for a new barbie doll. But when I baught them, it might not move the way it moved in the TV and some of the features showed in the commercial did not come with the product. 
	Another way they are making the product look better, is by using special features. For example, I once saw as TV show that showed how they created commercials for food products. Usually they will not show the real food. There are proffesionals who make food from clays and plastics to show more texture and  better in looks. They will use sprays to show coldness of drinks and steams to show how hot they are. They can also create their commercial using computer graphics so that it can look better.
	The usage of celebrities has an influence on the viewer also. Even if the product is not as good as it looks, when it is held or presented by a famous celebrity, you might think that the product is attractive be convined in buying the product. 
	In an commercial or an advertisement, they will use the background, special features that is unreal, and celebrities to make the product to be apealing. From these reasons I belive that most of the advertisement are making the pruducts look more attractive than it really is."
10658,0,"I think the most advertisements are made to look the products much better than they really are. They make the ad or TV commercials intensionally attract the customer by emphasizing a certain poing of products. 
Typical example is, I think, an advertisements of car. One commercial that I felt like I missed the poing was the one; a man at the groccary casher looks at what he was going to buy and what the other man is going to. He got vegitables and a pack of big in Tofu in his cart and the other man has huge bulk of beef. After that he rushes into a car dealere and buys a big car. An impression that I had from this TV commercial  is,  ""Get a big car, get your dignity."" But the car eats gas like a monster. 
In these days, especiall after the midle-east crisis, the gas efficiency is one of the most important elements when you choose which car you perchase.  More people concern about efficiency much more they used to before. 
I believe that the car company ought to forcus on what the era require them to make and respond what poeple need. 
The ad doesn't show anything like that but encourage people to reverse the flow of the current. 
We, comsumers need to be smart enough to read what they show and what they hide behind the advertisement."
4245,0,"The issue at hand is whether students are supposed to know ideas and concept or to know only facts. Even though some people consider memorizing facts is more important, I agree with the statement, which means that understanding ideas and concepts are more important. First, I would like to discuss it by using specific academic subjects. For physics, some teachers think that students should learn only formula, ie facts, not basic concepts. Last year I had a teacher who belives in this way and I was miserably confused. As the formula of physics seem to be identical, I could not figure out what formulae I was required to use in the exam. As a result, my grade was terrible. However, this year, my teacher has taught me the fundamental concept of physics and how each formula came form. This time, I could handle formula and succeeded in the exam. From this reason, I strongly believe that understanding ideas is extremely prominent and vital.
	Furthermore, it is essential to learn concepts because leaning and memorizing facts are just pain. In my opinion, to learn something is to deepen one's knowledge by having fun. If people are encouraged to memorize facts and not to learn basic ideas, they will likely to dislike studying. On the other hand, if they are supposed to learn concept, they will be able to know the way a thing is and realize how much learning can be fun. For instance, learning histroical facts are boring. Nevertheless, understanding why the event happened is a really attractive method to approach history. In other words, memorizing what happended during the World War II is not fun, but understanding why this happened is extremely interesting. In this manner, understanding ideas and concepts is suited to my opinion."
616,0,"Usually, people are familliare with what they used to do. Some people fears from new things because they are not sure about it, or because they cannot take risk even if this action could open a new doors for them toward good future. I believe that a person should take this risk sometimes and trying new things in his or her life because I think that the ability of the our minds in unlimited. Therfore, I completely agree with the opinion that says people who try new things are able to be more successful.
In our life, getting risk is fundemental part of our world. No one can expect what could happen to him or her. So, I think it is worth it to try new things, use new methood, or meet new people. Many successful people built their successful on a moment that they were breaf.

I consider his decision as breaf and smart decision because after few years he would loos his ability to be good and attractive actore because of his age.

3087,0,"After recaptulating the experience in my life i found both  understanding and learning the concepts are usefull but understanding the ideas and concepts more usefull and scietifical.

I found understanding of conepts more benificial in many fields and ways because by understanding the idea we  know how to apply easily and effctively .

for  example 
in solving a physics problem if you understand the concept you can do it easily and accurately with in lees time compared to others.
another example if we understand  a surgical procedure thoroughly we can perfom it less complications.

Understanding concept also makes us remember the concept for a long time  .  for example i still remember  the dissection of frog which i learned in my school days becuse i understood the  steps of dissection well.

another example is that regadding the differant process that takes place in the human digstive system.

Analyzation of the subject is increased when we understand the concept ,this can be supported with the example of apersonal experience  regarding the case which i saw in the hospital  i found  the symptoms of the disaese icould diagnose a tough case easily.I was able to do so only because i had better understanding of the subject.

Understanding the subject also increases our depth and the the command of the subject for example in organic chemistry we should depth of the concept in order  to judge the correct the reaction .

thus with the correct understanding of concept is essential for all these to occur ."
5333,0,"I do not agree that the best way to tarvel is in a group led by a tour guide. I can agree that it can be good but in my opinion it is not the best way

  I would like to give an example from my own life in order to illustrate why i do not agree. Before I came to New York, I was in Madrid  in order to get masters degree in law. When i was in Madrid, I did not have so many oppotunity to work as a student. For this reason, I used to work as a translator or an assistance for a tour guide. Many times I attended many tours with tour guides to help them. Last year at this time, one big group which consists of more than 35 people came from Turkey and the travel aggent wanted me to help the tour guide and I helped. I was together with this group for almost 8 full days. As far as I could understand from their behaviors and opinions , all of them were much more different than each other. I would like to give an example from one of our activities such as visiting the museum of Prado which is one of the most famous musuems all over the world. While some of them wanted to visit there, a few of them did not. Like this example, there were so many conflicts among people who came for this travel, in addition because the tour guide got angry with them, he was travellling by himself and he did not want to help anyone during the tour. Because of him, I had to help them as i was  a tour guide even though i was there just to help this guy. As long as i was in Madrid, I faced so many events like this while i was working as an assitance of a tour guide. If there are so many people such as more than 10 people in the group,as far as i know and have an experience , to satisfy all people is getting difficult. In my opinion, when all people who attend these kinds of travels know each other, we can consider that one of the best ways to travel in a group but If they do not know each other, I can not say the same thing.
    For all these reasons , it can be summuarized the trip or travel can be best way when you travel in a group , If you know with whom you are going to travel."
4078,0,"I personally diagree with the statement that says that young people do not give enough time to their communities. I disagree with it because it is a very general statment and it is a typical stereotype and categorizing of young people. In addition to that the statment  is a non credible statement  because  it is abviouly based on  personal opinion rather than on  facts , since it is not supported by statistics or any menaingfull numbers.

	The statment carries alot of hidden meaning or even insults to young people because it pictures them as selfish people who doesn't care about their community. Not only that but it also indirectly indicates  that young people are irresponsible people who do not positively contribut in their communities, and are not active/usefull members of their own community.

	In addition to that ,  the statment that has been made against young people is a very general statment , since not all young people do not give enough time to their communities. There are some young people who are addicted to charity work , and who dedicates a lot of their time in helping improve their community and in helping others.Thus we can't generalize.

	I also disagree with such a statement because i personally think that it is a weak statment becaue it is not supported by any kind of eveidence such as a  survey , statistics, or any meaning full numbers. To me this statement is just like throwing accusasions on others.

	 such statments are not acceptable to me not only because i disagree witth this particular statment but because if i accepted such stereotypes it  means that i might as well accept other stereotypes. And by doing that i'll be encouraging  stereotypes that might be more serious  or even dangerous and that might seriouly affcet our society, community, or even the way or even the quality of  our  living."
853,0,"I completely agree with the statement.
We are in the consumis time, that means that people buy things and industrial products not when they really need them, but only for the pleasure to buy something new and have the pleasant sensation to spend the money in those modern supermarket, which you can find everything new in. In this way a person always feels to be original and ""modern"", not ""ancient"" like people that surroand him or her. With this new conception of the money and about the way to spend them, the productors of objects that are every day used (such the mobile phone, the tv, the shoes and so on ) invent always new way to make those products attractive. In this way people feel obliged to buy the last thecnological mobile phone for example, otherwise the seem to be out, but not for the really need to have it. And what is the best way to let their new products be known all over the world? 
The answer for this question is simple and everyone know the answer. Simply the answer is: advertisement. 
We can watch the tv or only look at every journal to verify this sad truth. If the advertisement is the quicker and most seen way to spread news about an industrial product, in order to let people know my last innovations, why don't use this simple way of diffusion according to the imprenditor's volonty?
And in order to sell more pieces of a product, so that this imprenditor can get much more money, what about making an advertisement annunce putting lies in? 
It's not a true lie, but only a manner to pubbicize the product in a wrong way: not like an object that you can buy only if you really need it, but like an object that you can't live without it.
For this reasons advertisements make product better they really are."
705,0,"Succes

	I agree with the statement ""Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well"". I agree with this statement because if a person do only what they know how to do the best, they are not chalenging them selves and become just like others, who dose not try their best, around you. To challenge and to explore and taking risks will lead to a success. 
	To me the meaning of success is to do more then you can do. To do more then what you are, you need to try new things or even new ways of trying and take risk doing it. Eventualy your efort will pay you back in many areas. The success could be diffrent then how rich you are. The money dose not define success.
	I belive that the success is not just about making money but how to be diffrent from other people like how much you know and have exprinced. You may not be successful even after you try new things and taken risks. But the exprience you have and more knowlege you have then others makes you successful. 
	The Success is in you. How much you have improved from befor show how much successful you are. When you succed on some thing that you thought it was hard but you tryed and take risk of failing. That makes you successful and better then other not becuse you more money and power then others. Every body have diffrent situation and diffrent level of success. And if you succed in you the power and money will follow.
	Thouse poeple who try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well will succed no matter how much they have improved or how much richer you are. You are a still better then you used to be and did not stay in your confort zone. That is why I strongly agree with this statement."
9842,0,"Throughout our education life, we have been subjects of different kinds of teaching styles. Some teachers teach through making the students learn the facts, while others  try to make students understand the rationale behind the fact. Also\, no matter what the teaching style of the instructor is, some students focus on understanding the idea while others prefer to learn the facts. In my opinion, a student should first try to understand the ideas and concepts rather than learning the facts, because ideas help students build a vision, they are more implementable and they are easier to keep in mind.

First of all, when a student understands a new concept, it adds to that individuals' vision. Every concept or idea you understand makes you a person with a larger view of life. It will help you see daily events see in a different way. However, if you only learn the facts, they will be minor memories in your brain; they won't help you built your personal experience quota. For example, when i learned about some concepts of behavior in my 'organizational behavior' class, my perspective of looking to my everyday relations have changed enormously.

Second, once an individual understands a concept or an idea, that will be implementable to every situation she/he will face in the future. While that individual is trying to make a decision on something, that concept will automatically come to his/her mind thus helping with the solution. For example, at enginnering college, I learned the concept of 'muda' which is a Japon word for loss. If our professor only taught it by a specific fact saying that you should eliminate any extra loss in a specific machine, then that would be too narrow. However, she taught us the concep so I could implement it to my light at home. Forgetting your light turned on while you are not in the room casus muda wh'ch is a loss that can be eliminated.

Lastly, concepts and ideas that are understood well are easier to keep in mind whereas specific facts memorized are harder to remember after a certain period of time. I remember reading in amn article that you forget 75% of the things you memorize in the first 24 hours and 90% percent in the second day. Therefore, the facts learned won't be with you for a long time; however, the ideas that you managed to understand will stay with you for a lifetime.

As a conclusion, I definitely agree with the statement suggesting that students' understanding of ideas is more crucial than their learning of facts. Students should focus on understanding the concepts because the ideas will be more permanent, they will be more applicable and they will help them create better views of life."
11967,0,"Before trying to answer the question, I will remark that the way the young spend their time can vary greatly depending on the society we are talking about, as well as the social level of the person: for instance, we cannot consider the behaviour of a poor Ethiopian farmer's son the same way we would consider the behaviour of a British graduate student. For my answer, I will focus on the young in western societies of developed countries, because these societies are the one that I know best (being part of them myself) and because these societies are the one that leave the most leisure time to their younger elements.

In my opinion, it is impossible to formulate a definite answer to this question. Even though it is true that some young people do not spend much time helping their communities, there are other that are more involved in helping their communitiesm such as the scouts, for instance.

Now, I do not think that young people who do not spend much time helping their community should be considered one and only category. Some of them do not have the time, especially who are in particularly difficult field of studies. There are also those who study ofr profession that do help the community, such as firemen, doctors, and so on.

10740,0,"Nowadays it is said that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. Is it true or not? To come up with that question we should make a comparison with the past and today. 

At the past before the technological improvements there were lots of things which a humanbeing was not able to do alone. For example think about not having any washingmachine. When we think about the times that the female humanbeing must be doing all the houseworks. At these times families are much more crowded and as a result people have to wash much more clothes. Washing all the clothes by herself is not possible for a women, all the other young people has to help their mother to have clean clothes. But now almost all of us have washingmachines in our house. When somebody in the family have dirty clothes he\she don't have to call anybody. He\she puts clothes in the machine and in an hour they are clean and ready.

Year by year the population of the world is increasing. There not too much places to work and earn money. At the sum people prefer having small families such as parents and one child to have good life conditions according to their money. At the old times people were usually making farm work. When you are a farmer the more people you have in your family to help you, the more product you will have.
Because of that people used to prefer having crowded families. And when a child has brothers and sisters it has to be social and help the others to have something to eat, to earn money or to have clothes to wear.

Finally by the improvement of technology, life is much more easier but technology makes youngsters selfish. Young people choose playing computer games or surfing on the internet inspite of helping their mother in the kitchen and giving enough time to helping their commutinies."
1710,0,"To choose between having knowledge of many academic sujects or to specialize in one specific subject is difficult due to the fact that it opposes two different way to deal with its academic background.
On the one hand, many people think that it is smarter to focus only on one sole field of study since one will soon become a specialist who can have more job opportunities.
On the other hand, it is also true that having a broader knowledge of many academics can provide a broader job spectrum as well.
Personally speaking, the fact remains that it is far better to study several academic subjects in oder to be able to choose in which one really wants to be specialized in.

The first reason I believe that is that people entering college are mostly too young to know precisely what they will wish to do when they will be adults. Having the possibility to have a glance on several academic fieds can help help them to sharpened their conviction and personallity in order they can choose what area they prefer the most.

Onother way to justify my point of view is that for personal matters it is better to have  the larger possible view on the world.  As a matter of fact, if one wants to try to understand its own life and the world around, the best way is to know a piece of everything rather than to know precisely one thing, which would be to much narrow minded. 

In conclusion, my strong conviction is that it is better to keep a broad knowledge as long as it remains possible before specializing in one specific field. In my opinion, the US school system that provides the choice of one major but also the possibily to discover many other fields of knowledge that can be very different is a very interesting and accurate way to deal with this topic. If I may, I would call it a win-win situation."
9939,0,"Bill Gates, the richest man in the world. What can we say about him? He is revolutionary, imaginative and fearless. Then people might ask what made him so rich and also the way to be one of the successful person in the world. The factor that successful people have is common is that they are fearless but love challanges.
	We tend to do what we already know how to do well. It does not give us any pressure and worries since we are expert in certain area. Working on what we already know how to do might make us feel comfortable to deal with as it will likely take any risk but it might be really tedious as time goes by. 
	By trying to do new things, people get excited with the feeling that we are starting something new that might motivates us. That can be  the reason why some people like to try for something riskly and still happy even it they failed. 
	Trying new things may extend our ability and capacity. We can see how we improve by practicing and by pains in the beginning stage.  By having mistakes and fails, we improve more and finally become experts on the area. This might extend our knowlede as well. Repeating these precious experience, we learn lives and get wisdom.
	Lastly, there are always some possibilities that the new thing that we are trying to start will bring double amount of profit. Bill Gates shows the successful case of it. It is obvious that he had had so much pressure and fears when he started his own business at the first time. As time goes by he got used to his work and acutally became the master of the computer. The accomplishment that he has done might have made the miserable memories of his life when he had just started the business memorable and precious.

7581,0,"The statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities is may right, but in my opinion it could be said not only for young people and not only nowadays. 
I think the time after childhood and befor adulthood have been a difficult time eversince. Teenager have enough to do helping themselfe, so they are may even the only agegroup who should not be blamed for being a bit selfish. But even after you reached your twenties succesful, there is a high number of realy ignorrant and selfish people. It goes on during every ageclass. It is easy to blame the young ones, but even most middel-age and older people are looking away if something uncomfortable happens. 
Anyway, this do not mean, that the statement, that young people nowadays do not care enough, is wrong. If there are too many people in every ageclass who do not spend enough time to help their communities, the younger ones are includet. But in my opinion, most times, they are at least the most helpful orientated group, at least after they maneged their teenage. Just because there are more often more open minded young people than older ones. 
Wich brings us to the word ""nowadays"". It is may likely that in passed times the family bond was stronger, so there was more help during most families for each other. But the community does not mean only the people we love, but also people who are may totaly different, with opinions we don't share, with behaviors we don't understand. But to help the community means even to help them, if help is needed. To help some stranger on the street was way more uncommon in past times but today. And even if most of the charity organisations have mostly older members and helpers, it doesn't mean that the younger generation don't care. Most times the young people are thoses who want to change something.
I totaly agree that there are not enough people who spend enough time to help their communities, but at the end you can't blame it only to the younger ones nowadays. It is and was a general problem."
10739,0,"""Knowing little about many things or knowing more about less things"" is a question that we face many times in our life. The explosion of knowledge in incresing number of knolege fields make this question more provocative. I think that answering this question is affected by expected gains of each answer as well as the personality of the individual to answer. The life experience and career of a person can support one answer and undermine the other answer.

Speciality is a relative concept in this case. Any career needs a certain degree of speciality in these days. You can not go to any field without having the necessary knowledge and skills, as well as attitudes, that compromise such field. I think that the question is related to the level of speciality that one needs. In other words how deep we need to go in the field of speciality. Another level of the issue is about wether this will isolte us from other fields, i.e ignoring horizental knowledge.

As a social worker, I think it is more empowering for me in my work and life to be of broad knowledge. Having broad knowledge will facilite my communication with different types of clients. When the client feels yuo  share with him or her a language he or she will build trust and feel nearer to you. Another reason for that stems from the ability of understding the environment of the case that may include different types of knowledge. This will save you from going every time to somebody to help you.

Another point that makes me oppose ignoring broad knowledge for the sake of more specializing is related to the personality of an individual. I think people who like to grow vertically in knowlege ignoring horizental growth will end up socially isolated wether they like or not.

8891,0,"Many of the companies believe that, the advertisement for the a product is crucial, vital for its presentation to the customers. And most of the customers believe the scenes created by the advertisements wil come true when they buy this particular product. 
Considering the reasons behind these advertising activities makes me to believe that too much of advertisement about one particular item indicates that it should have at least defects to cover. Addition to this, I will support my opinion based on the facts that; the life styles that are promoted by the companies, the reliability of the information presented and the threats to the uniqueness of our lives. 
    First of all, I am against the notion of the belief that, buying a product will change my life forever (until the new product comes into scene). Many of the women customers believe that, by using a particular brand of shampoo, they will have a hair like Rapunzel, or the fourty-year-old women will become ""chicks"" by using anti-aging facial creams. So do we have fourty-year-old women around? with wrinkles?Subsequently, the advertisements try to sell the consumers the life style that is shown on the TV, not just the product itself. 
   Secondly, I am sure about that, the scenes we watch are not totally true. The photography of the colorful, delightful food are mostly shot at the time when the food is half cooked. Also, the hair in the shampoo advertisement was first cleaned, polished and finally probably made with a sophisticated hair designer. Every type of hair will look as the same as it appeared in the AD, if processed that much.  
   Consequently, advertisements are harmful for our unique lives. Out traditional clothes, our grandmother medications, all.. The colors people like to wear should not be changed over seasons with fashion. Do you belive that we wear the 60s clothes nowadays because of the advertisement we saw on each day, regarding the new fashion of the year? Everyone in this world will soon wear a jean in the future. It is not so diffucult to estimate what we will be wearing in the next future, just the same type of cloth.
   To conclude, the advertisements are harmful for our lives, in the way that the life styles that they offer, the scenes that they create and threatens the uniqueness of our lives."
5149,0,"I completely agree with the statement you have made. The companies make big investments either on research and development or their workers and they think that it is their right to gain economical benefit out of this by means of advertisements.  

First of all, there are many brands in the market that sell products in the same area of interest. As a consequence of this, the firms need to diversify their products among others and they make use of the advertisements. Although a product of one firm isn't good enough and well qualified, one may be astonished to watch this advertisement trailer on a television and make a decision to buy that product even if he/she does not need it.  

Secondly, in order to persuade the customers that they have the best product presented in the market, these firms invest much money on the production of an ad. They  work with professionals when developing the movie, hire famous people and celebrities that are appreciated and loved so that these celebrities make the people believe that the product they are presenting has cutting edge quality and reasonable price. These people also aim the children and the youth who are easily get affected and have great influence on their parents when they are making a purchase decision. These companies have a great knowledge in human psychology so they are trying to do their best to persuade the customers and make their products sold. They also arrange some campaings that would attract the people. 

Next, after your purchase you may see that the product you have bought is not as good as it was seen on television. Some firms are trustable and some are not and as a result of this you might feel disappointed. 

As a result, companies try to sell their products and make money and the thing that a customer should do is to buy from a trustable company and prefer its products,"
1973,0,"Is it the best way to travel  in a group led by a tour guide? Some people might say yes to the subject. However, it is my view that it is not the best to travel in a group led by a tour guide. In other words,
people cannot fullfil their desires and needs during the journey if they
were in a group led by a tour guide. The examples of Leonardo Da
Vinci, thugs(or horse-riding buglars) in rural areas of China, and
Herman Merville validate my statement.

When people talk or read an article about the graceful and glorious 
days of  Renassiance, people soon encounter a familiar name 
called Leonorado Da Vinci. Leonardo Da Vinci has renowned from
those days of Renassiance for his ginuine intellectual 
accomplishments over the various subjects: Art, Sciensce, 
herbalogy, anatomy and so forth. However, not many people are
aware of Leonardo Da Vinci as a travler. Da Vinci made all his trips
alone(or with a servant at his service)  through out the European Continent as one of his favorite activity when there was a demand
for his cunning hands at various subjects. Da vinci also took a lot of
shor-trip to fullfil his desire for more knowledge and observation which meets his interests. Da Vinci was the man who knows the
taste of traveling alone.

It is not very common(or well-known) fact that there is still 
horse-riding buglars in rural areas of China. And people feel more arkward when it comes to their ears that this is something going
on as a current event. What does this do with the wellness of the
people who frequently goes to China traveling alone? Nothing
pretty much unless you are a ever-wonderer who always seeks
the scarcely inhabited lands. Moreover, these buglars are mostly
caught for the safetly of lonely travelers who even wants to travel
undeveloped lands of China.

There is a great guest from Literature, Herman Merville when you
talk about the one who seeked out the wilderness of nature. Herman
Merville made such great deeds on his work of The Whale(Or The
Moby Dick) after whaling although he travled not alone and rather
accompanied and guided with experienced ones toward whaling.
However, whaling or sailing has been always the subject of great
travlers whether they like to travle alone or not they accompanied
and guided with more experienced ones since there has been 
always no choice since traveling on the seas has to have a group
work(in most terms) unless you are a lonely sailor with a small boat
which goes not far away from ashore. Herman Merville would have
not been recalled as a great writer if he had not been a great
sailor as he has been renowned.

All the instances from Art,History and Current-events validate my
statement. It is always the best to travel lonely."
4462,0,"Are young people happier than older ones? I think that this statement is the sad reality. We'll quickly see the arguments on the paper

Firstly, young people have much more occasions to make new friends than old people. If you go out every week, if you're invited at your friends' places twice a week, your chances to meet new people are amazingly high. The truth is that you only can and want to have this kind of life when you're relatively young

Besides as a young personn you are not as involved in your family life as your parents might be. You can spend the time you want with the people you really care about without thinking about the duties you need to do back home.

Studying abroad is an opportunity you can't miss. With the increase of links between the earth nations it has became easier to study abroad than before. As a result, today students have much more chances to go in a foreign country than their parents had. Proof of this point the increasing students demand for the erasmus program and the strong relationships that universities maintain together.

Last but not least, old people have to work and secure an income to make sure that their family could live safely. It's not the case when dealing with young people that can do whatever they want as long as they are good at school at the end. A young guy can relax as much  as he want. He even can leave school if he doesn't like it. An adult can not afford it. He can not chill out because someone is counting on him: The young personn.

To conclude, I would like to say that we musn't be blind, There are too many arguments in favour of the point supported in the paper and so few for the opposite point that the answer should be obvious. Life is better when you are young."
7477,0,"I can't make a clear decision wether i agree the statement or not, because it depends on the product and especially on the brand. 
I think that products and brands being popular and well known won't cheat with their advertisment. One reason is that the quality of most of this products is so high that there is no need for the enterprises to lie. A second reason is that the enterprises harm their image if they promise something their product can't fulfill.
But on the other side new or unknown brands which will conquer a market can't survive if they won't get humans attention. That's why many enterprises have to make big promises to attract the consumers view. Examples can be seen daily in TV or in the written media. 
In our days I think I tend a bit more to the fact that I won't agree with the statement. In the time of internet there is a high transparancy concerning the quality of goods. Statements of people who used the product could be looked up and so if one product has bad critics the enterprise could be kicked out of business.
Furthermore there are several institutions like the German "" Stiftung Warentest"" which test products to give a neutral statement, and people give much upon their opinion.
Last but not least the legal situation for businesses is more difficult. So there is only a small path between what is legal exageration and what is illegal cheating. 
So the risk to harm the business, for an enterprise, is big enough that most of them won't make their products better than they realy are because there is a lot of danger in being punished by the state or even the consumers."

Currently studying at a university in Paris specialized in Information Technologies and Electronics, I agree that it can be very enriching to take the opportunnity in starting something you never did.
I got this policy for a long time since I entered in this university. 

I always try to be aware of the news technologies related in computer science and, then to start using it. For instance, I am working on big project for one month now. This project can be summarize by creating a software used by agricultor in order to help them to organise their productivity. Thought I use the java langage of programmation, I take the initiative to learn by myself a new language called AJAX. I never learned it before but I think that it could increase the numbers of the fonctions for the software.
Thus, I rather take a risk in learning this language because I don't have a lot of time to learn and use it correctly.

Moreover, as a student in fourth years, I don't have a lot of time for other extra scholar activities. Even If I know that working for a company at the same time of studying will be difficult i do it. For instance, the next month, I will develop the new website for a company and develop another one for an organisation.
I accepted to work on these project in order to make of course some money to pay my scholarship but also to learn new things.
Everytime I take the opportunity to enter in a new project and participating very well I always learn more. No only on the technical field as programming but also on the human interactivity as communicaton for example.

In conclusion, I approve tis statement and use to encourage my friends in doing itm even I know that I might probably help them."
11251,0,"In my opinion it is very important to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects and, in the mean time be specialized in one specific subect. I believe that there are a lot of things that must be known by everybody. 
  I think that what we learn at school must be the most diversified as possible. We need to study a lot of subjects and read many different critics to be able to better understand the people and the society we live in. Only by having a very wide knowledge we can understand what we really like and consequentally began to study a specific subject which can help us to work in the right way everyday. I belive that a lot of subjects are linked together and required the study of other subjects to develop a complet and good idea on a topic. For example while studying a foreign language I think it is important to study the culture, the geography, the literature and the economy of all the countriesa where that language is spoken. In this case it would be important to study sociolagy, geography and economics in addition to that foreign language grammar. Only by having such a developed knowledge we would really be able to say that we know a foreign language otherwise everytime we go to that specific country we would not know anything about it and we would feel unusefull and ignorante.
  I also belive that a broad knowledge is important in everyday life. For example how could we be able to read an economic article on a newspaper without knowing the basics of economics?
  According to all that I said I believe that a broad knowledge is a need that each person feels inside and it is something that needs to be develloped and extended everyday by readings books or articles as well as by watching documentaries on television."
7161,0,"Most people think that enjoyment comes from experience, but in my opinion, when we first experience something we enjoy it more. There is a saying that a thing is attractive untill you get it, in other words, when you wish for something and do not get it easily, you are more keen to get it. After getting that thing, you loose your interest in it. This is the human nature. So the meaning is that younger people enjoy their life more than older, because they experience things for very first time. I also agree with this opinion that young persons enjoy life more than older people. 

To support my opinion, firstly, I would like to disscuss the tendency or the nature of youngers. First of all, they are very curious about new things. They want to explore everything regardless of danger associated with it.
For example, when I was a kid, I was always curious about parachute, and one day what happened, I just jumped from my roof top with an umbrella. At that time I did not know, what is fear. So meaning is that, you can not expect this kind of absurd behavior from an older person. Even, if an old  person does not know the harm associated with the task, he/she might not take risk.

Secondly, youth do not care for moral values, whereas old people do follow them strictly. From their experience of life, senior people know the value of ethics and would like to follow always.On the other hand, teenagers are unlikely to follow the moral values, or they follow reluctantly.

Thirdly, In my opinion, you can enjoy the life if you don't have restriction on you activities. Old people have resposibilities towards society, as well as towards their own family. While youngers are free to do whatever they want. For an instance, I like to dance publically,  and I do whenever I get chance to do it . But I know some older people can not do it because first they think about others opinion such as ,what would the society think, or what would be the impact on children.

Last but not the least, young people are always open to new ideas or cultures, while older people have narrow mind. It is easy for a younger to adapt a new culture in order to learn it . On the other hand, senior persons are rigid to their own culture in order to preserve it.

Conclusion is that, although it is true that older people enjoy life based on their own life time experiences, I strongly hold the view that youngers enjoy the life more than them. The main reasons are, will to explore new things, no responsibility, less regard for values or ethics, and more energy to enjoy life."

8634,0,"Learning facts can be useful for a student, but this cannot be sufficient for them. Understanding ideas or concepts contribute to develop opinions and a critical point of view about reality. In short, understanding ideas and concepts you can obtain a ""key of reading"" of the world. You can begin to think with your own mind.
First, students need to grow not only phisically but also spiritually and intellectually. Learning facts by hearth it is not useful for them. Sometimes hystory teachers force students to learn dates and hystorical events by hearth. Then, after one or two months, students have already forgotten all dates and all related hystorical events. It is important, in my humble opinion, to understant the background of every event, and, at the same time, have the ability to collocate it in the line of the time. Once you have recorded a date, you can rebuilt in your memory the hystorical background. This is the function of a 'by hearth learning'.
Secondly, developing a critical point of view and a vaste range of opinions is fundamental for a student, because it is the moment when he is building his personality. Thinking with your own mind is fundamental to living in our society, where everyone acts only in function of their own interests. In a nutshell, to live choosing your partner, or which cloath you like, or where to go when you want, it is the secret of freedom. However, a freedom that respects and that take into account the freedom of everyone, as said the French philosopher Jean Jacques Rousseau.
Thirdly and finally, this is why I think it is important for young people having their own ideas."

The fact that there is almost not restrictions about some advertisement let big companies a lot of false and even impossible arguments to sell their product . Also ,  they know how to touch people's thought with their different analysts . The most dramatic of all is the use of peoples symbol which misleads people ' statements . 
The restrictions on televisions commercial are very small or don't even exist . A company owner has simply to give the the money for the advertisement of the company .

The other probable element wil be the use of analysts . Those analysts are very smart because they know what people want to hear .So , with only one speech written by them , they can make a product seem as fantastic when this product is not .As example , we take a man who wants a car . Now , this man watchs an advertisement on which they say that the car  make girl crazy ,and even shows you a woman who is persecuting a man because of the car . The man will like to have this car in the minute following these advertisements . However , is that statemement in the advertisement true ? These statement is not . So , a lot of peoples will be fooled . 
The most dramatic thing about advertisement is the use of people's symbol or fan to sell product .

4620,0,"About fifty years ago, one the greatest President of the United States pointed out the main problem of modern societies. John F. Kennedy said, do not ask what the country can do for you, ask what you can do for the country. We live in a society that promotes individualism. Individualism can be definied as way of projecting problems only through you own scope and to pay less attention at your environment.
I think individualism is more and more developped and people tend to give less time to their community. This subject is the great battle between the Ancient and the Modern. According to the Modern, people are more and more focused on their personal environment, that is to say their family, friends, work environment and themselves. 
In our modern society, this phenomenon reaches young people even more that parents and grandparents. They used to be raised with a very high sense of values, focused on work and religion. Even if each family, according to its history, need, wealth, had its own priorities, these were the main values. And there was a sense of commun work and commun need.
Young people who live in modern societies tend to be more focused on themselves and to be more selfish. In developped countries, they do not fear hunger, thirst, problems of wealth. I think that most of them are self centered.  We must believe that this kind of attitude will change and that young people with give more time to help their communities. On the one hand, there is always the role of religions. They can be used to make people understand the importance of giving, sharing and receiving. On the other hand, we can hope that intellectuals and politicians will raise these question in the future. Not only is the idea of helping the community relevant,  but it is also more and more important in a time of great incertainty."
3565,0,"It is true that most advertisements make products look better than how they really are and it must be like that because, if you have to sell a product,  you must overrate it a little bit, you must put in evidence the good qualities of it and you must hide its bad peculiarities.
it doesn't mean lying but it means just not to tell some parts of the truth in order to convince people that your product is good to be bought.
What the Latins called ""dolus bonus"" is the usual overrating that the seller makes of his products and it is absolutely permitted. 
On the other hand what is not permitted is the real lie: for example you can't say that you had got a prize for your product without having gotten it really; you can't denigrate your competitor's product in order to exhalt your product, in other words you can't do nagative publicity.
what is permitted is a comparative publicity: it consists in an objective comparison of objective datas.
I think that the Italian law, the one i have been speaking about is good and I think it shouldn't be changed also because it works and is respected.
What I do not like of publicity is that it creates needs. It is very negative because, striking the emotional part of people who look at it creates in them a lot of needs that they didn't have before.
Nowadays people waste a lot of money in things that they don't need and quite often lose sight of the most important things in life because they must have the last model of that watch, because they must have the sweater of that particular trademark, beacause they need to be trendy.
I think that this last effect of publicity is very negative and should be fought by expressing this point publicly and often."
1979,0,"Some people believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects  whereas others support to specialize in one subject.In my opinion, notwithstanding  a person should have knowledge of all related academic subjects, to specialize in one specific subject is most appropriate in compliance with this century.

We are living in a century in which it is easy for everyone to reach information about nearly anything at anytime they wish. However this knowledge is generally too surface based. Therefore the level of knowledge determines the difference between an academic person and non-academic person. To specialize in one academic subject prevents a person from spreading his energy, effort and time to too many things at the same time and helps to contrate on  that one subject whereas broad knowledge of many academic subjects shall only result with a lot of unnecessary, unclear and ambiguos knowledge which ends up with no contribution to academics at all.

The areas that agrees to specializaton has been increased by the  development of technology. Science has been seperated to much more branches than it was fifty years ago. For example principles such as law and medicine encourages people to specialize in one specific subject since it is impossible to learn to a subject deeply with a surface based knowledge.

Thus, i believe that considering the easiness and quickness at reaching information, it is better to specialize in one specific subject in order to draw a difference between academic and non academic."
4786,0,"every long holiday, we can see a lot of young people playing at  parties,going shopping,traveling and taking partites with their friends.abd most of their psrents stay at home.that is a common phenomenen in many societies.  from this  scene,we can see young people enjoy their life than the old people do.in my point of view,this situation may based on several reasons.

the young love to try new thing,and they are easier to master a new technology.they tend to live in a stimulating life.for example,during my travel, i have met a 19-year-old boy,he told me that he made this travel for jumping.i am surprised and didn't know why he wanted to""jumping"".then he told me that is a kind of new sport item.he would jump from a high mountain or a gliff! the reason he was fasinated with this is just because he was trying new things.he has enough courage to enjoy himself by this wat,but  the old can't. we are young, we can meet challenge physically and mentally.

the second reason is that the young spend money more generous.the old should thnk about their future without salary and the money prepared for a heavy disease.but the young can spend all money they have earned .an australian told me that the average saving of  australian young people is 4 dollars. they uses all money enjoying themselves.of couse,you can spend money on clothes,ps2,computer,etc.it makes the young's life more colorful.

and the society also help the young to enjoy their life.when my family went to a ktv. i can choose all songs i want to sing,they are all pop songs.but when my mum wated to select an old song ,she felt disappointed,because there is no traditional songs in the song store!so the whole society create an environment for young to entertain themselves,that helps us to be more convient to enjoy life.

in conclusion,young people have more money ,more time and more situation to make their life more wonderful.but the old are hardly to get an opptunity to enjoy their life.i thing maybe different methods lead to different life styles,some old enjoy themselves  too.it may depends on people's charactistic.but mre young people enjoy themselves than their parents and grandparents."

The first of all , people take many acagemic subjects that can find their porpose on life to dcision. Forexample , if to future wanting to do it the person who larned a lot feel of broad  lookout on life.
  





Second reason is that people can make many friends .
For example, when  was a hight school student. I took some subject. I larned many kind of subject,also I could make  difrent types friends. They have many  varietion idea each friend."
1125,0,"I agree with the statment that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.
If I think about my past when I was younger. I can remember the idea that my friends and I had about helping our communities. We used to spent at least few hours a week to provide services and help people that were in some kind of trouble.
Naturally our help was related with our age, but it was a good way to teach us the sense of community.
Nowadays I can see in many different occasion that young people are more selfish, they think just about themself and what is the best thing to do just for themself.
During last years I have never met a young person that was giving some of his time to do something helpfull for the community. In our modern society there are many thing that everybody should do for the benefit of our community, and some of them should be done expecially by young people.
For example they should spent part of their time staying with old peolple and help them. I think this is a good way to learn the history and get a sense of responsability. I remember that I used to do that expecially with all my grandparents, and I learnd many things from them.
Nowadays young peolpe prefer to stay with their friends maybe waisting time or doing something really useless. 
Probably there are different reasons why young peolpe have this kind of attitude, but I think that the most important reason is related with their parents. I think they forgot wich are the most important values in a sociaty. They also did not teach what a kid should do for his growing and how relate with the community.
I am sure that if I will have a children I will teach him how to give his help to his community and how to relate with it."
6619,0,"I would like to discuss the statement that young people do not spend enough time to help and suopport the community they are living in.

To my mind young people nowadays spend less time helping their communities than they did some decades ago but you should consider that there are quite a lot of things that have dramatically changed over the past few years. Now, there are many new services offered by the government that give us the opportunity to spend our time doing something else than working for our community. An example for this would be the improved helthcare system: Some time ago, it was nearly impossible to work in full-time job if one of your relatives was very ill and needed permanent care and help. Today, you just have to apply for special services that are paid by the insurance and you will be given help.

However, there are still some some services which cannot be provided and / or paid by the community. In those cases (i.e staff at the fire brigades, ambulance drivers, trainers at sports clubs etc.) there is indeed kind of a shortage. In my free time, I am working as an ambulance driver without being paid for this. Often have I experieced situations in which we ran out of personnel because nobody wanted to work on the weekend or wanted to stay up all night. I wish that in those cases, more people would recognize how important their contribution would be.

All in all, I think that we do indeed need a young generation that spends more time helping their communities than many people do now, but we only need their support in some fields. So my suggestion would be to try to make some advertisement and promotion in order to show them how much fun it can be to play an active role in society and to help them to find the right kind of occupation for them."
3196,0,"some people think that Young people nowadays do not give time to help their communities. Others, on conturary, think the opposite.

from the daily life point of view, Young people are intersted in having fun with all the means of intertainment that are brought to us almost every day and changed our everyday life. Music, computers, internet are one of these means. When we think about the limited activities that Young people can do in the past, they had to keep themselves busy with things even if it requires some effort. 

Not all Young people are not interested in helping their communities. In fact, I know many organizations that are created by students, and only involves students. 

But older people need to guid young people to do community sevices. since their only interest is on getting good grades at school and making a lot of friends. They need to understand the young people's thinking, and creat cummunity sevices for them through schools clubs.  because they know they have other things to do for themselves  instead of doing for the community for example, school work. In additions, new organisations are created every day and the government gave more interest to the community in general.

8148,0,"From my point of view, I agree with the statement that it would be better for a student to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than to specialize in one specific subject only. I will explain it from three aspects, personal interest, personal development and vanishing subject.
Firstly, not much students can realize their interest that which subject they like most. Many of them, including me would get frustrated when we should make a choice among thousands of subjects to study in university. However, if we no need to choose a specific one to concentrate on, we can expose to different kinds of subjects and hence develop our interest. It is really regrettable if we make a wrong decision is choosing it.
Secondly, broad education can nurture students to be an all-rounder. All companies demand all-rounders instead of students with specific knowledge. Of course, everyone should have his/her strengths and weaknesses. However, broad education allows students to develop more comprehensively. For example, the art students may be weak in communication skills or the science students may be too rational. But if all students are put together and study more subjects, a  student's personality may have influence on the others besides gaining other subjects' knowledge.
Last but not least, it prevents some subjects to be vanished or even disappeared. Sometimes, students choose subjects that have good future career such as business. Few people would choose subjects just based on interest. Therefore, this leaves some subjects like Chinese history to become vanished. But Chinese history actually is worth studying and important for young people to familar. At this point, if we set broad knowledge is a must, the problem won't happen.
In conclusion, studying in many subjects is better than specialize in one as it allows students to develop more interest, to become all-rounded that can benefit their future career and also prevent some subjects from vanishing."
1161,0,"Peoples like to travel around the world, they wants to know the have a very good memory and able to know different culture in different country,  In my country, people usually go to travel as a group which led by a tour guide, because it is much more cheaper and they wants to go with their friend or family. In my point of view, I think we still can travel to other country by ourself. On that condition, you can do whatever you want and to able enjoy the trip.

Firstly, the country that you pick to travel which probably is the country that you wants to go the most uring that time. Usually, if you go with your friend or family, you need to take care about them, you need to discuss where to go before getting out of the hotel. During the discussion, you might have different opinion with others. So, the advantage of the going alone is you can do want you want and go to the place that you wants. It is very good that you don't have to disscuss with other and you can arrange your own time.

Secondly, most of the people wants to have a relaxing and confortable trip during their travel. They probably don't want to miss out some special place or food in that country. Also, they usually want to have good memory if they are really enjoy to visit the country and might go there once again. Since going with a group of people, you might feel very innoying, usually, if it is led by a tour guide, the time is very limited, you go to the place and then you need to go to another place as soon as possible. After the whole trip is finish, you might feel that actually you didnt visit and know the country much. Therfore, if you go alone, you might enjoy your trip and may be you can know some new friend.

In conclusion, some people might think that travel alone is kind of stupid, they just want to go with their friends and family. During the trip, there is someone who are willing to talk with you. But actually, travel alone to other country is not that bad at all, we can arrange our own time and go to the place that we want. We will know some new friend and fully enjoy during the trip."
12077,0,"I would love to believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. But it is sad to see in human history that most times we have made the good choices too late. However two major  contemporary problems seem to support this opinion: the huge ammount of air pollution caused by vehicules all around the world and the fact that we are running out of fuel reserves. 
Which means that basicly we should stop using our cars as much for the sake of the environment and we are going to have to anyway in the future. At least in what concerns cars as we know them today.
So the question is: why aren't we changing now the way our vehicules work since we are going to have to do it anyway? Why not find today an energy that would keep our cars running but wouldn't pollute? 
The truth is that modern technology is able to do that- cars that run with electricity or solar panels exist- but the finantial intrest of these massive gas and oil companies seems to come first. I once heard a sentence that resumes this attitude. Two oil investors, one says to the other: "" One day with all the money we make from industry we will be able to clean up the environment"". But this is simply not true. At one point it does become too late. 
We have to act now so that in twenty years there will be indeed  fewer cars that cause pollution. This transition can be done today with significant changes. For example, why should every member of a family have a car when one is enough? We should all start taking the bus."
6585,0,"I agree with this statement. If a student once has understood an idea or a concept, he is able to increase his knowledge easily without learning a lot of facts. He will without doubt learn facts, but not because someone tells him the facts, but because his increasing interest of the subject. And the interest increase because he understand the idea/the concept of a system.
The global warming for example:
If a student once understand the connection between the increasing temperature and the effect of the climate,  he is able to look deeper, to see how everything is connected.
This can be a very fascinating experience. It is also importent, to have an inspiring teacher who knows, how to fascinate his students. If this is the case, the teacher doesn't have to bother the students with boring facts, he just has to explain the idea/concept of a system properly. 
It is also important to give the students time and support to find out things by themselves. The result is an increasing self confidence. I guess it is like a vicious circle in a positive kind of way. Once a student has gain more self confident, his interest in the matter is growing, the researches are getting more intense, the results are also getting more accurate and he will learn the facts as a result of his interest, because he wants to know the background.
He doesn't need to have a boring lesson to learn the facts.

9247,0,"People hold different opinions of whether or not young people enjoy life more that older people do. One may claim that young people can enjoy life more since they have more energy. However, i will argue that people can enjoy life equally, both the youngs and the elders.

The first reason in support of my view is that people have equal right in terms of enjoying life. Nowadays, numerous games and activities tends to become suitable to people at any ages. Traveling would be a perfect example to prove my argument. More and more travel agencies provide different trips and vacations regarding to the differences of ages. Elder people can join and group for seniors, likewise, youngsters can participate one designed for their age.

Second of all, people enjoy life in the same level although they may do activities in different ways. The acitivities that young people like to do, such as video games or extreme sports, the seniors may not enjoy doing. Instead, they may like prefer doing other things, like gardening or cooking. However, there is no definition that tell people which games are more fascinating or which activities are tedious. When it come to how to enjoy life, it more likely to depend on different people.

last but not least, some people may argue that the people are more energitic to do more activities. In my point of view, due to the amazing developments of modern medicines and health care, the elders are in better healthy conditions which provide them to enjoy some highly active sports as well. The man, who is in his seventies,  go to swim everyday in the morning. I believe some young people even cannot keep this everyday routin. The youngs may not have interest on it, or they even don't have sufficient time to do it as some older people.

In conclusion, i am highly convinced that both the youngs and the olders enjoy life equally since they have the same rights, although they may enjoy life by participating different activities. Besides, the contribution of the medical science on seniors health also increases the opportunies to do more activities for them"
11767,0,"When you study, there are mainly two ways of studying; understanding ideas and concepts, and learnimg facts. In this essay, I would like to respond to the statement; it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. But before I start judjing the statement, I would like to raise advantages and disadvantages of two ways of learning.
	Firstly, I would like to raise advantages of studying ideas and concepts. The first advantage is that if you understant an idea or a concept, you can solve more difficult and complex problems using your understanding. It means you can use your knowledge in variety of situations and it is definitely a good thing. The second advantage is that it is interesting to learn an idea or a concept. Most people feel satisfaction or feel happy when they understand new things. An idea or a concept is sometimes difficult to understantd but it is more enjoyable to study than just memorising facts. I fpeople feel happy to study, thei r motivation toward the study goes up.
	One advantage of understanding concepts and ideas is that  iunderstanding concepts is much more difficult than learning facts. So people could stop trying to understand concepts before they succeed to.
	Now i want to raise advantages of learning facts. The first advantage is that it is easy to remenber facts. You do not have to understandwhat you are memorising about; everyone can do it. People could be confident if they succeed to memorise facts; it stimulates their interests in what they are studying. The second advantage is that since facts do not depend on one' s feeling, facts are universal. There is no communication gap between facts. Therefore if you learn facts, you can show off your knowledge to people who do not speak your language.
	However there are also disadvantages for learning facts. One disadvantage can be raised and it is that you are not understanding concepts behind the facts. If you do not understand concepts, you can not use your knowledge in a different situation. 
	I strongly agree with the statement which says it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts; yet as described in this essay, it is also important to learn facts. The best way of studying is to combine both ways of studying. However if a student is only allowed to choose one of the two ways, I strongly recommend to focus on understanding concepts and ideas rather than learning facts."
139,0,"I totally agree this satement because I have been taught in this style. Teachers always say the most important thing for being a student is that you need to comprehend the main ideas and concepts, which may either appear on the exams or use frequently in your lifespan. 
     I believe that the most of concepts and main ideas which had been examinated before published, so the concepts and ideas I have been studied are all based on facts, meaning they are all connected with each other. If the new facts appears , it also will be modified or adapted into the concepts or ideas I've been studing. Therefore, I agree that learning ideas and concepts means learning that facts.
    If the newly discovered facts conflicts with the established coincepts or ideas, how should those publishers do? Well, I asked this question to my professor before, and he told me that if the new fact conflicts the established concepts. the specific evaluator will figure out the menthods to fix the original concepts. For example, if the gravity were not 9.8, the scientists will demostrate the experiments for both old results and the new fact. Moreover, once they discover that the fact is valid , they will replace concepts with the new concepts based on the results from experiments, meaning the ideal concepts and the optimal ideas will modified according to the new concepts. Therefore, the concepts and ideas I have been studying will be made sure whether or not it's correct .
    In contrast, apparently, the discovered facts are not always valid.

8,0,"Whether or not young people enjoy life more than older people do is an interesting question, and I for one disagree with that statement. First and foremost one has to understand that enjoying oneself does not necessarily have to mean enjoying similar things. With that in mind, it becomes clear that older people do not necessarily enjoy life less than young people do.

First, let's look at two different rather popular activities for both, the young and the old. How about sports - sports is a rather popular pasttime activity for the younger generation. But it's also an important part of older people's lifes, a point that is supported by the fact that certain activities that have fascinated the older generation first but have now moved on to include the younger generation as well (without of course losing any importance to the older generation, it's like a side-by-side activity) do exist. Sports can therefore be enjoyed by both, the young and the old, and does not leave anyone behind. If you don't feel like jumping down a cliff into the ocean then don't - there's other activities like running, iceskating or, the one I referred to above to illustrate an activity moving down the generational ladder rather than up: nordic walking.
And what about a very different pasttime activity that both, the yound and the old enjoy: going out and enjoying oneself with friends. While the youth has bars, pubs and clubs to enjoy itself, the older generation usually prefers locations with less noise and more atmosphere, yet not necessarily less fun. If one enjoys a nice restaurant or a dance then age doesn't really matter - a 90-year old can enjoy himself next to a 30-year old and both will be having a blast.

Yet another point I would like to make is money and time. It's a known fact that older people, especially retirees, statistically have more money to spend than younger people, who might have to support an entire family of four or more on one single income, do. And unfortunately, in our society money equals fun. A very good example is travelling, which in our society is just another word for seemingly endless enjoyment all over the world. Travelling is quite expensive though, a family of four will not be able to afford a Carribean cruise on a ship, nor will it have time or money for an extended cruise or travels that last longer than a week or two. With more time on their hands older people can usually sit back and relax, enjoy their free time in foreign countries or even at home with their friends.
Which, as my final point, is what I think the most important factor of enjoying oneself. Friends are the salt in the soup, and while older people don't tend to have more friends than the younger generation (true, I don't have any hard evidence to support this, but it has been my general observation in my immediate environment), they usually tend to have closer friends that they have known for decades. Sharing ones life with a life partner or a good friend is what makes life worth living to some people, and in order to do that age doesn't matter - attitude matters.

I think I have made my point clear that I do not think that younger people enjoy life more than older people do. From the outside and from a rather superficial point of view this might seem to be the case, given that according to the media - which unfortunately is made mostly for young people - only young people seem to enjoy life on TV and in the movies. It's a certain stereotype that the movie industry has been presenting us for many years and it seems to have attached itself to our society where age equals boredom and loneliness. Personally I think that if I had a time machine and would be able to look at a 20 years older me I would discover, that the older me would still be having fun in life and enjoying itself just as the young me does right now."
5116,0,"I agree the idea that most advertisements make products seem much better than really are. Let me talk about two reasons.

One reason is that  products in magagine advertisements seem more beautiful than they really are. For example when the beautiful woman  wore a dress in the magagine advertisements the dress seemed so beautihful because of the beauty of this woman. But when I wore the same dress the dress did not seem beautiful. Because I am not  beautiful. Also the shape of the dress changed because I was fat  and the dress was really tiny. I could not realize that the dress was tiny because the beautiful woman in magagine was really thick and beautiful body.

Second reason is that  products in TV advertisements seem more useful than they really are. For example when the famous cook  uses the knife in TV advertisements this knife will seem more useful. Because the famous cook can really can cook very well. But If I or my father buy this knife we will not use knife very well. Because we do not like cooking and we hardly use the knife.

Therefore I think most advertisements make products seem much better than really are."

Now thay may learn about things that they never though about which-in my opinion-will add to thier knowledge alot. There are many studies done recently to know if other subjects being taken by the students outside their specialized area may upgrade their general scors in the exams and improve their understanding in the general scinces. It was found that those students who took several subjects outside their specialized area they do better in their final exams. However, we should not be very opitimistic about this. 
	There are still many academic researches belive the opposit. Some of them think-from their experince- that taking subjects from outside the specialized area bring undesired effects. It was reported that some students who took subjects that are directly related to their sepciliaty are not giveing enough attention to their major courses and actualy they are not concentrating and, therfore, they waste their time and above all extra subjects add nothinhg to their knowledge. Moreover, some academic principles are currently revising this issue in the universities and trying to come to a sort of strategy whether to keep the doors open for any student to take broaden his/her knowledge or put some restrictions on it. In my opinion, if the students take what ewver subject outside his/her speciality this won't bring bad at any how. In fact this will increase the the general information about many thing in the life. 
	In conclusion -and based on my own experince- students should be always encouraged to take subjects from in and outside their area of speciality, but I also feel that more studies should be conducted  to know the exact effect of taking many subjects on the final perfomance and knowledge of the student."

It is less expensive that travel alone because you always pay for the hole trip ( if you pay to a travel agengy for the trip you pay all inclusive: the plane, the tikets, the hotels, the food and they give you the tour guide and the security)
You don't enjoy alone. You are always with peoples. You are always sharing, speeking, talking, laughing. You are never bored. If you go to an interest place the travel guide are going to explain you the history of that place, why they construct that monument, what means, etc. If you don't speak  the language of that country the tour guide can help you to understand the language or he can translate you whatever you want. You can't loose, because they are always taking care of you.
They are going to help you with anything information that you need.

The tour guide is always nice,  if they work alone they will give you the best price ( for you choose them). I think that it is a good option for not travel alone. 

The tour guide is a person that knows a lot about the place that you are visiting in that moment. He is worried about you.

What would happen if one  gets ideas or concepts witout knowing the facts? I think it will lead to the misconception of the people whom one dosen't know. Without knowing the facts, we are not able to know the truth.
	For example, if one sees a black people ,without knowing the facts, if one follows the common ideas and concepts of the black people, one might thinks most  of the black people are uneducated and theifs. Or, if one sees  Mexicans working at the construction, one might thinks thay they are all poor and uneducated. Or one might thinks all Asians are good at math or science, and they all are excellence in their schools.  These are all misconceptions. The people who don't know the facts could misunderstand the people around you. If one knows the facts first before  understands the concepts or ideas of the people, one can't just automatically  put people in certain category like that. Even though the person is working at the construction, I know there are many people who are well educated and not poor. They just choose to work there. I know the Asians who are not good at neither math nor science. If one is able to know the facts, one are able to know the different side of the people which one hasn't known yet.

While in the past, it was a reserved mean, which was prerogative of the richest part of the population , nowadays it is used by almost the 85 % of the world population
The question is: but  Will it remain a successful mean among twenty years or will be replaced ? Or even more, will it disappear?
I think that all depends by the progress of  techonology in fact the improvement of the man's style conditions could allow a new born also in mechanic  field
In fact, the discovering of new electronic elements could bore to a new transportation mean and so render the car useless, but from the other hand this research can't never occur if there aren't fund and so money
In my opinion, between twenty years, the cars in use will be more than nowadays and not fewer, but they will have almostly, new confort and qualities than the recent one. For example they could  have more sophisticated circuit that allow to the driver to orientate whatever is his destination or they would be less polluting than one , perhaps with a non polluted system which convert the carbon dioxide into oxygen preventing all the diseases that characherize the urban citizen
But, on the other hand, if there will be more cars, it would create an overcrowding in the street: all the people who have the car in fact use it almost the daytime and with the crowding of the streets., the man' / women's attitude could change giving origin to some unpleasant events
In conclusion , I think that, if in the future, there will be an increasing of the car, which in my opinion will occur, i hope the people learn to use it in a properly way."
901,0,"Nowadays, most people generally spend a lot of time in their company for their work in daytime. Although they are busy all day long, they have their spare time. I disagree with the position that the young do not have time to helping their communites. For this statement, I have two specific reasons. Helping another people do not need a lot of time and the young should reduce their waste time. 
     First of all, helping people, there are not needed many time. And the important thing is the mind for helping people. For example, in recently, public advertisement expresses the only 3 minutes needed for helping people, for instance, helping the old with the heavey broden when people walk on the street to go to the work in the morning or to go to home at night. 
     Next, if young people reduce their waste time, they can do more meaningful work like helping another poor people. After working, most people tend to spend their time watching television and take a nap. For example, whenever they have a spare time, if they help poor people and older people, they soon feel they are not alone anymore. 
     In finally, the young should have spare time to help their community. They can make time for helping another people."
7497,0,"There has been an argument regarding the issue that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject.  Some people think that studying for one particular subject that they are intrested in is more effective.  From my perspective, however, I believe that learning many different subjects is a more beneficial way of studying.  In this essay, I will present two reasons for holding this opinion.
 First of all, studying various subjects can help students decide their future career.  In general, a lot of students have difficulties choosing their career because they are not certain about their interest.  However, by learning many different subjects, students can find out which subject they are most interested in.  For example, when I was in a college, I took economics because I have always been interested in this subject since I was in high school.  However, I soon realized that I have no skills in managing businesses.  After then, I decided to change my major into psychology and I started to enjoy this class so much and now I am planning to be a pschiatrist.
 Second, learning differenct subjects can broaden one's knowledge. Most people tend to stick to their major when they enter college which narrows their knowledge and experience.  Suppose that one person studied for math for the whole college years.  When that person graduates and get a job, he/she may not have a happy time in his job because he certainly don't know how to interect with others or how to use the computers or machines.

As I mentioned above, more and more jobs need people to have more than one abilities. Such as my major is finance and banking, but if I just be familiar with how the banks operations, it is firely not enough. Because with the developing of the banking system, a lot of new and comprehensive things occered to banks and they have to accept them because of the harsh competition. For example, the bonds relatived to the performance of many companys. We have to have the good knowledge of accouting and mathmatics to do it. It showes that have broad knowledge could meet the requirement.

Have many skills also help us have a broader carrer range. If one only specialize in one specific subject, he or she could only doing one job for his/her whole life. If he/she find the job is boring or not the real things they like to do, there is no chance to change for him/her, which is really regretful. We can easy to turn to other jobs with a broad knowledge and we can solve the problems we meet by more than one method.

I can not imagine that doing one thing all my life.  I love to change. I love the excitement that changes give me.  The changes can make my life colourful and happy. So I choose to have a broad abilities.

The broad knowledge make us do our jobs better as well. Such as with the wonderful logical thinking of maths and good foundation of Chinese, I can make the banking essays more perfect!"
3874,0,"For the development of the world and individuals, broad knowledge and specific knowledge are both important. However, as far as I concerned, I agree with it is better to have broad knowledge than to specialize in one specific subjuect for reasons as following.

First, you can make sure that what you interest in only after you learn  broad knowledge. When you know nothing about something, you do not know if you like or dislike it. So if learning some about the all aspects of knowledge, you can know which aspect you interest in and you can choose the area you will specialize in. This is one of the reasons that why universities arrange many various courses for students to expect them to find their real interest and then prepare for work or further study in the future.

Second, broad knowledge of many academic syjects is the basis of specializing in one specific subject. For example, a biologist must have the knowledge of chemistry, math and so forth. Without any knowlege of other fields, he can not deepen and broaden the research in one specific field and may confront with many difficulties.With the help of broad knowledge, you can think more efficiently and creat some good ideas. 

In addition, the more developed the world is, the complicated the knowledge is. As a result, if you want to reach some accomplishment, you should have comprehensive ability of many aspects. If you only have knowledge of one specific field, you may face many difficulties to handle problems in your work and life.  

In a conclusion, broad knowledge can estabish a good basis for your work or study in one specific subject. You can find your interest and development in learning broad  knowledge."

These wars happening in our world can  be an effect from the cause of imaturity and irrespnosibilty young people nowadays are having towards  the prespectives of their cultures,societies and themselves.

In the old days,Education was one of  important needs poeple might consider. That is because of the great enthusiasim young people might be having towards accomplishing their responsibilties. For example, the precentage of failure in Senior- high shool was 30% in the Middle East between 1989-2000. However, between 2001-2006 the precentage of failure  has been highly increased to 70%. This statistic tells that young people nowadays are not having the potential to accomplish their  reponsibilities, in order to respond it to several generations after them. This also may cause the communitity and the society to have a lack of Education that might effect the city with it's financials.

10871,0,"Lately there has been an ongoing debate over whether or not most advertisements make products seem better than they really are. Some people are of the opinion that ads represent a great opportunity for  manipulation with regard to certain products while others contend that ads cannot change the nature of the products they are presenting and are therefore not manipulative. A close examination of the issue reveals that the statement which asserts that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are is unsubstantiated.

A main reason why such a claim has its limits is the fact that the advertisement industry is regulated. The state decides about what can and can't be said in ads by  legislating about ads and competition. That makes an advertisement susceptible to lawsuits: An angry consumer who thinks that a certain ad has mislead her can sue the advertising company. Since advertising companies are aware of that, they will try not to make false claims about the products they advertise for.

Another reason why the claim about advertisements and their misleading status doesn't hold is that most ads do not actually inform about the products, but that they rather encompass certain images and emotions which are associated with the product they are trying to sell. How many ads about ice-creams include the nutrition facts? The answer is none. And since most ads do not inform anyway, it is impossible for them to make products appear better than they actually are.

Perhaps the most convincing reason why the great majority of ads is not misleading is that an appraisal of a product's quality is in most cases subjective. For instance, some people like onion soup while others hate it.  Some people would immediately switch the channel when they encounter an onion-soup-ad while others probably would enjoy watching it. So, one's perception of an advertisement undoubtedly depends on her subjective attitude toward the product. This subjective attitude would almost certainly affect the degree to which one would find the ad deceptive.

In conclusion, the claim that most ads make products seem better than they actually are is unsubstantiated for three reasons: State regulation, the advertisement's non-informative nature and the subjectivity of advertisement-appraisal."
6283,0,"The issue of whether understanding ideas and concepts is more important to students than learning facts. Some people assert that understanding concepts is more important , while others believe that learning facts is more important. Different people have different views due to their distinct backgrounds.As a matter of fact, this issue is complex and controversal one and whether one choice takes precendence ovr the other may quite depend one the specific situation. As far as I am concerned, I disagree with this statement and my view can be substantiated by the following discussion.
     
       The first argument can be presented is ideas and concepts are usually unrealistic and un-practical. A good example is about my major- physical therapiest. Many of classmates could get good scores in the lecture, but they could not get good scores in the lab or being interns in the hospital because they could make a good connection between what they had learned and the clinic situation.
Under this circumstance, I really think learning facts is very important.
     
      In addtion, there is another reasons to support my standpoint and a good example is not far to seek. Before going abroad, people buy the travelling guide book and understand the environment and culture of the country to which they are going. But sometimes, people feel what the book mentions is too abstract to understand and therefore, the best way is going that country and have the real experience.

      Admittedly, it may be true understanding ideas and concepts is very basic and important for students in some specific situation. However, this alone doesn't constituate a sufficienct support to claim above statement.Actually, these cases are rare and thus are too specific and too weak to strenthen this standpoint.When the advantages and disadvantages of understanding concepts and learing facts are carefully examined, the most striking conclsuion is abvious that learing facts is much more important.
 
      To sum up, although the statement still arouses diagreement among different people, the issue is quite difficut to resolve.Taking  into account the above-mentioned reasonses,which sometimes intertwine to form an organic whole and thus become to be more persuasive,we can arrive at the conclusion learing fact is more important to students than undersatdning ideas and concepts."
9796,0,"Is it better to know a little bit about everyting or everything about one topic? This is a question that every student faces during his academic career. But no teacher will ever answer it for you. In order to find an answer, there are many different levels that must be considered. It will be usefull to look at the effects on the academic life, personal life and personal relationships. Personally I believe that a broad knowledge is much better for most people.

For your private life and personal developement a broad knowledge is more valuable than spezialized knowledge. A broad knowledge helps you to handle all kinds of different situations. You always have an idea what kind of solution may resolve the problem. For example if you have some knowledge about law, you can resolve many problems by yourself without an expensive lawyer. You could also help your friend who would be very gratefull.

Considering personal relationships a broad knowledge normally is more important. Broadly educated people are able to communicate with everyone about everything without getting embarassed. In contrast, people with very specialized knowledge are likely to get a little lonely. They often talk to people with a similar knwoledge. 

If someone wants to become an scientist and do some research, specialized knowledge is much more usefull than general knowledge. These days there is a specialist for everything and it's not easy to find a topic to do research on. You have to know almost everything about your topic. So it's very hard to get a board knowledge besides.

So I think a broad knowledge is much better, unless you want to become a scientis. Broadly educated people perfom better in their private live and are more sociable. They easier communicate with other people about all kinds of topic. But this is a choice that everyone has to make for himself depending on his plans."
2604,0,"Communities always need help from engaged people. They look for young people to organize a kid's club or choirs for example. But communities nowadays have trouble finding young engaged people to help them with their work, I agree with this statement.
	To my mind, some young people are very engaged in community work and are willing to help other people, even today. But in general, I think, young people are more interested in meeting friends, doing sports or work in a job, where they are able to earn extra money. 
	To my mind, young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. One reason, why they are not willing to help in a communtity may be, because it is a lot of work, but they usually will not get money for their work.
	Another reason why young people are not interested in doing community work is because they may seem boring and less exciting to their peers. Young people nowadays have to risk something and have to do fun things to be accepted from their peer group.
	In my opinion, not only the young people nowadays play an important role in not helping the community, but the communities themselves have to become more interesting for young people. They could make the jobs they have to offer more appealing to young people by honoring their work in front of the whole community with certificates, for example. Another point is, that communities could organize more meetings for young people who help. They could offer trips to those and they could try to engage a lot of friends to do the work together. So, not only young people have to be more engaged, but also do communities have to be more creative in order to get  young people's attention.

	As an example, I used to play the piano when I was young. And I always thought that I was good at playing piano and it would be my career in the future. But as I grew up, I experienced that I lost the interest and the joy from playing the piano. After that, I started to learn playing the violin for a year. But it was only interesting at first several months. Then I started to take an art class in school. I used to draw and paint when I was young, but this time I felt the passion and joy from it. Now I look forward to attend in art school. The several art awards that I received are always making me to think learning new things are so important.

Also I joined many clubs in school that I want to do.

For me travel signifies unwinding myself,discovering unknown things and waking up and sleeping when I want to.By giving the tour guide control of this time and lettting him/her run my schedule would be sure shot recipe for ruining my holiday.
From my childhood days I have memories of certain trips I took with my parents where they signed up for group trips with a guide as part of the package I remember being tired and bored at the end of the day. All the places we went to were predictable and crowded.But when there were day trips we made to the beaches around and just lazed and played in the sand it brought me joy and the pictures always were a delight to watch.One exception to this is when we visited a world famous sun temple in India which dates back to several hundred years my father hired a tour guide and he explained to us the meaning of different sculptures and their significance in history since this temple was located in one of the oldest kingdoms in India. 
Now that my husband and I go on holidays together we do not follow any schedule.The last time we went on a vacation unplanned we discovered a safari that was not listed in any of the local attractions.We ended up staying in bamboo huts right on a strip of a private beach with its own kitchen.The adventurer in me will not let me follow any set pattern of visiting famous attractions based on someone else's prediction of what needs to be seen.Of course,if I visit France I will go see the Eiffel tower or any world famous attraction in that city but I may just sit on the side and observe people
As I will grow older and perhaps have more time to travel, I know the wanderlust will not fade away and I would like to travel and explore the world.I also know that while travelling I  will come across diverse cultures and people and their foods and habits.I want to use my travelling experiences to know how and why people live the way they do and while I do that I hope it will help me and my family understand the world in a better way .That is the legacy I want to teach my daughter -of tolerance and understanding for people who dont necessarily eat or look like us. A group travel with a tour guide will definitely not help me achieve this.I would think it will fulfill my role as a part of this world instead of just coming home from a far away place with a momento and a memory of a luxurious hotel."

Advertisement has been always an important notion of that new era in the last decades. Because, industrialization supported with technology will bring also many and more diverse products to our lives. So, advertisement can be accepted as the best way to meet the products to people. You can reach to people by using the screens, radios or even internet. It is a great way to tell everything to people. But, if you use it wrongly, it may cause also great problems for them.

What is the aim of an advertisement is an important question to answer. It is very simple to say that if I like something on TV advertisement, for example a health soap, i will definitely give the decision to buy it. 

But, the advertisement do not tell the everything about the product?  Normally, people believe in the words of the advertisement. After that, they decide to but the product. But, if the owner of the product decides to give less or wrong information about it, in order to make the people to buy more, this may cause unfortunate events. I may have possible allergies to some ingredients of the soap that i did not get from the advertisement.

I do not want believe in that most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are. Even, I'm not aggree with the statement. Although, there will be always bad examples, I know that people will say always the truth to others."
4748,0,"I disagree with the idea that young people enjoy life than older people do. There three reasons for this.
	First of all, there are the good reason just around me. My grandfather and mother really enjoy their life. After my grandfather retired his job, he and his wife often travell all over the world. They like trip very much and they say that traveling is their whole life hobby. It seems to me that they enjoy their life better than me. 
	Secondary, at present, there are a lot of materials, helps and oppotunities for older people to make their life better. For example, university is open for a lot kinds of people like those who working outside university, and  even for older people retired their jobs. There are a lot of people who want to study more even they get ages.
	thirdly, older people have enough time to do what they like to. After they retired their works, I think they can get the prenty of oppotunities and full time to enjoy their life. Although older peolpe have more risks on their health and they may have difficulty to live, I believe that because they have great experiences through their long life, they have also the vigor to beat this difficulties. The older people around me such as my grandfather and grandmother, who I really respect, usually advise me how to live, and how to improve my life when I have a probrem about my life. 
	these are the reasons why I disagree with the statement that old people do not have more enjoyable life than younger people. I think that both of young people and older people can enjoy thei"
1602,0,"The question being raised is if I agree or not to the idea that advertisements make a great impact in products. This is an important issue to consider because advertisement is part of our daily life. Today if you want to sale any product you most think in how to advertise it. I totally agree that a good advertisement in front of your store help your business to attract more people. In order to have this product sale you most develop a good strategy, and follow some rules.

	First of all, to sale products you need good avertisement and a good strategy. That definitly will attract other people to your business, and it will help you to give a presentation of your products. For example, if I have a store that sale house ornament, it is necesary to have all kinds of neon sings that make allusion of the product on sale. Other way is to bring some ornaments outside the store and let people who pass by stop and take a close look. This is 
an strategy that every one can practice.

	Furthermore, to sale product and make then look bettter than they realy are, you do not have be unthrusful. Instead, you just have to follow some rules that are applicable to every business, small or large. The first thing is to put the nicest product at the entrance of the store. This way people will be attracted to the rest of the products. I remember one time I was tried to make a garage sale. At that time what I did was just to follow the old rule. My neighboords started to came, and at the end of the day every thing was sold.

	After all, I agree with the statement that advertisements make product seem more attracted. Even though some people believe they do not needed to sale a product, I would never have good resolt in my little business experiences if I did not used a plan and follow some rules."
11770,0,"Without question I agree the statement that young pepole need to perticipate in their community mpew. There are three resons for it: economical benefit, learning social ability and improving their personality.
      Firstly, helping thir community is purly benefit to economic. If they take part in a non-profit group such as the one keeping environment good condition, the gorvenment do not need to spend the extra money in order to improve the environment. Acording to the survey countries where people help their communities  spend  less money than countries where not so many pepole help their communities. For these reasons, it is certain that we need to make young people help their comunities.
     Secondly, helping communities enables teenagers to learn social ability. I used to help home which is for the old. Before helping it, I did not know how to comminicate with old pepole. However, by helping them I begin to learn how to speak to old pepole and also I also understood that it is really important to talk with old people. But for this experience, hardly would I learn social ability.
     Lastly, young people are able to grow by helping community. My brother was used to be really rude. However, he become far more humane bny doing it. From this experience, I maintain that the more they take part in communities, the better their personality become.
     For resons above, I would have to say that helping society is really important. Nevertheless, recently young pepole do not spend time in taking part in communities. Consequently, they need to spend more time in participating in communities."
7880,0,"I disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. Although traveling in a group with a guide does have advantages for people who are not used to traveling, I think traveling by individuals is far more interesting and challenging. Here below are the reasons.
 First of all, if you travel with a group, it is likely that the travel agency offers you only several choices of hotels. Whereas if you book on your own, you can chose from a vast list of hotels that most suits your taste.  You would probably have to dine in large restaurants mosty for tourists because local food establishment where they have delicious food tend to lack space to host a group.
 Another inconvenient factor of traveling with a guide is that you cannot chose the sites you would like to visit. Usually, the guide would take you to the most popular tourist sites, and not to the less famous but fascinating places. You would also have limited time to spend at each site. 
 I believe the most wonderful thing about traveling is that you get to meet people from all over the world, but if you travel in a group, you are less likely to interact with other travelers. I visited Spain this September on my own, and became acquainted with travelers from US, France, Morocco, and China on the train and at football stadiums, and we exchanged information on the best places to visit. I still correspond with one of them."
9428,0,"On the first part, we have to know what is an advertisements, if there is many type of them. What they may products? 
Let begin with an exemple of advertisements that we can see every day: smoking kills. this is a good advertisements cause we do know that it is not healthy to smoke and however, there are a lot a persons they do that. So, if we continue with this exemple we can proove alos that the fact of reading on your box of cigarettes that it kills gave the opportunity to a good numbers of persons to stop it. 
the problem with that word advertisements is its type, the destination of the advertisement, who makes it and what should be the effects on people. 

In the foreign affairs, a crisis situation can conduct to advertisements from a country to an other. We can read that everyday in the newspapers that the UN are giving advertisements to a country like Iran or North Correa about their own nuclear program. The message has been delivrated but did it help, this is an other question. 

On the other hand, there is a familiar expression wich is : an advertising man is like two men. It means that when you have been advertising of something by someone, you are that much cleaver than Two of yourself. It can illustrate very well the question. 

To conclued i can say that i do not agree with this sentences cause i think that is the experience that can make products, real products."
7485,0,"yes i agree with statement. Because young people are at stage of the life.so, this people will enjoy alot compare to old people.whereas old people enjoyed at that age but not now.
But, nowadays young people enjoy  more than old people enjoyed.
Reasons are:
young people are in good health and they are very flexible to any kind of environment.As they are younger naturally they are in a position to do any thing like playing, dancing, drinking.whereas old people can do all this thing, no it is not possible.
young people wil enjoy with friends going with friends and spendingf time with friends in chating ,etc., roming here and there.
Enjoying the holidays in othere country with friends , parties.
 where as coming to old people they cannot move any were because, as they become old there health will not support to move to the other places or the environment doestnot suite there health. They could not enjoy at this age.
Coming to the young people they can adjust anywere , they can do any thing because until there body permits. young people will enjoy alot compare to the old people because there are lot many changes in present days compare to previous days.keeping present days in view we can say that young peoplle will enjoy many things .
Young people will enjoy by attending parties and coming late nights 
to house or going for a lomg ride, going with friends for picnic . enjoying weekend parties with friends or official parties etc.
enjoying all the taste and entering into each and every corner to taste the thing or to no about the place. if they found a new place they will reach there and they enjoy re they know about thaty place.
Hence i conclude that young people will enjoy more than old people by saying above reasons and with examples."
1301,0,"There are two different aspects which makes the question difficult to answer if it is better to have broad knowledge or to specialize in one specitic subject. 
At first if you study undergraduate it is neccesary to get a lot of information from diffrent academic subjects. Because you do not know anything about that subject you study and so you have to lern a lot. You have to learn practical things like how to prepare an essay or how do i have to work out my letters for the proffesors or maybe how can i regestrade me in the system at the university. Also you have to learn a lot of stuff to get the ability to talk with someone around your topic.It is necessary to know the topic.I will give an example if you are studying architecture you have to know how to build a house if you do not know this it makes no sence to learn other things like interior design.So  If you do not kmow basics you can not go on futher. Therfore i found it very importent to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects.
Second if you are a graduate student who know the pasics he can consentrade on speciffic subjects. Maybe for interrior design or special concrets. In the upper classes i would say  you have to specifies your topic.
However at the end i have to say that it gives no genuraly answer on this question. It depense on you life situation."
5445,0,"In the past, the cars had developed from a luxury skill to a usual material. Now, there are a lot of cars getting more modern. Also, there are many car companys  and factories which build more cars.

Now, there is a statement claiming that in twenty years there will be a fewer cars in use than there are today. 
But I disagree with that. The car developed in more than a hundred years to an usual thing, from 1886 to now. And it's still developing in this time! Many factories build more cars to get more money, because everyone has a cars or more than one. For some people cars are like friends and they them need them for a show-off. When people want to go to another place, they use their comfortable car to get there. So, the factories cannot stop building more cars in the next twenty years, because they want more money. 
Because of the polluted enviroment more modern cars are build which need liquid gas what doesn't pollute the air. So, this is another reason for the factories who cannot stop building new cars, because they have to design new ones, too.

I think, to have fewer cars in use on the streets we need more than twenty years, because in this time people still need their cars either for a show-off or for comfortable moving. Also, it took more than a hundred years to develope and when it will go back, it cannot go faster, in my opinion.
If the statement claims that in sixty or seventy years fewer cars will be in use than today, not in twenty years, then I would agree to it."
9724,0,"Everyone is looking forward to be successful person. In order to be successful you should have a lot of  a good chacteristics. You sould be a competitive, an avid, intelegent, strong, wise and challenger person, also you should have the ability to learn any thing new even if you dont like it. Moreover, you have to be a brave person, so you will not afraid from having risks.

	Some successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.
In my opinion, i agree with the person who tries new things because of several things. First of all, of course when you try something new you will increase your exprience and your knowledge. For example, one day my administratore asked me to prepare a presentation with power point program because he beleved that i know how to work well with that program, but i made a decision to take a risk by useing a new stronger  and difficult program.Finaly, I have done that presentation perfectily and successfully. One more example, when  i face any hardware or software problem with my computer, i will not ask any person to help me. instead of that I  will try to solve that problem myself. According to that, i will have a lot of experience in the computer field.

   At the last, as far as i am concidered, the life require from the people to learn new things , to have risks, to increase their experience and their knowledge. Otherwise we will not be able to survive in this life."
5362,0,"Everybody will admit that a birthday celebration with young people is generally more cheerful, colorful and full of fun than a birthday with older people. Same goes for a sports event, a concert and into many social activities. Therefore, it could be said that young people enjoy life more than older people do because they have more means for that.  These three means are eagerness, health conditions and new opportunities provided by technology.

First, young people are eager to live. They are hungry for life.  They could travel all over the world, try new sports and meet new people. They have not consumed the joys of life. They are not prudent and ready to take risks which hopefully increases enjoyment. However, older people are generally static both in mind and pysically. They have rules set for their life. There are nothing much left for them to discover. Discovery itself is a big enjoy and young people could easily discover.

Second, young people's health conditions provide them that joy. When they got home from school or work, they do not feel any aches like the elderly do. Even they drink a lot on the previous night, they find the stamina to get up and continue their life, whereas older people suffer from countless sickness even in their normal days. Poor health conditions, which most of the older people have, is a great barrier to enjoy life.

Thirdly, for every new young generation, there are more opportunities to enjoy life than the older generations since there have been a lot improvements in communication technology and transport. Fourty years ago it was almost impossible for an American girl to meet with an Indonesian boy. With the improvements in computer technology, a lot people have a lot of friends in different continents whom they shared their feelings, expectations and so on. Therefore, their taste for life increases. They could also easily to travel in order to meet these people face to face. There are much more planes travelling all around the world. No one could argue that finding and getting together with the people you understand each other is 

In conclusion, even though there are exceptional older people who could enjoy life, I agree with the idea that young people have more opportunities to enjoy and they certainly do."
703,0,"In my opinion i disagree with the topic about most advertisements make products seem much better than really they are.In this new global world and  era the companies try to reach so many people around world by the use of technology.But it can be sometimes harmful for the consumers who do not pay attention.

	Firsty of all there are too many ways to attract consumers about the product.We can use internet, tv, radios, by giving advertisements.All of them are effective.by using a famous footballer or model you can increase  the popularity of the product.On the other hand, the companies use cameras and light illusions to show the product more attractive. Also this method can be used for showing the big one as a little and the slow one as a huge one.An addition to this mechanisms the advertisment given on tvs or internet are repeated so many times in order to persuade and convice the consumers.this made pressure on the consumers to try the product.the last factor for me to attract the consumers about the product is its price.As we know if a product is cheap we always think that it is the best suitable one for us.It i a quite wrong stetement in fact.Thus the companies know this situation and use it as a most well known weapon.

	In spite of the stated facts below, there are also some advertisement reclects the obvious and fair appearance and usage of a product.In such kind of situation we can try to companies mark on it.For example some marks like bmw, general electrics, lcw are most well known producers so we can trust their product also advirtisements.


	Consequently, in our global and technologic world all companies try to take a role in world trade and make much more money.Furthermore we can say thet worlds management is related with some big companies. So the smaller ones try to be in this huge budget.And also they can do everything to get this even they force the countries to begin a war.Attractive  products to convince people are an easy piece of cake for them."
7520,0,"I totally agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.

In my observation from the successful businessmen or professors, they often do things or sucjects what other people do not understand at all.  For example, ten years ago, while most people do not know values and benefits of the computer, but Bill Gates knew it.  Because he went ahead and tried the new things(computer), he made a real big fortune from doing latest technology.

On contrary to those persons who only do what they known, successful persons are always trying new things.  They usually have a open mind to absorb all the latest concept, and they often take risks.  For instance, if a businessman adopt the idea that he never heard before, it must be very risky to use it if the idea is not pratical to operate.

There will be two different ways for using the new thoughts: success or fail.  Most people will not dare to adopt new things because they are afraid that they may lose everything.  In this way, they gradually developed the idea that  they do not want to learn the new things and take advantage of them.   

In contast, this idea seldom be formed in the heart of successful people.  They, of course, know the risks might be, but they are not afraid.  Successful people usually have a positive mind to keep them go ahead.

In conclusion, I think that I truly agree the opinion that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well."
1950,0,"When asked about what kind of knowledges is good for a person's life. Many people may hold the issue to  learn as much as specialized knowledeg in one specific subjuect and think that is a prime argument. But, some people, however, are taking a fresh look at it. As far as I am concered, I agree with that it is better to have broad knowlege of many acadeemic, although there may several merits to specialize in one sepecific subject, for example, more expertized and more deeply knowledge.Among countless reasons that influence my opinion, there are three conspipuous aspects mentioned follow.
We may look into every possbile reason, however, the foremost one is that a broad knowledge is good for fitting to the developing of the world today. Nowadays, people could get as much as informations from many different methods. They should have the ability to be familiar to huge informations and treat them correctly. And if they want to reach that level mentioned above they must owe many different knowledge of a great deal of subjects.
Also, it may be arbitrary to juge my preference only to use the argument mentioned in the above paragraph. There is another reason that deserves some words here. For individule perspectivity, a broad knowledge will give person more choices for career. They can choose many different areas to develop their own business. And they can use the broad knowledges to help them make more successes and that will be much easier for them to exert the broad knowledge in a whole.
Last but not the least reason is  that the broad knowlege will give person more opportunities to meet different people with different academic backgrouds. They will communicate with them more freely ,and may make friends with them that will be good for their future lives and careers.
Taking into account of all these reasons mentioned above, we may easily reach the conclusion that it is much better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects ,"
7811,0,"The way for many students to reach good results is to learn facts and reproduce them when they are asked to. In general, I never was a friend of just learning facts without understanding the background. But I must agree, that it depends on the topic, which is the best way to learn. 
When learning a language for example, you have to learn the vocabulary. Or when studying medecine, you can't get along without just learning the whole anatomy. The same case is when learning about history, there are some facts that you just have to keep in your mind. But: It's only the preparation to be able to work. You will work with the anatomy or the historical facts, that you learned.

I think, it is much more important to understand the idea of an concept. That is the only way, to be critical with ideas, to think about it and maybe even to innovate or improve it.
At the week-end, I'm an instructor of First Aid at the German Red Cross. I never say to the participants of my courses: That is the perfect way to handle a medical problem. As an example, I would like to tell about the ""stabile Seitenlage"", which probably can be explained as laying a consciousless person in a stable way on the side. Very important to me is to make the people understand, what are the dangers of loosing their mind. And to solve these problems, we think about possibilities against these dangers. Finally, the technic called ""stabile Seitenlage"" is a proposition of me, how the dangers of beeing ""bewusstlos / consciousless?"" can be handled. But if a person has understand WHY ""Bewusstlosigkeit"" is dangerous and what can be done against it, he is always able to find a solution even when he can't remember the technic of the ""stabile Seitenlage"".

For an ingenieur, who wants to ameliorate for example a car, it is not enough to know about the facts of the car... 60 hp, maybe 1.100kg and so on. He must have understood the idea of the concept, how the car works, to be able to change anything.

In summary, I think you always have to learn some facts and keep them in your mind first, but when you want to reach at a higher level, you absolutely must see ""behind"" the facts, you have to understand the concepts and ideas.
And often, you have to understand the concept only once, and you can solve any problem by logical thinking. You can learn all the results of mathemathical terms by heart, or understand one time, how the calculator functions :-)"
9306,0,"I agree; because many academic subjects are going to improve the knowlege of the students, to get more information in regard to what does happen arround the word; in addition the other subject that are not on the major is to make the students how can their specific subject contibute to others areas.

    The first idea is to get more information that the academic people had gotten in a specfic subject. this is important because the students would be interested in regard to others assignatures like politics, economics, urbanism, etc. Those assignatures are called ""General Subjects"". Then when the students study those subjects, they learned about what happened arround the world. This means what are the causes that the facts success and the consequences (good or bad) these gave. For example: In my country, my major is Computer Engineering and the last term I learned about the Urbanism, and the progression of the cities arround the world, the causes of these progresses in regard to the health and organization abuot the building and houses.

  The results to this topic is to improve the student in regard to how can the specifics subject contribute to these. This is the best part, because it make to built the answers in regard to the fact. In addition in my example: I can to reorganize the reality of the city, to help the government housing plan; other could be, to vreate a tridimensional video to help the urbanism professors, experts and/or students; or build a video-game about the race, war, trip, etc.

	To enjoy life, I think it should be only one thing to do. Have friends! This is the most important thing people should do when they want to enjoy their lives. This dosen't matter either the person is young or old. So I disagree with the sentence.

	Having a conversation with friends will make my life much more enjoyable. I always feel that 'friends' are my treasure. In other words, friends will be the key to enjoy life. When I be alone by myself, I need to enjoy just by myself which is very hard to do. If I am with my friends, I could laugh saying joke or having girls talk. Also, I could reduse stress having a conversation or complaining about the problems I have.

	Having less stress in life will make our life enjoyable, as well. Therefore, I think we should have at least a little stress in our life to spend time more valuable. When we don't have stress at all, we can't understand the people who had stress or we will waste time for not having a stress. But when we have to much stress, we can't focus on the things we should do or need to do.

	Having a good meal will also make our life better. When people get hungery, especially me, we will get angry and won't have enough space in our feelings to enjoy something. For having a happy life, our stomache should be happy like us. 

	Having a hobby is important like others. I love to play soccer and I've been playing for more than ten years-including few year when I didn't. This hobby makes me very happy and satisfied with the life I have. The most important thing of having a hobby is that we could be coneccted with others who has a same interest. I had many friends from the same soccer team, which makes my life enjoyable because of the first reason. Maybe when I get old, it  might be impossible to play soccer, but still I can talk about soccer with my friends!

	There is no reason that old people won't have an enjoyable life like youngers. We could have same great life if we try to enjoy ourselves. I think the people who are not enjoying their lives are not trying to enjoy. I am enjoying my life-following the reason I think I should do to"
6675,0,"Although a lot of people believe that young people enjoy life more than older peolpe, i strongly disagree this belief. Enjoying the life doesn' t depend on people's age because it depends on people's vision, expectation from life, and spirit.

Even though  some people become young and, they aren' t happy with life in that their vision is not enough to be happy. They think that some small obsctacles prevent them to be happy. For instance, I know a lot of old people they try to enjoy the life though they have some disablities. They are attend many activities to learn new things and have a good time. These are normal for them because this is their vision.

People expectations from the life change when they are different age. Older people believe that the most important thing is in the life is to be happy and they try to be happy during their older age on the grounds that they know better than young people that life is really short and they are doing their best during this time unlike young people.

Lastly, people's spirit is the other essential factor in people lives. To be younger person is not important. This only provides people some advantages. For example, to  spend more energy and do many things in a short time  but  old people organize their lives to do  more things (like trip, sports, etc..) to enjoy the life. 

Consequently, to be happy is not really related with people age. There are other significant factors affects"
6776,0,"We all have been in traffic jams and mostly it is due to the fact that the number of cars increased a lot recently, rather than that it is because of roads. Due to the imporevements in manufacturing technologies, it has become possible to produce cheap cars in shorter times. In return, the number of cars increased. Toyota now can produce a car in 2 minutes with a cost of 2000 dollars, less or more , of course depending on the type of the car. This indicates that as technology developes more and more, people will buy more and more cars. So in the following 20 years, in my opinion,  there will be more cars instead of the possibility that there will be fewer cars been driven than we drive today.
One reason for the possible increase in number of cars within close future is, as aforementioned, the technological improvements enable manufacturers to produce cheaper cars in shorter times. Cheaper cars mean that almost everybody can have it. Attracted by extra promotions and suitable purchasing conditionos, even a family can have more than one car. And this attraction that the manufacturers present for their customers will be even more attractive as technology contunies to improve, as a result; more automobiles will be on the roads.
Other than that cars are getting cheaper, the people are getting richer as well. The economies of countries grow with the impact of globalization, especially in develop and developing countries, which in turn brings money to people, and I can say that the globalization is just starting. So what can be done with the money ? Of course if you have a house, you will buy a car; if you have a car why should not your wife or son have a car next . It can be seen that having automobile is not accepted as luxury property in some countries, especially in develloped ones. And considering the population of develoding countries and they are going to be developed, there will be a significant incline in  the numbers of cars.
Also there can be disadvantages of driving a car in the next coming 20 years. the time consumed in traffic jams, and environmental problems related to pollution can disatract people, or even laws can be decided by goverments that are limitating automobile usage or number of cars in a family. But all these will not stop the increase in the number of cars, at least 20 years.
To conclude, it can be said that cars are getting cheaper and people are gettin richer in the follawing 20 years due to technologicalso the world is going to be wealthier and cars, of course, are the best canditates to show the wealth a person have. therefore, I believe that number of cars will increase."

    First and foremost, the number and the size of the community itself has dimminished. In the modern society, mobility of the people  has increased and the oppotunities of the transfer because of changing job have rapidry  increased. Therefore, the community is dimminishing so that there are few oppotunities for young people tto attend helping their communities.
    In adittion, young people are becoming more and more independent of their communities.  Highly developed transportaions or telecommunications reduced the neccecity of the community. The dependence on the community increase the motive to contribute to the community. Therefore,  the less young people depend on their communities, the less they want to help their communities.
    Last but not least, developing social welfare are taking place of the help of young people in the community. Some decades ago, to help the elderly or the poor in each community, the help of young and tough people was vital. However, in the modern society,  to care for the elderly or the poor is the domain of the goverment. Therefore, the community itself doesn't need young people's help.
    In conclusion,  the role of young people in the communities has been little value and the role of the communitied for young people has, either. Therefore, not only the motive of young people to help their communities has be less, but also the opptunities to do so has also been reduced. What to be blamed is not only young people."
2492,0,"I agree that ""successful people try  new things and take risks rather than only doing what they are already know how to do well"". As we are in the 21 century, the world is fast changing, so we need to keep learning new things so that we can keep up with the world's step. If someone wants to be susseccful, only follow the others is definitly not enough. A successful man, a talent, must know have to lead behind the people, he must always be one step faster than the ordinary people, thus taking risks is quite necessary. Only follow the traditions and rules and do the things ""what they already how to do well"" will never make people successful and even may destroy them, makes them the ones how can not follow the changing world. People should not hesitate to take risks. Talents take risks, they never afriad of losing because it will only make them stronger. No one can deny that Thomas Edison is a successful man. He is probably the most famous inventor of the world; he is the father of modern light. What does a inventor do everyday? He takes risk. If Thomas Edison has not invented modern light, the world will be complete different today. Another example of successful people try new things and take risk is founder of Microsoft Corporation, Bill Gates. He has studied in a famous university but he has stopped doing ""what he already know how to do well"". He has quited from the university and has started his own business. Now, he is the richest man is the world. He owns billions of dollars and everyone who has a personal computer use his ""Windows"" software program. He is successful and he takes risks. ""Only doing what they already know how to do well"" only makes people nobodies. Every year, millions of skilled and experienced old worker in developing countries like China, retire from factories. They have kept doing their works, ""what they already know how to do well"" every workday. When they finally retired, they have found that they are nobodies and are not successful at all. It is their fault that they have not taken risks. If they have started business or got other creative ideas, they may have much better lives now. In conclusion, successful people are more likely to take risks."
11875,0,"I do not agree that younger people enjoy life more than older people do. Altough young people are physically more active and healthier then the older, thus, may have more energy to engage in enjoyable activities, older people have also some advantges of the old ages provide them.

Young poeple are energetic and active, hence,  often dominate most of the daily life activities we see around. However, when compared to older people, younger ones have more responsibilty, which hinders their opportunity to enjoy life. For example, I and my sister are working in full time jobs,  which make us to spend all day in work. Besides that, we are studying for graduate degrees and this takes most of our free time. However, my granparents who are now enjoying their retirement years, spend their days with shopping, wandering around, travelling and hosting family members in the weekends. 

Another advantage older people have is that they have been cared by other family members more than the younger ones have been. In my culture, senior people are highly respected. They have been consulted for experiences they have and for the knowledge they acquired throughout their life span. That is, they are often visited by familty members, by relatives,which is giving them opportunity to interact socially even sometimes more then young people do. 

One other point is that having developed a mature taste of preferences, older poeple do not spend time trying new things spend their times in a more quality way. Yet, young people generally like trying new things as if they have not developed  permanent life preferences. In other words, young people can be thought as they are still in their life cycle, which can be characterized by flcutuations in tastes and preferences.

 Therefore, I cannot agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do. Both age groups have their own advantages and disadvantages. While young people may be healthier and more active than old people, older people can enjoy many different aspects of life. The more important thing is that regardless of the age you are in, one should know how to enjoy life."
10682,0,"In our society, where advertisements are everywhere, one can wonder if companies do not try to convince us that some of their products are much better than what they really are. We will first discuss why it is sometimes true, then why companies cannot really cheat, and finally, we will explain why it has no real importance in our society.

	It is a commonly shared idea that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. As a matter of fact, the aim of an advertisement is to sell a product. Therefore, when a company wants to sell a product, it can be more efficient to make potential customers believe that it is better than what it really is. In our society, for example, design is widely used to make us buy things that we do not really need : the lack of efficiency of a product can be hidden by its design, or by the pictures and text shown in the advertisements. For example, companies like Apple greatly rely on design to sell them products. One can wonder : ""Why does this company need so to spend so much in advertisement? Is the product not worth its cost?"". Obiously, the way some products are presented in advertisements make them appear better than what they really are : advertisements for pastas always shows them cooked with delicious sauces ; advertisements for burgers always show us big, perfect burgers, whereas everyone knows they do not look at all like this when we go to Mac Donald's!

	But on the other hand, cheating with the actual quality of a product is not effective in a long term commercial strategy. Obviously, people who bought a product because they believed it was much better than what it effectively is, will not buy it another time. This is why companies know that they cannot cheat too much. Moreover, there are several laws concerning advertisement : lying in an advertisement is forbidden for instance. For examples, we can see on old Guiness advertisements, ""Guiness is good for you. Gives you strength"". Such advertisements, which were common in the early 1900s, has completely vanished because laws have been voted to prevent this.

	The most important think is, i believe, that as we all perfectly know our society, we all more or less know when advertisers lie to us and when they do not. Even we often see monsters jump out of cereals on the television (like for instance the tiger from Frosties), we know that it will not happen for real. In the same way, we do not believe that some product will remove every kind of dirt on any clothing."
11271,0,"Most advertisements make products better than they really are is a strong statement that gives quite a pessimistic view on marketing in general. Different companies uses advertise products in different ways some of which may seem illecit, subliminal messages, but the purpose of advertisements is not always to illustrate the quality of a product, but it's importance in our daily life.
It is in the companies greatest interest to glorify their products, but it is also in their interest to make sure that the product actually works.
It is obvious that an advertised product will work better then the actual product because there are factors affecting the product that may cause malfunctionings.The way an advertise is made, the components of the product and the users cautiond about the product will give different results on the functioning of the product.
Advertisements are done in many ways: writing, visually, subcontiously, and on a auditory level. Visual advertisements are presented to us by video and fotografical commercials in which the product is in its best conditions, it is new and a times is presented as a digital object something unreal, basically a drawing. Advertising through wtiring may be risky in that the opinions may differ. On a subconsciouse level we will accept the commercial itself and find it great so it is us that find advertisements better than the product.
Again the conditions of a product on an advertisement are perfect while one might find malfunctions in the product as it may have been dameged by time, transport and our misuse of it. All components of the product are key factors in the functioning of the product a new product will always be better than an old one.
Man error is a major cause in one agreement in the statement. What our brain makes us believe may differ what we experience and believe.
Concluding, it is not the advertisement that makes product look better but it our way of thinking that prevents us from seeing the true reasons why advertised products are better than owned products."
9457,0,"I do agree with the statement. But I have to moderate my claim. Coming out of the University, I can see I have learn a lot of things, and I have forgotten an equal number of it. What will stay after passed years? The ideas, and the concepts. In courses, it,s really important to learn a way to think. Not the same as the professor's one, but its own one guided by teachers experience.
So, is the knowledge unusefull? Certainly not. In order to develop his own way to learn, the student needs strong basis. If he doesn't have good instalements, his science building is going to fail. In the elementary school, we already have to set up those strong basis. Otherwise, the only way to build up a good mental structure is to receive examples to learn. How to understand a car is riding without knowing how works an engine. The knowledge is also important to be able to make connections between different areas, to compare some stuffs. As an archeologist discovering some news objects. He needs to know how was the environment, the atmosphere to figure out how those objects could be usefull for peoples who lived there.
In Belgium, we have this big issue in the high school level. Actually, we try to reduce the knowledge of students and to give us more skills an abilities. But the college professors start to mean their students come into their courses with too big lakes. So, there is an emergency in finding the best middle way between pure knowledge and skills. I think that the more we grow up, the more we have to leave knowledge to get a lot of abilities and concept. At the and of college, student get very various jobs and have to learn again what is typically needed for their domains. So we never stopped to learn, and college is there to give us concpets."
8710,0,"I disagree with this sentence up to a point.

   In my opinion successful people leads the world, and thanks to their works and abilities our world is evolving every day, every minute, every year.

In the world's history many examples of famous scientits, politicians, artists and so one can proove that witout their talent our civilization would be much more primitive.
Christophe Colomb was a famous sailor of the past centuries, he was a risk taker and that characteristic of his behaviour have conducted him to discover America although his life and all the crew was is danger...

  Successful people are never satisfied of themselves that is why they always want to look further, to have new projects more and more insane. 
The curiosity and the risk keep them alive, they need it .
The wolrd won't be so fantastic if people would all be cowards!

Ernesto Che Guevara was a good dorctor in south America but his political ideas were so strong that he leaved everything to join the Cuba's revolution. No matter what he has done, he tried new thing and paid with his own life...

Successful people are the motor of our civilization and we should let them free to do what they want, they may solve some worldwide problems, deseases.... No matter the risks they undertake  if the purpose of their actions is fair, we need them to keep on evolving ."
4575,0,"Attitudes towards the behaviour of young people of not having enough time nowadays  for helping their communities vary from community to community.I think that young people spend equally the same time as before  except that  their efforts are not highlighted as they get  out-numbered.
Previously within every commuinity a small number of people used to be there offering services thereby substantiating that with the increase in population the number of youngsters have increased and their efforts are cnot realized lets take example of community service programmes which are organised by the schools and in some schools it becomes a mandatory part of the curriculum this proves a great part of the student body participating in the community service apart from this we see students collecting funds  every month for the maintainance of the of the community .Most of the  members of the community center are young individuals 
Obviously we cannot expect every student to give in the same kind of effort in this area with the growing complexities in the student life the students eventually land up compromising on the time for the community work during exams but eventually compensate on this lost time by organising camps during their work therefore it would be wrong on our part to undermine their efforts as mentioned before the form in which help is being given by them varies. 
 Perhaps the students might not be channelized in their efforts to helping their communities they need to be more organized in their approach. Help can again vary informs some people dont offer help unless they are asked for it others however are generally helpful and offer help if need be even when they are not asked for it .For example an old lady crossing the road might be helped by an individual even without asking for it whereas others would normally wait for the lady to ask for help as they are hesitant in offering it as they think it might go unwelcomed fearing the senility of the lady
I think todays youngsters are well aware of the responsiblities that are levied on them .Its just the perspective of seeing things that creates the difference.The young are aware that they are the presidents,doctors etc of toommorow and hence are actively participating in offering their services its just that we need to start appreciating their work."
68,0,"Cars can be found easily in the world nowadays. The first thing that Korean college students usually buy these days are cars. Because the world is becoming more globalized and mobilized, some people believe that in the near future as near as in twenty years, there will be more cars than there are right now. However, I strongly disagree with that opinion for two reasons; firstly because the air pollution problem in earth is too critical, and secondly, people will make inventions that will replace cars in the future.
	First of all, Cars will be fewer in twenty years because it generates too much air pollution. Because of cars, the air consists carbon-dixoided too much. This phenomenon is causing the world to destruction. Global-warming is becoming a more of a reality because of cars. The UN and many other associations are stressing with this problem and they are finding a way to stop air pollutions. Thus, because cars are one of the highest priorities of causing air pollution, they will be decreased in the near future.
	Secondly, Many inventions are now being made to replace cars. Technology is advancing in a very frightining speed and in this rate, people may be able to use other vehicles as their primary transportation. Also, public transportations like subways and trains that run by fuel other than fossil fuel are being constructed rapidly everywhere. Even right now people in Korea are considering that public transportations are better than cars in various ways; economical, social, political and etc. By this rate, in twenty years there won't be a place that is impossible to go to by public transportation.
	In conclusion, In two decades there will be fewer cars in use than right now because firstly, air pollution problem has become something so critical that cars may eventually disappear slowly in the future, and secondly, considering the technological advancement rate as an evidence, inventions in the future and public transportation will replace the role of cars. Nowadays, hybrid cars that use hydrogen and electricity are being manufactured. However, studies have shown that this method is very negative economically because when the hydrogens that will be used for fuel are divided from other parts that consist H2O(water), it uses up up to 4 times the energy it later generates. Solar power cars are also making no progress these days. Its time to throw away whats now useless and invent new things that will bring a better way to mankinds lives."
9754,0,"This is a very interssting question. The answer to this questions is not easy.

After my first thought I do not agree to this statement. In these days almost everybody has his own car. It is very confortable driving in your own car, you do not depend on others or on public transportation. I prefer driving by car, because I can descide spontanious what I would likt to do and where I would like to go. Sometimes it is even cheaper driving by car, than taking public transportation, like bus or train. While going on vacation, you can also descide using the bus, train, plain or even your car. Mostly it is cheaper driving by car. These are some examples why driving cars are could be better than using public transportation.

We are not allowed to forget:Technologie is rising very fast these days. At the moment the automobile industrie ist trying to develop a motor, that does not spend gas. They are looking for different kind of ressources. The plan is to keep cars, but make them work with electric or solar energy for example. So if they spend another 5 years on developping a new motor for cars, i do not think they will be able find different sources for transportations besides cars so fast. 

Reasons for cars getting fewer and fewer in the future could be the rising prices, not only on cars, but also the oil prices. Driving your own car is already very expensive. First of all you must have enough money to buy the car. That ist not it. You must also plan the costs that are related with buying a car, like taxes, insurance and gas. The gas price has been raised since several years and will probably still rise the next years. This makes car driving even more expensive. So if people start thinking about their money in a more serious matter, they will think about really buying a car or saving the money.  

But maybe there will be some inventions in the future that will change all our expectations. Maybe we will be able to fly by ourselves in small planes or in some kind of rockets. The imagination is big, the sky is the limit. I could even imagine that nobody will drive cars in 20 years, because we will be flying, not driving anymore.

So it really depends on how the development of inventions for the future are. But if everything stays like it is and we keep using our cars as we do now, I do not agree to the statement above. Our population is getting bigger and bigger, the streets are getting fuller and fuller and the car industrie is making more profits than ever! There are so many new cars build year for year, that I do not think there will be fewer cars in twenty years."
5267,0,"The utmost intention of school lessons is to provide the pupil with the sufficient understanding and knowledge that they can make their way in the sometimes rough and high demanding world. This suggests that pepole learn to get along with problems coming up and they should thereby retain the things they learned during school time. As the issues in your life differ quite much from those examples which an average pupil learns at school, I highly agree with the statement that it is more important to learn concepts and ideas rather than to retain simple facts. I will highline my reasons to  believe this in the following passages.
First off, as I already mentioned above it is highly likely to face a situation it which you are demanded to apply your knowledge on different topics. Therefore the understanding of ideas and underlying schemes is crucial. As an simple example there are signs and rules you ought to have learned during acquiring the drivers licence. Other countries obey different traffic rules but maybe use the same signs. So you are able to adjust to the new challenges and go along with the traffic ideas.
Secondly, understanding ideas broadens your mind and challenges it simultanouesly. You are much more likely to see connecting and corresponding points in an interdisciplinar matter and thus you are able to gain quicker insight into new fields or topics. This can elevate your understanding of miscellainious issues.
At third, understanding ideas and concepts may constitute the basis and platform for vital discussions among students. If you have gained the crucial point of what a topic is all about you are able to exchange thoughts and can thereby help others to apprehend the problem or even take benefit for yourself by reconsidering your own opinion. 

Overall I am a strong believer in the didactic target to catch the ideas rather than to retain pure facts. By shaping the peoples mind this method is much more effective to prepare students to find their way in the challenging world. It may be that due to this assumption this concept is the underlying structure and principle of all sophisticated schools."
6724,0,"There is one or two thing make a country more powerfull and more beatiful. On of them is young people in the country. If they can work for their communities  good they can make their country very beautiful too. However i think its so hard to set young people for this type actions. Because they grow up so stupidly and so lazy. They have been train from their parents to act like these.
	At this time young people start to think their self more than  otherthing when they are a little child. They force their family to do their wants with crying and other things to whichs are family dont see in their child. They act like this beause families dont give them to thinkings to understand what happened in the world and what should them do to survive in this wolrd. They grow up and enter a world which they dont know to live with. They are not ready to see real world how can they live in this world. They did more thing when they are growing but they dont give time to understand  their communities.So how can they help to their communities even if they dont know their communities requirements.Howevet i think this is not young adults faults. This is their parents fault, this is fault of who manage their country or their world.
	Because of all of these young people do not give time to helping their communities. Yes i accept this 's not all of their faults.They can easily trained to be good child,good citizen and so good people.We can solve this problem with some formules if we are really want to solve this. We can give our teens responsibility to their communities.We can give them good opportunities to think more and help their communities."

Life is a series of good and unfavorable things.No one can stop trying just because it has risk involved in it.When individuals endavor a task with lots of deligence some times they make it beyond axpected and some time fail.When people stand up to their life and give everythings they are more likely to become successful.
Successful people have the greed for success.They willput numerous efforts and try out different methods to make the things happen.
Once someone becomes successful they also go through undetermined pressure to keep their work and give something extra to the community.Brad Pitti is a successful filmstar but he just can not stop at action movies such as ""Ocean Eleven"" he felt the need to show his art and success by proving his performance in ""Babble""(A kind of offshore  and intense film).
Though people are successful they try to jump further high and take risk and become more successful.Astronauts have reached on moon but they di not stop there they invented the satelites which can remain in the vicinity and be usefull for ages.
""Newton"" successfully established his first law but he continued his contribution and work to the community by establishing two more laws of totally different phenomenons.
Success is an addiction.In stock excahnge market people often engaged in different short term and long term baits and investments.Once they are successful in one bait they explore the market more and tempted to take more risk for more monetary benifits.
Also when you get success to tend to think more positive about youself and try out many more things which would prove beneficial.Risk is imporatnt part of every task.Evene if we start walking on road there is a risk of accident but world simply doesnt stop because life has risk of death.

176,0,"This statement has been greatly discussed in many didactic environments  for the simple reason that some consider the theoretical knowledge to be more important than the practical one and some consider the opposite.
I was lucky to have personally attended schools that agreed and disagreed with the statement since I attended an italian high school ( that relies mostly on ideas and concepts) and a canadian high school ( that focuses more on real facts that occured).
This is why foreigners find that italians know how to talk about a certain topic but they do not know how to actually solve (or i should say)  ""fix"" it. My uncle, an engineer who lives in Canada, once attended a conference here in Italy and he noticed how Italians honestly might know more about the theory ( in this case physics or maths) but need help from the more ""hands-on"" engineers from abroad who considered real cases during their education giving them a higher experience.
In my opinion learning about facts is definately more enjoyable and gains a higher interests within the students.It also gives you a better insight of today's world situation. 
The reason why we study History is because we ought to learn about events that occured in the past and to prevent the same mistakes or find a better solution.
Once I came back from my school year abroad it wasn't easy for me to get used to the old and stricter method. I tried to make my teacher understand and realize how a fact that occured implicitely has the concept in it.
Experience also plays a key role and to discuss about real facts certainly helps a lot. As once Oscar Wilde said ""Experience is the name we give to our mistakes"" .
This is why I believe that it is definately important to learn and understand ideas and concepts but the next fundamental step would be to consider a real fact that concerns it.
Italy has a very ancient background on its shoulders and it would be very hard to change its attitude or point of view."
3052,0,"There are many impressive advertisements in every countries to make their products look nice.However, I sometimes dissapoint its value when I buy ,because it is really different from they are.That's the method of atracting people to buy their goods and that's the only way that people know about the products.
	In my oppinion, it is important to make goods look nice for sellers because they have to sell products as much as possible because they spend a lot of money for the advertisements.For example, one company which sells goods cheaper than othere companies in Japan.They don't use big advertisements.Their goods are worth of the price but it's not atractive at all.For getting customers and improving their quality, it is important to have a advertisements.competition is good for customers,too.
	It is difficult to know about products without any advertisements because that's the only way to let people get across.It has to be catchy and impressive.If there are same kind of products at the same time, it's difficult to decide which one to buy.I think it is also an important ability to show the products nice for the companies.
	In conclusion, for these reasons that I mentioned ,I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.It's neccesary for the modern society's competition."

We see many people regretting about their past, for they lived in a routine and never took the chances they had just because they thought it was risky. It is well known that the richest man in my country was broke and homeless in his childhood. To me, taking risks is the main gate to success and happiness in your life, since that may be only chance for you to make your future dreams come true and not to regret in your prospective life.

In three months, I will receive my diploma and become a physician. The tendency of medical graduates is to specilize on a clinical branch and practice privately. I have not applied for the graduation exam yet and I will not, instead I am applying for a research scholarship in Japan and planning to complete a doctoral course there. it is obvious that it will be more challenging and time consuming, but I think that once I receive a degree in Japan, a door to study abroad academically will be open. But the door may permenantly be closed; too. I am acting in an unorthodox way; but as Robert Frost says: ""I took the one less travelled by, and that made the difference.""

""If only I had the chance..."", ""I wish I could use this chance..."" are the words I never intend to use and in my opinion, regret is the worst feeling one can has in his life. Time passes by and there is no chance to reverse it. The only thing that one can do is to anchor to that chance and go for it no matter how risky the situation is, so that he will not find himself in a routine life and he will never experience the feeling of regret. Not to feel regret in any of the steps of your life is actually what I perceive from the word ""peacefulness"".

In summary, I can say that taking risks is the main taste of life that leads to success and the source of happiness hides in a mind that has no idea of regrets about the past."
1948,0,"In our society, we can see that many successful people who are succeed with the coming of new things. There is one statement saying that successful people try new things and they take risks rather than just doing what they already know how to do well. I agree with this statement. My reasons are as follows.

Firstly, if one people wants to be successful, he must create new ideas and create new things in his research field. Creating new things means having risk at the same time. No one can predit what will happen next. We can see that the abundant knowleadge we learned in university are ordinary and need to be combined to create something new. If one only do what he has known to do well, nothings new will come out. As one example, we all know how to use internet to communicate, now we can chatting through PC camera and some chatting software, but before, we only could use internet to communicate through forum which was boring. The people who invented the software and the hardware did know how to create new things rather than did what he had know how to do. The software might be at risk of letting out personal information at first but it was resolve finally. Then, the software benefits many people using internet to chat.

Secondly, ordinary things have no attraction to the public. People like to accept new ideas and something strange to people's everyday life. Successful people tend to make new things to enrich people's life and at the same time, they like to take the risk. If they just do what they have known to do well like most of the ordinary people, they can not succeed. In history, there were many scientists who had denoted their lives to some scientific experiences. Their goals were to invent something new to our society and made them benefit for people.

What is more, the confidence of taking risk for something demonstrates one's ability which is better than ordinary people. Not many people want to take risk for something. So, that is why some scientists succeed. We should increace the confidence to take risks for new things in order to create new things for our society.

So in all, in my opinion, successful people will succeed when they try something new but not to do what they had known to do well. If one wants to succeed, the ability and braviation of trying new things and taking risk is necessary."

That is because society and trend always change. 
I'd like to bring an example of beepers and mobile phones in Japanese market.
The beeper has recently vanished after 40 years of history from its Japanese market. It used to be one of the most popular mobile goods untill mobile phone was commonly used. I remember when was in school, all of my friends had one and it was the main tool to communicate with each other. If you had a bisiness to deal with beepers - could be a manufacture, supplier of materials to manufactures or agencies to make deals with consumers - your business back then must have been successful and prosperous.
However, mobile phone became more and more popular since over 10 years ago and it has now overtaken the beepers. Nowadays almost everyone has one or even more than two, like one for private use and the other for business, and it's hard for many people to imagine a life without them. 
As being involved in the beeper business if you decided not to go into mobile phone business but stick to the beepers because you did not feel comfortable with trying new things and did not like to take risks, your business dealing with beepers must have gradually diminished and it was no longer successful.
In any category, as I meantioned above, trends constantly change and you can't stick to the same thing forever. To be successful, it is necessary to adopt new things to go with the latest trend and it always require some risks but it's, I think, unfortunately unavoidable in order to get success."
3402,0,"I think the best way to travel  is traveing alone. However, if I don't used to traveling places like language and culture, I need to go there with tour guide. Consequently, if I trip to somewhere at first, it is the best way to take tour guide's help. 
  When I was 6 years old, I travelde in Japan with my family. At that time, I was so young trip to Japan alone and I could't speak Japan at all. Abobe all, I couldn't be knowing Japanese culture. After all, I need my parent as a tour guide. They live in Japan for 7 years and speak Japanese very well like Japanese. At that time, if I know Japanese a little and their culture, I can enough travel in Japan alone. If someone don't  know traveing palce's culture and their languages, they will lose their way and sometimes they make mistakes like food habit. In india, they can't eat cow's meat for realigious belief and they don't use sticks when they eat food, they use only their hand.
  Of course, if we know traveling palces's culture and language,  we can travel alone. There are some reasons to travel alone except tour guide. At first, we can travel freeway. If we travel some places with tour guide, they will always interuppt us until we traveld to finish. Second, we can learn their culture and their language for myself. If we have a few knowledges about thier culture and speak their language a little, we can grow up language skills and our knowledges about othter culture. And then, we can explain our thinking to friends, family and relatives, so we will feel achivements. 
  I think it is the best way to trip traveling palces alone if we have enough knowledge about their culture and speak their language. We can get many things form traveling in strange palces."
6426,0,"When economy grows in a country, more people are able to purchase their own private cars. In this regard, more people may have cars in twenty years in Thailand. 
As far as Bangkok is concerned, however, I disagree that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. Currently, too many cars are on road with less proper regulations and these cars have caused environmental and health problems. Since these problems are geting more serious, the civil society,  which may grow more in forthcoming decades in Thailand,  urges the Thai Government to restrict the number of cars in Bangkok and the Government has started to take actions as follows.
First, the Thai Government has been aware of necessity of more public transportationss due to the current trafic situation in Bangkok. In the morning and evening, people commuting by cars including their privaite vehicles and buses have to spend a lot of time; this is really wast of time for individuals and the country's development. If people can use more varieties of trains with an affordable price and convenient manner, they will of course prefer using them. In this sence, it is important for the Government to continue to develop the underground train and sky-train system not only in Bangkok but also its suverbs. According to the plan of the Bangkok Metropolitan Authority, I am sure that a lot more lines of these trains will be constructed in twenty years.
Second, alike Singapre and other countries, the Government will enforce a proactive regulation for reducing the number of private cars in Bangkok. For example, specific rush hours in morning and evening, a car should have 4 passengers including a driver. Besides, when Bangkok has become more developed, the price of its real estate will increase. Due to it, the parking lots will have to charge much more than now. This has been seen already in a big city like Tokyo, where people avoid using their car for shopping since the parking fee is sometimes more expensive than their purchase at the shopping center."
1056,0,"I agree with the statement "" Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well"".

The statement above is considered to be statisticly true due to the fact that those successful people have a back-up plan that they are currently using which  is the things they are already doing. The saying "" If it ain't broke don't fix it"" is false for the business world.
If those sucessful people keep clinging to what they already have eventuallly somebody else will take thier idea and evolve it or take it to another level, thus leaving those successful people no choice but to take risks and try new ideas.

If successful people try new ideas that help them and further increase thier profit and help them build a better reputation then they will gladly take that idea. If they try something new and hope that it becomes successful then the faith that they put in thier new idea(ex. project, product, or any other thing) will either strengthen or weaken depending on the outcome of the new idea.

In life it's either eat or be eaten. The same rule applies to the business world. If you have a plan that you might think will work or will not work then you should take a chance and not any chance but a calculated chance that gives you hope of letting your plan work or flourish. Many people try to invent new gizmo's or even update old ideas, but they fail in doing so becuase they lack the financial aid or even the help from people, that is why only successful people take chances and try new ideas so that their success continues and that thier business continues to grow."
12064,0,"I believe that people do enjoy life more when they are young than when they age. Life is a gift and needs to be enjoyed to the maximum. 

Consider a young kid about 15-20 years of age, for him life has just begun. He is opened out to a world where there is joy and peace, sorrow and grief both at a time. For this young lad, almost everything he does is his first time at it and will be excited no matter what. On the contrary people aging lets us say about 35-50 years have already seen all that the young kid has seen and gone through. For the old lifes just passing by.

Younger children often are more energetic and enthusiastic and yet more vibrant in doing something mostly if it is for the first time. While for the elderly, they have too many responsibilities and burdens on their shoulders that they do not seem to enjoy. Thats why they take time off from work for a vacation to relax, just to get back and start all over again. In a way even if the old want to enjoy they still are held back and are circumscribed in their ways.

I believe the main reason why the young enjoy life more is that they do not have any burdens at their tender age. All they have to take care is their grades and studies. The rest all are taken care of from their parents. The old even when they retire think of their grandchildren and their education.

The beauty in life as i think of it is to live each day as a gift as this is mostly found in the young."

Foe example I like go out with my girl friend,with her I go in moutain and to sea side this is very amazing. I have also a passion for computers. For these machinaries  upkeep is a lot of important because a computer is composed by a lot of parts mother board,cpu and other. For Young people is very easy todo every thingh but old people are in difficulty, this is vary sad. A particular way to help old people is, go out with they. With this process two catogories of people are very happy,thisis very good. In this way also old people have fun and they are happy. 
But in same cases this is not possible and the situation become very sad. Nevertheles  instead in some cases old people are more happier than young people. I think that all categories ofpeopel are happy in different way becasue there are a  lot of types of age.  Nowadays to old people there are some activitys to create fun. Another important thing is that old people are very useful because they have a historycal memory and they can tell to children a lot of strories. Some old people go in schools to tell their experiences thisis very important to the community.

10521,0,"I don't completely agree with this statement: In my opinion both the understanding of ideas and concepts and the learing of facts are important to the cultural growth of a student. As a matter of fact, many times, ideas and concepts are consequences of facts happened in that period. Consequently, students can understand ideas better if they know in what environment these concepts were born: the facts can describe the context in which those ideas grew up. Following this view, we have to know the importance of the history studies: only throught the knowledge of our past we can completely understand ideas and concepts that grew up in those periods. For example, only if we undestand what were the economic problems during the 17th-18th Century we can fully comprehend the Industrial Revolution and its new ideas of mass production. 
But the opposite can also be true: some new ideas can change the behaviour of people, so resulting in new events in the human history. For example, some new ideas in the world of the Physic were followed by the Atomic Bomb and by its use during the World War II. In the same way we could mentione the new researches in the genetic field: surely these new ideas will change the world of tomorrow and will give the true prospective throught which read the future facts. 
In these terms, it is not more important for students to understand ideas and concepts that it it for them to learn facts. What is really important is to undestand that you cannot fully comprehend a concept without knowing the context in which this new idea was born."
8886,0,"Some people say that the youngsters don't have any interests in helping their communities any more but grabbing their own
ambitions, while others argue that the young of these days are more motivated to give help for their communities. Considering the growing passions of young valenteers, however, I strongly desagree with the statement written above.     

     For the first, there are social advantages which encourage the youngsters to help their communities. In specific, since participating in local communities can provide the youngs with some neccesary and useful experiences from real world, such as skills needed  for processing certain job, taking part in local activities doesn't mean only doing bothering tasks for the young valenteers any more. For instance, I once took part in local festival as an staff. As there are so many foreigners who visited in my community, all I should do was rushing here and there, giving free interpretation. Even though it was tough and did't provide me any money, I could more valuable things through that event, Improvement in my English interpretation, and social skills.

   On top of that, the youngsters nowadays are tend to dedicate themselves for what they put their values on. According to the Department of Labor of Korea, in 2005, more than 60% of colleage students have experiences of valenteering in their local needs. What is more, they stated that what they wanted to acquire through their activities was not money but their self improvement. This case clearly represent the fact that they are now put their values on not only material things but also the mental things.

     There is  an old Korean saying goes like this; Helping neighbors is as valuable as helping one's own siblings. This represent the idea that  giving one's hand for others need is a kind of qualification to be an well rounded person. Thus, as long as the importance of cooporations such as giving one's hand for their comunities exist, the active participation of youngsters will never be limited."
2288,0,"Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.I can only support this statement, because one  will never be more successfull than others, if one does not try out new thinks. And for trying out something new one has to take the risk to fail, or to get hurt.
This implies the fact, that successful people have to be very confident. Confidence means in this case to be able to keep your head up and go on, eventhough something did not work. Because this is what happes all the time when you risk something, sometimes it might work, sometimes you will fail.
Of course being successful does not only mean  having a big job career, one can be successful in sports, school, family, organizing life ect.
But in everything you want to succeed you have to be open for new things.If you always walk the same path like the others you will never 
step out off the mass.But walking new paths asks for alot of courage, which people can get when they get older and more experienced.
So finaly I want to say everybody has the chance to be successful, they just have to be willing to take the risk."

8195,0,"I totally agree with this statement. People who are successful are people who do not hesitate to take risks in order to achieve their goals. It does not mean that they are affraid of nothing. But they estimate the risks and then decide to take it or not. There are some good examples that we can give to explain that point of view:

In business, we know that people who measure risks and take some will be successful businessmen. The director of the Virgin Company Richard Brandson is someone who did took risks to succeed in creating such a huge and modern company. After selling CD, DVD, travelling tickets, mobile phones, and sodas, he is now selling tickets for a trip in a spaceship. This guy also tried already 3 times to travel around the globe in his Virgin balloon.

In sports, we all know that people who take big risks will be the best: in Formula one for example, the drivers are risking their life to win a tournament. In football, a player like Zidane is successful because he does not hesitate to take risks in front of other really good players. And it is the same in all sports.

And when we think about arts, we can say that the major artists of our century are the one who took risks to do new things. Picasso for example knew really well how to paint realistics pictures but he decided after a certain period of time to change for a new way of painting. And Moliere was hated by the public of his own time because he created a new kind of theatre. He took also a big risk. 

In conclusion we can say that not taking risks does not help being successful. What is important is too measure the risk we take and assume the results it will give."
6406,0,"It all dependswath enjoy life means for people, live or  live in excess, as much the better. I belive that young people enjoy life if that is go to parks or beaches and practice extreme and dificult sports. Young people can stay late at night, drinking or dancing but the also can wake up early in the morning and go to work. They don't have limits in how much risk and danger they take. Much young people receive economic support from their parents and that give them more time to enjoy. Parents always try to give their kids the life style they never enjoy.  The society and the process of evolution in technology give also an advance to joung people for experience new ways of enjoy life. Young people don't focus to much in the future,they just want life and enjoy the present. 
	In the other hand is the old people who is feeling the weight of life in their body. Even if they take care well of their body,older people can't practice sports or social life from long periods of time. Somentimes  thats not really important because everything in excess is bad.Older people see life from other pont of view. They do the same than joung people but not in the same intensity. They discover the beauty of life and develop the quality of look for the detail. The detail give you the hability to recognize when someone or somenthing is special. seeing the quality versus quantity when you give or receive is an art that need to be cultivate.The precious reality in this situation is that everyone is going to experience at some point of their life both sides of the human nature. I am a 37 years old male with a latin tradition. I love my LORD  JESUS  and  believe that at this point of my life, I stay with the old people. I prefer quality versus quantity."
716,0,"In my opinion there's something true in this statement but it's not quite accurate. 
Succesful people are regared to be very rich, famous and wealthy. So if an famous actor decided to take the risk of quitting the movie buisness and to start a whole new career (for example as professional football player) he wouldn't be taking any risk at all. If he failed he would have enough money to survive this episode of ""new life finding""  and the whole world would report about his attempt to change his job. So everybody would know about his ""risky"" plan which isn't risky at all in fact because he's got nothing to lose.
Inspite of this unsuccessful people would have huge problems if they tried to change their job because they wouldn't have any savings to life from if they didn't succeed. Furthermore nobody would know about this risky attempt because no newspaper or TV station would be interested in this particular change.
I think the media gives us the impression that successful people are trying new things more often than the common people because we are directly confronted with their new ideas.
Let's give an example: David Beckham (a famous soccer player from Great Britain) changed his haircut every few months and the whole world was impressed by his new style and courage to do so. At the same time I dyed my hairy every week to another beautiful color but nobody execept my worried mum was interested in this.
Fame and success make it possible to inform (even without the intention to do so) the huge mass about the new things certain people are trying.
Another exemple: When Arnold Schwarzenegger decieded to start a political career every newspaper reported about this sensational event but when I won the election to the new head of the sports club not even the local newspaper was interested in this.
To summarize: Successful people aren't taking more risks or trying new things than the normal human being is, the only difference is that the media reports about them."
3363,0,"In different countries, we have different types of education, the question that must be highlighted is which kind of education ids the best or the most efficient. In my opinion, to have broad knowledge of many subjects is better. For that, I shall use how it affects social behavior and then how it is a simpler way for teenagers to get to know which job they really want to do.

Firstly, acquiring a wide range of knowledges allows one to interact more easily in one's society. By having at the same time notions of maths, of geography, history or arts for examples allow communication to be wider. There are more subjects to discuss about; in other terms having more knowledges is possessing a larger culture.  I think that knowing facts about history, geography, philosophy, economics are important because they concern the humanhood and more specifically our daily life, so they are benficial to us, how would we know where are countries when mentionned at the television for example. The perfect image of this type of person who knows a bit  of everything is Sherlock Holmes who although being specialised in crimes, due to his occupation, we learn that he knows a variety of things : chemistry, self-defense are such examples. Throughout the different stories, we can see his easyness to get in a conversation with anyone on anything.

Secondly, as a student I know that choosing a future job and thus selecting the corresponding courses is very difficult. As a fact, postponing such decisions are a way to be fully happy and totally aware of their meaning and consequences once the time has comed. Moreover, continuing or beginning academic subjects is important because as time passes you can progressively decide which you prefer and therefore making the right choice at the right time. However, making a professional choice does not imply letting all the other knowledges down, in the contrary one can get specialized once he is beginning to work but by no means forget what he has learnde beside.


To sum up, I would say that it is necessary possessing a wide range of knowledges as it allows to be more social, and it helps to our comprehension of our environment. It helps also on the choice of the job one has to make has it gives him time to appreciate and to make the best decision for him."
2456,0,"I'm not sure about the real meaning of the word succesfull near the word people.So,in order to try to answer to the question, I can try to look to my experience.
Throughout new things and take risk you can obtain more beneficts but ,in the same way,you can easily go to the bankrupty.However,actually,if you search the success you must try new ways as well as our parents do.The standardization and the globalization made all of us at the same level and so for emerge you will find many problems because there will be always anyone that make your job better.
In the other hand I think that if you know well your job and you work with attention and expecially with passion you will recognize by others that ,for example,will prefer spend more money with a quality or traditional product instead of pay the multinational that producu your product at  a lower price.We can think to the ""Made in Italy"" in opposite to ""Made in China"".Why the people continued to buy product with a higher price? 
In my opinion you will can be a succesfull person both trying new things and doing well what you already know. The main feature that you should have is the passion for your job. If you had this capacity you will be able to continuing to do what you already know how to do and to try new ways or new things with less risk. In that way you will be a succesfull person. 
The reality is that you are a succesfull person when you feel so."
10932,0,"Understanding is the basis of learning. Manipulated knowledges forms the ideas and consepts. Ideas and consepts are reasons of the facts. Indeed learning facts without understanding theory behind them is useless. In addition learned ideas and concets are also  useless without relating with the facts. These two are connected to each other.

Ideas and consepts are important on learning but without relating with real facts, teaching system constructs useless brains. Students sure need to understant the main theories behind the real events. Understanding main ideas give the ability of making  brain storms and ability to find  relations between knowledges. According to the student  psyhcology, when the ideas do not related with real examples, knowledges hung up in the air. For  instanece, I were giving extra physics lectures to my neigbours little boy. He always ask me to give real examples for the subjects. It is neccesary to inform students about ideas and make relations by facts.

If consider the other option, teaching students the lectures based on facts. There should be many questions occur in their minds. Why, how, when...It is geting more and more difficult to answer all those questions by only informing them with facts. An instructor can not possibly teach about chemical lessons. Matter consist of atoms and atoms inhales electrons and protons. It is impossible to understant main scince theories with facts.

To sum up, education can not be established on only ideas, theoris and concepts. They should be related eith the real examples and facts. In addition no one can possibly teach or undestand  most subjects by facts."
4845,0,"Yes,it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than specialisze in one specific subject because of various reasons.

If a person has knowledge about a particular subject,it is good.But if he wants to refrain himself from foraying from other subjects he should make sure that he is very thorough with that subject.Because finally he should find a job on that basis only and more ver all the academic topics are interconnected so, it imperative to have knowledgein various fields.

The above option would be good only if he find a job.He should always keep in mind the different possibilities in hi carreer.He should ask himself ""what if i dont get a job in his desired field of study?""

For example I am a mechanical engineering student.as every one knows there is a scarcity of jobs for mechanical engineers.if i continue with the same field would be left unemployed.Here I need to have an alternate option.I have my alternate option as computer sciences .I started learning some computer subjects.Now even if i donot get a job in my field of study, i may have a chance of getting it in field of computers.This would not leave me unemployed.I personally feel that being employed is better than being unemployed.

This criteria not ony works for two fields of same backround, it also works for a technical background and an arts background.For example, an electrical engineer who doesnot have a job and whose hobby is singing ,can survive by giving some stage shows .Which would also be considered as an employment.

Moreover ,broader knowlege would not leave you speechless when you are in a group.because when agroup is discussing a topic and  
if you are silent ,you may feel embarassed with that.But if you are familiar with the topic you can also give your opinion on the topic.this is possible only if you donat confine yourself to a particular field

I conclude that having a broad knowledge is better than to specialize in one subject."

Older people cannot live in the world with a long period of time, so they try to enjoy life with their sons, daughters, wives, or husbands. They try to spend much more time on their families,besides spending time on working. It is because many of them are retired or work less than young people. Young people always spend their time on their works, without enjoying life with their families. So, older people have more spare time to enjoy life with their families.
Moreover, older people realized that they have so many things, which they want to do most. And they cannot do them when they were young. For example, they want to travel around the world. They have much money and so much time to travel around, which compares to young people. If you don't have enough or much money, how can you enjoy better life. Many people don't have much money because they need to buy a house for their life in the future, their saving accounts don't have enough money for them to enjoy life.
Older people have less things to care about. For example, older people, who is over fifty years old , do not need to care so much about their sons' or daughters' education, or their daily lives because they are mature enough to take care of themselves or supports their own live. Older people have much more freedom, so they can enjoy life without any worries. They have more opportunities for them to do other things with lots of freedom.
In the conclusion, young people have many limitations which cause them enjoy life less than older people."

  The world is progressing fast and making advancement in each and every field. The major advancements are in the field of science and technology. There has been continuous attempts to improve and develop newer and more cars. 
 Time is very precious for every individual.Suppose you have to attend a very important meeting and ypu plan to take a bus or a metro, if you are lucky you get the conveyance the moment you reach, but wat if you just missed the bus.Then, to your utter dissappointment you will have to wait for the next bus, which obviously means that you'll reach late at the meeting or will have to miss the meeting, if it happens that that day there all the buses n other conveyance are stopped. Either of it will put a bad impression on the other staff.Cars, though not the fastest but are most efficient and easy mode of travel if a person has to travel a short distance. 
Now about the long journey like the cross country journey, obviously its not very feasible to use a car for it.As it will amount to a large petrol consumption and will often be more expensive. But some people who are nature lover, and enjoy watching nature and greenary prefer using car. For long distance travel, the flight being cancelled and late can cause a delay and also various other inconvenience to the passengers.To cater to these needs of a person and most importantly to save time, the demands of the cars are increasing, and thus its number is increasing.

3595,0,"Taking risk and trying new things out rather than doing thing that have already proven to work has been the source of major inventions and accomplishments. I conlude that trying and taking risks are the most important  factors for people to be successful. 

In most areas there is a need to have a good education and knowledge base to get a job done and to be succesful in a certain filed. To run a business, for example, it is necessary to know everything aboout your product, the market and the customers and once you have gained the knowledge and experience and the products or services are streamlined and are successful in the market the business owner could try to just keep everything ""as is"" to run the business from that point on. 

The problem is that if the outside factors change the demand for the product might decline, competitors might have similar products, but lower production costs which all cause the business to decline. 

Thus, the business owner needs to constantly try out new things, do new investments, issue new products - take risks to ensure that his products are successful in the market. 

Trying out new things gives the one who does it the best experience and the best knowledgebase he could have; inside knowledge of what works and what doesn't work. Someone who only sticks with what he has learned already and wht he has been doing for years will never get the insights and cannto be successful in that specific area.
The same is true for taking risks: chances are always associated with risks which means, in conclusion, that only those who take risks are also able take chances. To start a new business, to travel to an unkonwn territory, to do scientific experiments always contain risks; but most of men's major accomplishments have been made by those people who started the new businesses and travelled to unkonwn territories. 

My conclusion is that people even need to take risks and try new things"
7110,0,"It is often believed that young people enjoy life more than old people, due to several reasons, which, in my opinion, are related to the availability of time and other physical and mental resources, such as enthusiasm. I believe that this view is, in some way, incomplete, although not entirely wrong. 
The incompleteness of the view, is given by the fact that old people are people with experience. This means that they can assess values to certain actions on the basis of their past experience. They know what to do in order to enjoy certain positive feelings, as well as they know what to avoid. This means that people, once they become old, have all the necessary resources in order to exploit their knowledge on themselves, and hence collect the fruits of their lives as young people. In addition, although some people believe that money does not make happiness, old people are more likely to have money to spend for themselves, making them enjoy life in more ways. This would imply that you start to enjoy life only at a certain age.
However, there is the opposite pont of view, which is the one of the statement. Young people, or at least most of them, do not have many things to worry about. It is up to their parents to control and administer the so called `dirty work`, whilst they are free to grow up. This shows that people, during the early stages of life, have plenty of time to dedicate to themselves, to the discovery of new things. If it is true that old people know what things they like and what they don`t, with the advantage of not having to experiment anymore, it is also true that youngsters have the possibility of going through the process of discovering, which is probably the most interesting and fulfilling of all, as it gives you the opportunity of knowing new things and experiencing new feelings, which were previously unknown. For example, people usually remember their first kiss, rather than their last.
In conclusion, I would say that life can be enjoyed at every stage, when you are young and when you are old, although in different ways. The first period of life should be dedicated to discover what you like and enjoy, whilst the last should be dedicated to the exploitation of such discoveries."
364,0,"Today's youth is a dynamic one,everything is instantaneous and at a rapid pace.As much as I agree with the amount of work load the people of today's generation have,I still feel that the young people nowadays are not doing enough for the betterment of their community.
        People especially young people complain about the problems faced by them in their cities such as traffic,corruption,crimes etc.But rarely is there a person among them who is ready to jump into the system and take steps in solving the problems.In my opinion if you do not have the capability to stand up and take the matter into your own hands,you should quit whining and live with what you have.
       The youth nowadays does not understantd its responsibility towards its community.They maintain a very laid back attitude, caring slightly about the problems faced by the community.It is the young people who should step up and take control of a problematic situation, as it is they who are brimming with energy,have fresh
ideas and will be responsible for the future of their community.For e.g. in a country like India where the average age of a political leader is not less than sixty years corruption is rampant but none of the youngsters feel the need to join politics and improve the condition,they feel that joining politics would mean a waste of their academic degree.
        For today's youth helping the community is a very unimportant thing, for them their personal success comes first.They are very self-centered and selfish and would rarely waste their time and energy on a project for the betterment of the community.They seek personal advantage first hand.
        Seldom after a natural disaster or calamity do we see the young people helping the affected people.It is always the older people helping themselves or the young school going children collecting funds.In such conditions it is the youth of the community that should step up and bring back the much needed stability.Whereas instead of helping in disturbed conditions today's youth does not bat an eyelid about it.They feel it is a waste of their precious time.
        An ideal example of a responsible youth would be Bhagat Singh a revolutionary of India's freedom struggle who fought and even sacrificed his life for the freedom of his nation.
        I think that today's youth should follow in the steps of the great Bhagat Singh and realise their duties towards their community,and also take whatever steps necessary in improving their community."
5687,0,"I agree with that statement because learning facts are based on understanding ideas. Students cannot learn new facts without knowing where they came from or what corroberates them.
for some people, memorizing a new fact is enough. It might not be that important to them to understand it or study it. but i disagree with that. there has to be a base for everything someone learns or it wont be concidered learning.
My favourite subject has always been Math because, unlike subjects like History and Literature, its all based on logic. everything has an explanation and acknowledging that explanation leads to acknowledging a new fact. When students understand ideas, they become more productive, and more accomplished, because grasping and analizing ideas leads to creativety which leads to creation. 
Students have differents learning skills, some learn by memorizing conlusions, and some cant memorize without an knowing how they reached to the those conclusions.
Understanding ideas is more difficult that learning facts. a fact can be learned by reading a book or a biography, an idea has to be studied to be learned, which oblidges more thinking.
As a result, one who studies new concepts provide more in the community in the future, because what  is his or her mind are not just fixed facts, they are ways of thinking.
If someone thinks about the technology that is enhancing everyday and the growth of our economies, it will be clear that it is the cause of knowledge, knowledge that is not only obtained by memorizing facts but by creative minds.
There is more to improvement than learning facts. and when i say improvement i mean in yourself. when you want to imoprove youself you need to understand what you learn to implicate it. Thats how the process of teaching works as well. Teachers could have just given out books and told students to read them at home and get tested on them the next day. Wouldnt that have been easier if the point wasn't to make students understand what they're taking in school?"
4204,0,"I agree with this statement because sometimes when we watch tv we see news which is about people helping their comunities such as cleaning roads or advertising, but most of those people who helps comunity we see is old people. Why young people do not give enough time to helping their communities are because young people think its the old people's job or they do not care about their comunities.  Even though They do not help their comunities, some of them complain to their comunities. I think its just wrong because if they have something to complain to their comunities they should go and complain it and work the problem out with the other comunitiy workers. Thats the best way to get worked out the problem. However there are heaps of young people who do not care about their comunities. They don't even know who is the leader of their comunitiy or what their comunity working for people, if they know that who cleans roads or park, they would not make a mess on the road. As we can see, usually the messes on the road were made by young people that means they don't clean their road and let the other people to clean them."
6615,0,"I agree with the following statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.As we go on trying the new things it will be very usefull for the person to gain experince and also he can be able to solve the problems on his own with out taking the help of others,he can even face the risks so that he will be used to it and find easy to do well.

     As there is a saying that try and try untill u succeede and success is the stepping stone this is said because by tring new things only the man can prove him self as the successfull person he must also be confident of what he is doing.If we do the things as we know how to do it,it will not cost anything that is we cannot gain knowledege by it.We gain lot of knowledege by trying the new things and also we can earn lot of money by inventing or by making new things in the market that is as we take example as the software company there we need to do the things which are risky ones and which are the new ones.Risks must be taken by the people by doing any kind of work because if we solve the risks we can get the expirence and as well as we be the successfull man among the others.some people create many new things by their own ideas by taking lot of risks those type of people will be successfull.

   
     Hence i conclude this passage by saying that every person must try new things,take risks and also solve them by their own so,that he may be the successfull man.successfull man will always be in good position in what evre he do.so,i say that successfull people should try new things and take risks rather than doing what he already know."
1007,0,"Today, we usually heard that young people are not interesting in helping their communities. I think that young people have a different vision of that. They help their communities, but in a different way than ten years ago. 

First, the structure of a family has changed. There are more divorces, parents and children can live kilometers far away from each other etc. I think this could explain why young people feel less concerned about old people for example. But we can see some experiences in France to reduce the gap between old persons and children. Some schools have organised meeting, every week, where each child has a grandfather or a grandmother for the meeting. They play and make activities together. It is an interesting experience for children because lots of them have lost their grand parents or live far away from them. Moreover, they learn to care for old people.

In addition,  youg people have different behaviours because they have different educations. If the parents teach their children to help other people, I think they would follow this lesson later.  If they see parents helping a neighbour or someome of the family for example.

Another point is that the current society and parents ask a lot from young people. There is a lot of competition between parents because they want to show that their children are ""better"" than others in school, sport, music, etc.  This mean that children have lots of activites during the week and the week end so they have less time to spend for their communities.

Finally, I think that young people help their communities but they could give more time for it. Parents have to teach children that family and community are important and that they have to take care of each other."
1216,0,"WORLD OF ADVERTISMENT
	In the competitive environment of business every company tries to prove that it is better than another. One way to give such an impression is ""advertisement"". One aspect of this advertising issue is the conservation of honesty. Do the companies prefer their product to be presented in a way better than they really are? Unfortunately, yes they do. This concept will be analysed based on the following arguments: true aim of giving advertisements, when to give advertisements, comparison of the product we see and we buy.
	To begin with, it should be clear that, companies` intention in giving advertisements is to make their products sold. That is why they give money to advertisement makers, hoping that after this campaign there will be a dramatic increase in the profit of the company. Moreover, some companies prefer to give advertisements before a new product is out for sale. Due to the fact that no one has ever seen it, they can manuplate the appearance of the product such that it will look perfectly and be more prone to be bought.
	Secondly, a company might plan giving advertisements on products which have a lower selling rate recently. For instance, if a shampoo is not selling enough, the company agrees with a very well known artist or popstar for showing up in an ad and saying ""I am also using this shampoo, if you want to have as beautiful hair as mine you should also use this."" Actually, most people are aware that she is not using that shampoo. Nevertheless, they have a tendency and temptation to buy it. 
	Thirdly, apart from the fake suggestions and manuplations done on the picture with the computer, what is shown in the advertisements is the first appearance of the product, not what we buy from the market. There are several steps during transportation and storage where the product might be ruined. On the other hand, if they show us the picture of the product prr to being sold in the market, most probably people will not buy it. 
	As a conclusion, being trustwothy in giving advertisements is not a required behaviour in the area of business. People show their products in such a way that they look better than they really are due to aforementioned reasons such as: why actually they are giving advertisements, at certain time points advertisements are necessary and the product we buy is apparently distinct from the one we see. Eventually, these ideas support the hypothesis that advetisements make these products seem better than they really are."
1225,0,"Academic education has always been a debated issue because it deals with lots of purposes. One main point that is being more and more discussed is if it is better to acquire knowledge in many academic subjects or to specialize in a specific subject. We will see that even if a specialized academic curriculum can be rewarded, having knowledge of many subjects can help to be open-minded and can be useful in daily life and society.

First, avoiding specialization at school or at university permits to develop curiosity and to have an opened mind. Indeed, could you imagine what would be the consequence of only teaching biology to a ten-year-old child ? He would only focuse all his life on that subject. I believe that is the same for academic subjects. We must learn a lot from others subjects that the one we are going to work on all life. Having classes of history or economics can help you to remain interested in different subjects.

Moreover, the more the knowledge is diverse the more it is easy to face real situation. Only learning at university does not always help to know how to behave in specific situations. By attending to a diverse range of courses, this lead to a faster adaptation and understanding of the environment. For instance, a manager should have learnt different aspects of the economic business. If he only focuses on acconting, he will not be able to understand the Marketing team with which he will have to work.

However, it is necessary at a time to be specialized in one subject. To take the example of a plummer, he needs to be sure of  he is doing to to work. If we didn't have to specialized, everybody should know how to produce a pen or how to repair a car. 

Though I fully agree that sometimes it is relevant to specialize in a specific subject, I still believe that it is necessary to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because it permits to be curious and open-minded, to know how to behave in new environment and in daily life."
11083,0,"The foremost business philosopher in America Jim Rohn said, ""To survive in the twentieth century you have to know more than one skill."" Today, life is changing at a very high pace and more than ever before.  The computer age which revolutianized every possible aspect in the world has gotten us to what we call the age of knowledge where to specialize in one specific subject is not enough in order to fulfill one's self.  Therefore it is better and imperative that one gets specialized in more than one domain for economic reasons and personal reasons.

	Everyone wants to lead comfortable lives and have a safe future.  Most of us want to be rich.  To do so, nobody is going to be specialized in only one field because now, and more than ever, all fields are related to another.  For instance, let's take real estate.  An investor who wants to invest in real estate has to have an education in business, law, finance, banking, and even construction.  If this investor is only familiar in business, how can he know about taxation policies, or about which kind of construction material to choose from?  Therefore, a knowledge in more than one subject can prove a valuable asset when it comes to increasing wealth.

	To seek knowledge is everyone's personal ambition.  The process is tough and lifelong.  It requires a thirst for learning and a hunger to seek the many truths which our world stores.  To have knowledge in a lot of subjects is a virtue in society.  It gives reputation and instant recognition.  Take a company that wants to hire a new employee and  that has the possibility of choosing two candidates:  a person having a business degree who has worked only in one kind of firm all his life, and another holding the same degree who has worked in many differenet trends of business.  The company should choose the latter since he's been exposed to the world more than the other candidate.  Also, having an idea of a lot of subjects can be self satisfying since no one can laugh at the person or try to trick him.  The world is filled with cons and crook men.  If you're limited to only one type of education, the chances of you being cheated are very high.  Therefore having a broad knowledge in many domains can be rewarding on a personal basis.

	To sum up, being involved in more than one subject is much better than being only involved in one for many reasons  such as economic reasons and personal reasons.  Today the world obliges us to invest our time in education since it will affect our living conditions.  Being more knowledgeable is also rewarding in that it gives a good image and reputation and can serve as a defence against cheating.  And the most important thing is to keep learning, keep living, loving, and leaving a legacy for others to follow."

It seems to me that Advertisment shows  the  product  much better than real picture of the things .People should check and find out the correct ways to purchase and market their things  in order to not to be in situaion where they feel they have been cheated ,Also the traders must be honest  when marketing and selling their goods ."

8640,0,"In this period of time advertisements have a very strong impuls and influence in people's lives.

First of all I have to say that I was born in this generation where the industry more or less cannot survive without advertisements.

From sharing experiences with my mother and reading magazines from the '' sixties'', even back then advertisements played a big role in selling products. I agree with the fact that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are because that's the best way to win customers.

Human beings of course, only want to see,touch,feel,smell ..etc. the best a product can offer with the senses God gave them.

Regardless of the fact that a lot of products have disadvantages, people are prone to be blinded by the beauty and the advantages of the product itself.

For instance, a simple product like '' soap '', has to fulfill its purpose.
As a young lady I want to have soap that smells good, looks good,
a kind of soap that smoothens or even whitens my skin.

It is proven and I have read a survey oh how many people read information on the package of the soap if this kind of soap is dermatologically tested or not. The low amount of customers that read this information stroke me.

All what people want is what gives them a good impression in any art of media. Newspapers, magazines, posters, TV and radio advertisements will try to do their best in this competitive world market. In order for a product to seem better,advertisement companies would do everything to attract people.

As I have mentioned there is great competition in the market. And I have learned during my highschool time of strategies advertisements take.For instance, if they want to attract young people the advertisement company will use a model who is popular, like a famous soccer player or a politician who wil of course try to impress and catch the eyes of the viewers by wearing '' NIKE SHOES"".  If one person buys those NIKE shoes, everybody else will. That|'s how we people are.

I am aware that advertisements are exagerated and sometimes full of lies but I cannot deny that I am a victim of this trend."
5752,0,"When facing the question of whether to grasp more than one specific subject,people always are divided into two group,one of which agrees to learn broad knowledge of many academic subjects,however,the other of which belives that we should concentrate on one specific subject.In my opinion,mastering broad knowledge is the better choice.My reasons are presented as follows.
    First,learning various knowledge is beneficial to an individual in modern society. Now we live in a changeable world,in which technology rapidly is developed.This change generates the changes of our life style.For example, computer has entered our normal life and we hardly work without it.But some years ago,people did not know what it was.If we just stay on one specific subject and fail to learn knowledge about computers,how can we live normally in this society.So,the current society situation requires us to grasp many useful knowlege of different subjects and keep to refreshing them.
    Second,people that own broad knowledges always look smart because they may be enlightened by another subject knowledge.Holding different knowledges can enhance the thinking ability and raise the ways in which people think and act.When a person encouters a big difficulty on a subject, he may obtain some inspiration one day through focusing on another subject that he/she conducts.
    Admittedly,focusing on one specific subject may cause someone to research more deeply than dispersing one's concentrations on various subjects.Of course,researchers should pay their attention on the specific subject.But ,rearchers still learn other subjects that are useful in their lives.
    In all,comparing the advantages and disadvantages between having broad knowledge of many academic subjects and just having one specific academic one,I support my idea that people should learn various subjects knowledges rather than own one."
10061,0,"Knowledge is something that people have to have in order to have any academic career. Whether or not it is for one subject, knowledge is vital in order to make people aware and ready to make any career developments. 

In my oppinion, I think that specialising in one certain area, would mean that people can focus on one subject only, and that would provide more time for people to spend improving that subject and therfore makes him an expert. 

However, it can be a dangerous way to head to, because there are some issues that needs to be thought of. For example, in the future people may think that the career path that they have chosen is not what they want to contniue doing, that would mean that they will have to start over again, and study everything from the start. This can be very frustrating and overwhelming because it would mean that they would have to put a 'pause' in their lives for the moment to try focus on other subjects. 

Having a variety of academic subjects gives a person a wider range of jobs and even a better qualification because it means that a person has studied more than one subject and is capable of handling responsibilities. 

In the end, every one should think of their lives and if studying more than one subject will mean that they will not be capable of handling many things at once then they should focus on one subject without regrets, but if I was to make a choice, I would prefer to have more than one academic subject to study because it would open more doors in the future and would make me feel proud of what I have achieved and I would have many job offers to chose from and I would  also benifit from that because I would choose the carrer that most suites me."
1870,0,"I completely agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. There are two main reasons for that: they give a perfect appearance of an object that is not always that beautiful, and they represent some products as being able to do things that are quite improbable. 

First of all, most advertisements work on the physical aspect of the product in the picture or commercial. This is intented to show a perfect physical aspect of the product, but this doesn't always reflect the reality. For example, when you watch a McDonald's commercial, they give the burgers a much prettier image than the one you will actually hold in your hand when you order it yourself. Another example would be makeup commercials, in which all products seem to have a magical effect, when in fact, the lighting and beautiful models boost their apparent efficiency. These representations are intended to make the consumer buy the product, but he or she will most probably be disappointed when trying it.

Second of all, most advertisements display their products as being able to do things that are quite improbable, or at least very difficult. One major example for this is car advertising on television, which may show the vehicle climbing cliffs, engaging on racing tracks, or going into wild nature without any problem. In each case, and for any vehicle advertised, the product is not only shown as being adapted for these actions, it is also presented as the better one. This is surely not possible for all of those cars, at least not with an everyday-life driver. 

Although some of the advertisements may represent products accurately, the marketing rules lead advertisers to make strong endeavors to represent the product as well as they can to attract the consumer, even if it is not the exact reality."
502,0,"I totally agree with the statement. Ads do ""make products seem much better that they really are"". That's the whole point, is it not? To entice customers, to lure them to buy something. To somehow convince the buying masses that life will be oh-so-much-better with such-and-such a product. To do that, advertisers and other assorted marketing types must make the product stand out from the plethora of goods out there in the market place. And what better way to do that than to try to convince Joe Q. Public that his life will be dramatically improved, in mysterious ways, if he buys widget A or gizmo B?

Two examples that come to mind in that regard are car ads and cosmetics. Most car ads (there are exceptions, of course) do not focus on fuel economy or the quality of the seat belts. That would be factual. That would also be boring. Instead those ads show the car in a variety of dramatic settings -- the desert, rugged mountains, a curvy sea-side road -- going at high speed, and generally doing all kinds of things that a sane, normal, suburban driver would never do. And at the end of the commercial, in tiny letters at the bottom of the screen, you get the standard disclaimer: ""Professional drivers on a closed course. Do not try this at home."" If that is not 'making the product seem much better' than it really is, I don' t know what would be. But it makes the car look cool, and that's the whole point.

The other, even more egregious example is provided by skin-cream ads. Specifically, those that claim, for instance, that one's skin will be ""62% smoother"" or ""43% brighter"" or somesuch nonsense. Of course, those ads never actually explain how one measures skin smoothness or brightness. Or what that ""smoother"" refers to. Smoother than sandpaper? Who knows. But using a number, and ideally featuring someone in a white coat, will give a serious, scentific aura to a product which would otherwise be yet another skin cream. Heck, if it makes my skin 62% smoother, it has got to be more than twice as good as the competing product that only claims a 30% improvement, right?"
3303,0,"I'm in agreement with this statement for three principal reasons.

Firstly, the cost of energy is continuing to go up and in twenty years will be much more expehensive than is today. That is becouse the petroleum is going to be finished in 50 years and the territories with a lot of oil are instable. In this situation there will be a lot of people who couldn't effort the oil and conseguently who won't buy the car.

Secondly, there is the phenomen of urbanization in which people leave the countryside for the cities. This phenomen that is has already happened in Europe and America is happening at this period in Africa e Asia. More people will live in the cities e fewer cars in use there will be. That is becouse the people who live in the cities couse traffic or couse public transport facilities have a less percentual of cars respect the people who live in the countryside.

And lastly, there is another problem  for who has got a car: when you finish to use it you have to park it! And in the big cities couse parking restrictions or lack of space it's often difficult to park it.  

For these three reasons, cost of energy, urbanization and problems of parking I belive that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today."
10075,0,"I do agree that most advertisements are some times misleading to the customers and the customers end up spending huge amount of money.

Although there are laws which will take in to consideration about the products which are misleading and in bad tastes, there are many products which are coming into the market.

for example in the  E commerce, the customers rely on the perticular supplier and some times the customer recieve an inferior quality product and it is time consuming for the customer to return back the product as he has to follow the procedures.

advertisements should have a proper information about a product for the layman to understand .  the advertisers should act according to the law and the customers should have a easy accessiblity to return back the product if such product is not how it is described in  the advertisement.

There should be  customer line for every product for the customer to explain how he feels about the product and whether there any  suggestions  on the product. In the third world countries customers endup in paying huge amount of money relying on the advertisement and they hardly have customer lines.

In my openion there should be proper information about the product  and the product should give information in cases where  the customer is not fully satisfied about the product and the consumer care line should be there wherein the customer can complains about the product to the specific authority.

Lack of customer care line and not having a check on the bad advertisers, the customer will be in loss. the laws should be strict and customer should be informed where to complain and whom to approach  to give a complaint.

there are so many products which are advertised but dosent give clear message, customer often get confused and mislead with the advertisements."
1168,0,"Understanding Ideas Versus Learning Facts

 
      Last week I attended a class in history, and the teacher began talking about the arab history and speaking what had happened during these ages reaching the twenteenth century. Then I had a Physics class and the teacher was explaining the lesson. But this time the teacher was trying to make us understand the concept and how things work. The next day I remembered all what we took in Physics but non in history. And that is why teachers nowadays tend to teach their students by making them understand the concept.

     Teaches believe due to previous experience, that the knowlege get stuck in the student's head by trying to make him understand the idea and not just telling him some facts. It is better this way since the student will be able to understand the idea first then  apply this concept from what he understood. But if he just learned the fact without understanding it he won't be able to apply what he studied, and thus it won't get stuck in his memory.

  In addition to that if the student understood the topic he might enjoy it and try to expess his idea and ever participate and that is what motivate him to know that concept and never forget it. Where as if you just told him to study certain fact he wouldn't be interested and might not focus on the subject, and thus he might not memorise it and then he will forget it. Since with repetiton and understanding the student will know the concept without even studying since the moment he understood the idea it got stuck in his memory. And that is what happened to me.
 
   So it is much better for student to understand the idea and the concept rather than learning facts which might look kind of booring to the student.And these days students  tend not to study and memorise but they rather understant, which will enable them to study it much easier."

Becouse of that, the teenage time means that 15 years to 35 years old peoples are having extra energy  build  in the human body's.Its a scientifically those are improving a extra activities.In the age of above 45 years of the peoples are doing works normally.They can not particullarly compare with the young peoples.At the age of time body nature are not supporting to those activities.Those musules are not supporting to the works.They are working differnt fields and do more works in the young life.At the oldage they can not do any thing.
In the young age those peoples are doing very well at any of the perticular fields.Those can have do work help of the bady nature.
So its depends on the defferent body nature."
12016,0,"It is generally said that when traveling somewhere we need a group led by a tour guide. Although a group or a tour guide would give some benefits, however, I definitly belive that the best way to travel is to do alone, because traveling with a group led by a guide is too costly and time consuming.

Above all, the cost of travel in a group and a tour guide supplied by tour companies is extremely expensive. I experienced that before traveling the Osaka In Japan, the tour company that I chose suggested different options, if I added the tour guide to my travel, the tour company required almost twice cost as another which did not include guide. Eventually I chose traveling alone and could buy presents for my family and friends with extra money while abroad.  Moreover, nowdays we have a lot of resources about the tour informatation such as books in the library and internet that do not require any cost. With those methods, we do not need to expensive guides anymore.

Second, within the schduled courses suggested by tour guide, people cannot enjoy the travel entirly. As each person has different tastes during the travel, naturally there are differences that members want to look at. For example, when I traveled over the Europe with my family using package program desined by tour company, I felt uncomfortable because I wanted to stay in Paris longer while others did not want. Unfortunately I could not make schecule changed, I should leave Paris in short times with unsatisfactory. 

In conclusions, I disagree with the statement that a group led by a tour guide gives tourists most beneficial method, for the reasons that I mentioned above. Traveling with a group or a guide contributes a lot of stressful cost and it is wasteful in time-wides."

Hopefully, there is many variety of people between those two catergories and social ranks can by climbed. A person may be successful during a period of his life and then for the rest of his life become non-successful. 
	Today, many people that can be called 'successful' have accomplished this by taking risks such as Donald Trumps that risks to loose its fortune everytime he finance a new project. Howerver more common people have archive their 'successfulness' by taking risk such as my neightbor that has come to the United State in order to get a better futur. Not only has he accomplished that, but by risking everything to come to the USA he has now became a successful buisness man. Other people have taken risk but hve accomplish nothing. That prooves that bieng successful is not about taking risk but also thinking wisely.
	For example, a mathmaticien might on day decide to quit math even if it is what he does best and to becom an artist. Maybe he will becom well know and will becom 'successful'. At the opposit a tumandous violon player might choose to stay with violon during its life and not change to the piano. The violonist will gain internal recognition weather if he decided to become a pianist, he might have ended up a a mediocre player. 
If people had chosen not do do what they did beast, what would the world be today? Bill Gates might have decided not to go in electronic and so, micosoft would not have existed. Maybe great poeple such as Monet, O Keef, Picasso would never have become artist. Ben Franclin might have been an merchand and Jhonny Depp an electician.
	However with 'If' you can redo the world. No one knows what would have happened if all those succeful peoplehad taken a risk and nver did what they do the best. 
Being successful is not about taking risk or not, it is about having goals, determination and fate. Without those qualites no on can ever become successful, for they will let go at any difficulties they encounter."
5264,0,"I would say I gree.  Because life is yours. and who can be make your life? Depends on having fun life or not is your choice. no one cant decided. and you cant say that if you had bad life in the young time and you will get a great life after getting order. a life make it your owan had and your actions. if older people saying that young people enjoying their life that them and comlain about that means they(older people) couldnt make their life fun. if they had been could, they didnt. they didnt have a guts and braive to do it. and , for those older people to enjoying life not too late. dump the jerousy to the young people, and get your own life.
   when old people were young maybe they had soo much fun to satisfy their soul. and if there were not all enjoying, means if you try something that you interented and you make mistake, you will be learn something from it. there is nothing worthless. so you can have a lots of fun and what ever if its good or bad, it helos you to grown up when you get older you will be a better life with tons of great eperiences.
   A life is short. to spending woth time and somethig that you really want to do, you shouldnt put them off. take a chance and make an action.  you shouldnt regrets.  So, I think that young perople can having fun life more than older people."
43,0,"Personally I strongly disagree with the idea that successful people try new things or are risky people. Mistakenly since the beginning of the century, it has been believed that the reasons for success of some people who had started large companies were that they had introduced new concepts doing something different, and had taken risks. On the other hand, I believe that the reason for success are hard work, motivation and imagination. 

First I think that hard work usually fosters success. For example athlets are clear examples. The more and the harder they train, the better results they get. It is clear that athlets that get first positions in swimming races are not just risk people. Furthermore in academics or labor enviroument, the continuous effort is a valued factor. For instance Novel prizes are awared for work along several years and not just for one isolated paper or idea. 

In the second place, imagination (and not just trying something new) is crucial for success (which is reaching a goal). Some people who we consider successful such as Thomas Edison, or Albet Einstain, were people with a huge imagination, and therefore they were able to introduce innovations or new theories. 

Finally, motivation is the main factor for success. Even if a person has the skill, the discipline and imagination, if s/he is not motivated nothing will show up. Motivation is the willingness or the reaons for  reaching a goal. For example several history acadamics explain that successfull people as athlets, business men, or scientist usually are inspired in a fact as solving a problem, illness, or to honor their parents, etc. 

Consequently agreeing that success in only related to people who are just risky or just try new things, will only capture a narrow view of sources success. Success depend on deeper and wider things that the two thing named in the prompt."
1204,0,"In my opinion, it won't be an exaggeration that young people do not spend time on their community. It is true that young people seldom do things for their community. The reason  is simple.  Young people have other things to do and; most of all, few young people have the sense of community.
	Seldom young people in my country are required to do anythings for their communities. They are often be told that they have to study hard. Their reposibility is to focus on their study and their school work is always on the top of priority. To their ""consederate"" parents, things like helping their communities is taken as an bother to their children. Even the task is as easy as cleaning the sidewalk around the community, parents will usually choose to finish by themselves rather than getting their chidren involved in. 
	On the other hand, few of young people nowadays have the sense of community. They even don't know who their neighbor are. How can it possible to ask those indifferent people to pick the garbage scattering in the house next to their house. They usually think that their will solve the problems in the community because it is adult's bussiness. They are seldom be educated to help others. They claim that they are too young to have opinion and  ability to making descions about their community.
	I don't think that it is all the young people's faults that they pay little attention to their community. Their parents should also be responsible to this situation. Our younger shoud be taught to be more earnest to their living environment instead of caring only about themslves."
6530,0,"Many people in the world try to enjoy their life.  However some people think older people can not enjoy life, but that is just a stereotype. Old people can enjoy their life with their friends and hobbies.

	Young people usually like sports that old people can not do. There are some hobbies that old people can do such as, knitting, watch movie, plant their own gardens.Forexample, I watched my grandfather's one of daily life. He likes to plant flowers. When he got up in the morning, he went to flowershop and looking for the special flower seeds.And when he back to home, he sprayed the water the flowers. Sometimes he likes to show his wonderful garden to his neighbour. He loves to do it.

	
	The second reason is not only young people have their friends. Forexample, my grandmother has lots of her friends.In last month, she traveled to Europe with her friends. She said it was the best travelling ever done before. She did lots of shopping, and saw many beautiful european buildings. However, she said ,the best part of the travelling was talking with her friends. When people get old, they still like to spend a time with their friends and enjoy the time with them.

	Forthose reasons, old people can enjoy thier life with their friends and hobbies. Especially my grandfather and grand mother, they really love their life. If someone says old people live their life just boring and nothing special, that is not true, they can live their life what they like to do and spend the time who they wants.If they find their hobbies and friends, they would live their life better than younger people."
6146,0,"I do agree with the statement that ""successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.
                 successful people usually come from many failures and risks and after overcoming all this situations they gain success. So those people have a clear idea about how to tackle or overcome  with risks and problems. The man or woman who is usually successful prefer gaining more success from more new things or the  things which he or she is unfamiliar with.
                 And in order to try new things they never hesitate, whereas, the man who is usually under a nonsuccess stage fear to try for new things.There are many examples which support the answer . For instance , in the consturction field people usually succeeded in the field of consturcting huge buildings, dams, towers and flyovers which is usually a risky factor at those days. because they have succeeded in there field they are trying for more new things like going for more huge or enormous  works which is also a bit kind of risky. Because the consturction field people know a lot about there works and failure which they will meet in achieving things they try to solve them in more logical manner or say in an planned order.
               Not only in consturction field,  we can go for other fields like the most happening scientists field where they try only for new things rather than going for the know ones. Scientists always think of inventing about new things.If they would have taught that they cant take risk in inventing anything which we had now then  we couldnt get many luxories and also  disease preventing medicines for many hazardous diseases which is usually harmful to humans.
            When we go for new things then only we get new things in our day to day life which are becoming part of our daily life now-a-days and also daily routines. Hence in this fast moving world ,successful people should try for new things and should  take the risks to become more  success, rather than sticking of only doing what they already know how to do well."
6957,0,"I agree with this idea because of 4 reasons on it. Color, sizes, words,  and the feeling of people.
     The first one is the color impression. In fact, I am eaasily faked by this strategy. For example, most advertisements, of course, have its specifis characteristics. but my brain always get in color. My composition of the brain is, at first, color, and then, the personality.  Even if the ability is bad, I often buy the product.
     The second one is sizes. In the bills, we can not know the size of the products. This sometimes happens in case that buying something big or large (refrigerator, car). On the internet shopping, it is cheaper than usual shopping, however, this kind of shock can be easily occured. 
     The third one is words. Words makes our heart dramatically change. Take an example. The cloth is 100 left in vintage shop. 50 clothes sell 1 or 2 for a day. The owner is confused. One day, he made a poster that written : The clothes are left only 50!! 
This made meaningful effect that the products are sold out  for only 1day. Like this instance, words are very significant in the advertisement activities.
     The last one is feeling of people (personality). On the TV commercial,  various famous person advertise many products. In fact, the profits can become high and low by the person who is acting the CM."
5999,0,"The difference between young people and old people is that older people have already done what young people are out looking for to do. This does not mean that every older person has done it or that every young person is out to do it, it just means that people are different at different ages.	
	Young people for example teenagers are mostly going to high school and getting ready to go to college. The reason teens look forward to college is because in college they get to meet new people and get to learn alot more in detail the subjects they most enjoy. Also in college they get to move out of home and have alot more freedom than they would have at home. But some young people at this point in life are learning to take responsabilities and that sometimes is a hard task to learn when they have not really been brought up with it. 
	What young people are out looking for is traveling, boyfriends/girlfriends, school, parties, money and maybe even once in a while parents. If we look at it from this point of you most loder people have already lived their life to the fullest. They have had children and are probably about to have frandchilderen. Maybe to young poeple that is not exciting but to older people im sure that is the best time of their life, just because they have seen and experienced it all. 
	This question is so generalised that there are so many different points of views, but this is just one. Also we have to keep in mind that young people have problems as well as older people. For example sicknesses or familly probelms to both young and older people."
806,0,"First of all. I agree with "" most advertisements make products seem much better than thy really are."" because If  I have company then I make some advertisments for some products. And I show them in the TV for the people , also I show them in the streets , but I shwo them in a bad way. I mean they were seem bad or ugly. Then nobady going to by anything from my commpny. they going to put ex on it(all the people goning to heat it).
  Any way any one wants to make an advertisements have to show them seem gret way . To attreact  people  to that kind of product wich mide the advertisements for it.
 Here is the example for two people mide two advertisments for two  diffrent kinds of bayby milk. The first ont showed the bayby milk  with darty stuff and with sick child. Also the pearson showed that advertisment with bad music. The second one showed  the bayby milk with clean stuff and with cutte bayby. Also with nice music . Now here is the bottom line. The people who wictched the two advertisements, wich kind of milk they are going to buy?. Difnlay the second one, because it has really great stuff and really great way to ahwo the bayby milk.
   That even in other products. itis depend how the product showing. and wht the gifts come with it. Also if it has good offer or not. I mean it is depend how is the product shwoing.
    That was my opinion if I agree or disagree with""most  advertisments make products seem much better than the really are.""
And igreed with that."
4778,0,"In my country, there is an old say ; to teach the way of take fishes instead give fishes. It says important of learing not only the fact but also the  ""the way"". But it highlight that the important of the way.  Like this old say, I agree that student to understand ideas and concets is more important than to learn facts.

First, If students understand ideas and concepts then they can understand more difficult questions. For example, when I was middle school student, at first time of math class, I couldn't understand what teacher said. But finally understood the way of solution, I could solve another math questions. Although that question was more difficult, I understood the way of solution so I could do it. If I couldn't understnad, I couldn't solve that question.
Sesond, If student understand idea and concepts, they can imagine
more idea nad concepts. I mean, for instance, when I was high school student, I learnd about poet. Most of people don't like poet because of words. That words were difficult to understood except teacher. Teacher could understood all of words. That is why that is important  to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts,
I couldn't understand because I did'nt have any idea.

So I agree about that statement."
2458,0,"Most advertisements seem to make products seem much better than they really are. Most advertisement seems to emphasize too much of their benefits or vital points in their products. To make the advertisements more effective, people work for the advertisements use more color, put overstatements about the products in good way, and use popular actors, actresses, and even singers to make the effects bigger. In general, customers should not believe in too much for the advertisements itself. 
 	I have two examples to show how the way advertisements work. One is that the advertisement of CAMEL cigarette, there are actually two advertisements paper for men and women. But the common point is that there is a man and woman who look beautiful and look cool with the cigarette on its both advertisement. The advertisements want consumers to think to be looked cool or even mature when they smoke like the model on its advertisements. 
	The other example is about nutrition pills. There are many kinds of pills or powders such as diet pill, protein powder, Omega 6 pills, etc and its advertisement affects people greatly. Those advertisement make people think their body look not nice even if they really do not, and let them buy those pills to loose weight or make mascle. Some people might believe if they take big amount of protein powder, they would make huge muscle which they want. However, the truth is they cannot. Those protein powder does not help to make more muscle. People who buy the protein power are just waisting their money. 
	    People can buy anything they want in this society. However, many of them do not realize how they are affected by those advertisement when they go shopping and choose things to buy. Customers have to know only what they really need to buy, but not for the products they think atractive because of its advertisement.
Be a smart shopper."
7761,0,"I agree with the statement provided that the word in the statement ""cars"" is qualified to mean only ""road-cars"". This is to distinguish road-cars from other automotives, like space-cars, which may be a thing of the future. I will hence-forth call such automobiles as personal-flights, to distinguish them from ""road-cars"".

As a science student, I am totally convinced that twenty years is sufficient for technological advancements to progress to such an extent, so as to enable the the usage of personal flights by many people. In those years, people will be able to purchase personal-flights, and hence the usage of road cars will become outmoded. Twenty years may be short to produce such personal-flights at low rates. However although all people may not have luxuries to such high end automobiles, a significant portion of the population, especially in developed countries may start using them regularly. Besides, the government of those days might introduce other sophisticated public transport systems, like space buses or space trains. Considering the heavy pollution that is caused by the today's cars and the great commotion caused in today's roads because of these cars, people then may start exploring other options, such as space -buses. That would not only be convenient to most people, but also be environment friendly. In fact, some environment friendly countries, might totally abandon the usage of powered vehicles on roads of that day. People who wish to go on roads on those days might go on cycles, and it is entirely possible that cycles might be in vogue then. The usage of road-cars may be restricted to luxury sports like Formula 1, Nascar etc. 

The other important factor that may influence people to consider other attractive alternate means of transport is petrol and other gas reserves. The acute shortage of petrol, diesel etc in coming years may increase their prices so much that people wil start abandoning road-cars. 

Even as of today, trains in Japan and in few other countries can move almost on the air, enabling them to travel as fast as sound. Current research indicates that space cars may be manufactured without the usage of petrol. They also do not cause enviroment problems, and traffic jams will be a thing of past. In twenty years, the advent of space cars and space buses is looking highly possible."
5658,0,"I think in my opinion that successful people try things and take risks rather than only doing what they know.I think that succesful people are the type of people who are not scared of anything and they are ready to take the risk without  looking at the negative side of it.And if they look at it they try to solve or change these negative things to positive things.

The succesful people are people who take the risk knowing that it might be wrong or it might also be right.They are people who study the risk they are taking from all sides.They know what to do in the right time.These people try new things and take the risk because they know what is correct and they know what to choose.The succesful people are ordinary people who were like us but the only difference between us and them, is that they have brave heart and are ready to take the risk without looking at the consequences.Their are a;ot of examples in the world of people who took alot of risks and became famous and succesful.The most famous example of a succesful man in the world in my opinion is Bill Gates.I think so because when he and his friend invented the 'windows Program'they new that it was a risk to invent it and sell it.But when he took the risk  he was on the right track,his money started increasing.He became the worlds richest man and the owner of one of the biggest companies in the world.

  So i think that succesful people are ordinary people like us but the difference between us and them is that they are the first in taking the risk, without looking at what the resuly will be.I think that their a lot of people who can be like them.but the only problem is that they are not brave hearted like the succesful people."
2001,0,"Fist of all I think will be useful an historic approach, let's see how community influenced young people's life in past times. We can consider the first half of 20th century, we can image that the society had a solid structure that ruled the way young people should behave. Since they were children, because of the more spreaded poverty (especially after the war) and because the limited open-minded of the higer classes (that were often very influenced by old traditions), they were automatically scheduled in fixed school programs or they were obliged to work at early age because of the lack of money, as a result the spare time was considerably reduced. These conditions were usual and widespread in common people and changed in some way youngs' opinion through society. Nowadays i think society has reached an higer level of opportunities for young people, mainly because of the growth of whealtness and the reduced power of traditions. They most part of them can now attempt school and has also a most variety of choce. I think it's not true that nowadays young people don't spent enough time to helping the society, well maybe not as much as in the past but i think that the quality of the time they spent is much higher, they are investing in themselves in order to be able to help the soviety in the future"
5741,0,"I do not think that in twenty years there will be less cars in use than today. It is no likely to happen because automobiles represent a huge engine for today's economy and some people won't let their gold mine to be closed. 

	For example, lets think about the tire industry and the position of Goodyear or Pirelli about the decrease in the number of cars in the near future. I have no doubts they would use as many resources as they have to undermine every idea or project that could result in a contraction of their market. 

	Another example is the fuel industry, better said the business of Mobil, BP, Texaco and a few more brands. They have been investing billions of dollars trying to avoid the development of alternative sources of energy for automobiles. Their biggest business is to produce car's  fuel and they won't let it go so easily. If they are contrary to car transformations, logically they will fight fiercely against automobile diminishing. 

	Another example of how economic issues won't let the number of cars go smaller is the fact that public investment in the western countries consists mainly in road building. About 50 % of the public budgets all around the western countries are used to aloud car circulation. If the number of that kind of vehicles radically goes down, it will produce a huge administrative collapse since the traditional political economy would be mennaced. 

	In conclussion, neither the tire industry, nor the fuel producers or the public planners and administrators of the western countries will aloud the numbers of cars in use to decrease. In fact, I think  in twenty years the economic pressure around the car related industries and economic fields will not only impede the decrease, but will boost the automobile use."
2464,0,"I believe successful people like to take risks and are not afraid to engage new situations. Success is being in control of one self in order to achieved certain goals. If you believe you can do it, you have much higher chances to obtaining that. Successful people are motivated to try new things, to be creative, and to follow objectives even if the situation changes. 

Successfull people differ from ordinary people becasue they take risks. For example: Most of all great business ideas are innovative. What makes a business man successful is the way he or she manages to develop the business model. Most probably, it will requiere to invest both time and money to an entrepeneur activity. It will also requiere to learn new things, maybe processes and managerial skills. To do so, it demands to learn new things and to take risks. 

In the other hand, ordinary people are most likely to stay where they are, in what I call comfort zone. They are not willing to take chances, and usually bypass great oportunities because they believe that it is too risky or too hard to achieve. 

Basically, I differentiate people by their attitud. Successful ones, have a positive attitud toward change and are self confident. They believe thay can achieve it. And even if they fail, their attitud rise them up again to keep on developing greater ideas. Success is a continious activity, not a goal you reach and it is over. 

They are many examples of success. I like to state my own experience. I have worked for 3 years achieving professional goals, and learning new activities. I have been recognized for my committment, and now I work as General Manager for the company. I have great attitud toward change and problem solution. I have made my mistakes but always learned from them. I believe everything is posible when you are clear about it. Now a days, I am on my way to study a specialized master degree, ready to learn new things, to share my own ideas and listen to others. 

I believe  success is a way of living."
7648,0,"For as long as this sophisticated society has existed, people have debated which advertisements effectively work to attract consumers. Although this issue may never resolved to everyone's satisfaction, the matter is very clear in my mind: I disagree with this statement. Many advertisements do not make products seem much better than they really are.

     That not all advertisements success to attract consumers is evident for several reasons. To begin with, some advertisements discourage people to purchase the products. To illustrate, in many countries, the advertisements of tobbacos have warming sentences on them. When I traveled in Australia, I detected that even the photos of lung cancers were used in the advertisements. In this case, the advertisements warn us the possibility of danger that is caused by using the products. Indeed, the advertisements of tobbacos do not makes products better. 

     Furthermore, some advertisements utilize an unique strategy to attract consumers. For example, Yukiguni-maitake, Japanese  food products company, uses the conspicuous strategy: Its advertisement says that do not buy its products. This advertisement is unusual, therefore, many consumers are attracted and finally buy the products. In view of this, the advertisements sometimes apply unique strategy which does not appeal merits of the products. 

     Nevertheless, some critics claims that the advertisements' role is to appeal the products. However, the fact, as detailed above, reveals that some advertisements try to prevent customers from buying their products.

     In conclusion, I believe that the advertisements usually use different strategies to attract customers. It is clear from my examples."
3855,0,"I disagree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are. Because  the truth of the thing is always right way for everything.The advertisements make producets seem much better that can't to stand forever.
  First reason I think the products didn't need to seem much better thatn they really are that because when I go to the shop center to buy something, I usually need that and we will buy it. If we bring it go home and found it isn't well as we saw at the shop center. I will fell sad. And I will remember its name then I will never to buy the thing of the name again. Actually the advertisement make products seem much better than they really are, that means they wants to sale a lot of products. If every customs will never buy it at the second time. I think that is the obside what they want. That may make the children to learned the bad habits.
  Second reason I think we need keep the truth of the products is because we need keep the truth for everything. When a little child came with his mum and saw the process of thing as same as the fovered. He may be learned from it and do something as same as that. He won't do the truth of the thing.That the trouble with the future.
  Finally, I think if we can work hard for everything. And try to do the best. Then we will not need some advertisements make products seem much better, and the products will be the best.  To show the truth of the things may be not well at that time, but it is a good way to change to the best."
1782,0,"I totally disagree with this statement. I think youg people should make effort to help their communities because they must be one of the members of the communities. 
	Firstly I think all people should cooperate with each others. Within the community there are many kind of people, such as youg children, adults, or eldery people. Many of them are needing help. Especially elder people need help. Now there are big number of elder people in Japan and there are fewer of those who can assist them. Generally many young adults have their kids  and they do not have much time to help pthers and many adults have their job and they also have no time to help. But how about youg peopele such as university students? They just have paranty of time. Of course, I think studying or working part time job must be important, but they should make some time to help elder people and help therir community.
	Second of all if young people help communities they can be learned by others in the same communities. If one  helps community they have to talk with or have soem rerationship with others. Though this process they can learn a lot of things which schools would not  provide, such as traditions or old experiences. Fow example, when I was in my hometown I sometimes went to a kind of meeting  of elder people with my grandmather. They talked me or other youg people about some great story based on their experience. The oen I was the most impressive was his own experience in the war time. Since no youg pepole have experienced the war at all, we should listen to the real stroy by the real person who actually had experienced it. Though reading article is good, it would be lack of reality, I think.
	For these reason, I think youg people help community and learn form them."

For example before the last reform of school Italian university give you many academic subjects and less specific subject, you study in university a lot of book and after university you don`t know the way for enter in word`s job. For a students is very difficult understanding the applications of information in a jo.
I think that the general academic subjects is important for myself and specific subject too. The best way for me to improve your culture and found a good job is that you have to learn very well all the informations that school give you and after that ,during the work, this information have to use for do a good job.
Now Italian University is building in a different way than the past. You study for 3 years many academic subjects(many information about a different kind of disciplins) and the and of this 3 yeas you have a degree of first level. After you decide if you continue your studies or not. If you continue to study you can choose one specialization and learn one specific subject for 2 years, during this time yuo  at the and you have a degree of second level.
In short I think that is better that I learn many academic subjects for improve my culture and my life at the same time I learn one specific subject for found a job that I like me."
4075,0,"Accoding to my opinion young people do enjoy life more than old people do.The first reason that  supports my opinion is the age factor.  Young people are free from troubles or fears that come with old age . Talking about  the fear , i mean the fear of  death and the fear of physical ailments that come with old age. Although old people  are free from the basic responsibilities of life but still they cant enjoy their freedom from responsibilites the way they want or deserve because of thier old age and the problems that come with it.Young people  live  with energy and a youthful and positive attitude towards life. Even though they have responsibilities and goals to achieve , but still they are always filled with energy and an attitude to achieve what they want from life .This is because they are free from all the barriers that come hand in hand with old age.These barriers discourage old people from enjoying life to the fullest. They are nomore in a mental and physical situation to accept challenges in life. They are not capable of setting goals in life and this inturn keeps them away from the ecstacy and joy of achieving a goal that younger people have the ability to enjoy. 
Another point of view would be the advancement in technology and the generation gap. The older genration is still suffocating in the claws of orthodox and conservative ideas which also stops them from enjoying life to  full extent. They are also unaware of the technological improvements that have taken place and are also not ready to identify with them. They still want to stand by their old orthodox traditions and dont open themselves to the fresh breeze of todays world.They want to keep a closed mind and dont want to breathe in the fresh air of the modern world.All these factors act as big barriers in the way of their enjoyment ."
7060,0,"I disagree with the statement 'the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide'. I would like to putforth examples and situations I personally have experiences to support my opinion.
   A person who travels alone I believe will have a lot more independency in making his own decisions rather travelling along with a tour guide. With a tour guide we see our desicion being influenced by the guide and we get to see places the guide wants us to see rather than what we want to see. It was in my school trip that my classmates and myself had a pretty bad exerience with the guide appointed to us. The guide would take us to places we didn't want to see and he being a localite got us into a hotel that was quite expensive, because by doing so he would get a commission from the hotel authorities for getting them customers. Other than that we had some other bad exeriences only because of the reason that the guide was a localite and was looking for grabbing commission wherever we went.
   The best advantage in travelling alone would be that we could find out about a place by interacting with the localites or getting a copy of the local travel guide to guide us to the best places of visit. In today's advanced world we get to have the information of a place on our fingertips through the internet. We also have amazing travel guide books that come in various languages and help us in getting a feel of the local culture. 
  I would like to end the topic on the point that I took this decision based on my personal experience and the other travel experiences that where great just because of the fact that we didn't take guide along."

	Beeing specialized in on e specific subject doesn't mean that you are going to ignore the other parts of knowledge which may be sometimes more important to know. The advantages of beeing specialist in on part of the life sience is that you will concentrate on what you are doing and this will lead a person to be creative in his work and to live with an ambition that will lead him to fight to achive his desired goals in that field. Now days the community needs those specialists because of thier good experiences and thoughts about what they are doing in thier majors, for examples , the home designers , film directors , photographers, engineers and others all of these are specialists and imagine a community without them. Even though the companies, they are paying alot for those people who are talented in thier majors to do thier job completed in an aacurate and efficient ways 

	Knowledge about other things is a must and life requires that must. So I agree that the person should cocentrate on his field first and then he should know some part of knowledges that he needs, to improve his life and to be able to comunicate with other knowledges and to learn from them what they know.

	
	
	The community will never be improved or developed if there is no specialists, and cultures will not be formed if there is no specialists where every person is doing his job to form a beautiful culture finally at the end."

Joining community is good way to learn any little society of the group. The young people should take communication in the community place as possible as they can. Now, we have a many ways to communicate with person who you are interested in. Unfortunately, some younger generations does not like to give enough time to helping their communities. 


First, Giving enough time to their community is the important for yong people. I understand that some yong people would like to be alone thermselfs and keep their own time. Sometimes, it is good chance to think own proble just themselves , however, the person who joined the community may gives a second opinion. 

Also, in the young people community, they can meet your friends in the community. We do not alive without our community. In my experices, I found my best friends in my communities when I was 17years old. 

Finally, young people should give to help their communities.  Young people can learn any educational experiences from their communities. Sometimes young people communies make some troubles but you should not be shy to join community."
10007,0,"I do not agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do.

There are some reasons that might suggest this as for example that younger people are normally more healthy then older people. Of course if an old person has to use a wheelchair he is going to enjoy his life less than a younger one without wheelchair. Also younger people might have less obligations and responibilities than older people. Studying is assumed to be mainly fun.

But this seems to be a popular illusion. Today, through the advance of medicine, older people are healthier than ever before. Also, today students are aware of the fact that their future depends on their success in studies. This means that they have a lot of obligations and responsibilities too.

And old people can also choose a life with only minor obligations and responsibilities. Actually they can live like young people. Older people have made their experiences. According to their experiences they have chosen how to live. They have all opportunities like young people plus experience. Young people have to spend their time to their education. They can't build a family for example. For most people having a family is still the most satisfying experience. Also they depend during their studies on the money of their parents. Older people however earn their own money. They have more money to spend and they can decide what to do with their money.

Another point is that enjoyment of life does not depend on age. The differences mentioned above are mainly dependant on the person. You can enjoy yeour life when you are young and you can enjoy zour life when you are old. Most things you can do in both stages, like meeting friends, visiting concerts and so on. The important thing is how you take life. You are always going to face problems whether you are young or old. The decisive things is how you cope with the problems."
4455,0,"I agree that the, it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts, for several resones. 

      First, this is the way of studing. If the students want to be seccessful in their study they must to understand the ideas and concepts first. For example, if the student has a giugraphy class and the teacher gave hime or her the information what he or she needs. But they are ideas, and they agnist the facts. Then, the same studen has an exam in the same class. And he or she faced a qustion about the information, which is the teacher gave him or her. Then, he or she wanted to write the answer to that qustion and the answer was an idea, which is agnist the fact. If the studen wrote the fact, he or she will miss the point, but he or fhe wrote the same onformationn , which is the profassor has given her or him, he or she will get the point. Therefore, this is very important.

     Second, it be helpfull for students on the futuer and incress the knowlge of them. How it is come? learning the idea  and the concepts is leading to facts. For example, if the students learn the ideas and the concepts, then they knew there are facts about the same things that will encorge them to find the facts. And if they kept in the same way, which is understand the idea and the concepts, then they will have really great knowlge and that will help them in the future. Therefore, the that will incress the students' knowlge.

     In short, it is nice to learn facts too but I still agree that was why I agree that "" it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is fot them to learn facts. "" So, ideas and concepts then facts."

Technology is one of the most important things that is making them busy, such as internet, video games, television and alot more. It seems to be that they spend so mush time playing and using these things without knowing how much time they are wasting. You see them play video games for hours, but do nothing for their communities. There are so much to do and so much to give but ignorance is the problem. 
Children must be tought in school how to help and give, but the first place to learn that is at home. Parents doesn't know the importance of teaching their children how to help with their communites.
Children should do charity work and they also should help poor people and people with physical and mental disabilities. Parents should plant in them the beauty of giving, helping and caring. 
also teenagers, they should learn that to. now all they care about is what to wear and where to go and whats new in fashion. i know they are teenagers and they should live their age but this doesnt hold them from helping their communities. 
  
   there are so many stuff to do for their communities especialy her in Saudi Arabia. so i strongly agree with the statment. i think that we should take this problem more serious because the way young people are now is not the way we want them to be n the future. as a start i will talk to many people i know who can help me in this case and hopefully i will make a change in my community and i am sure that many children and young people will respond if we talk to them the rght way."

My sister buys a lot of products very cheapy but after a season she can't use their because are broke and I am very tired with my sister.

223,0,"I strongly agree that advertisements make products  seem better. One should not be suprised by that because that is the goal of advertisement. In short, adverstisements want the consumer to buy the product whether or not he has a health benefit.

What always come to mind is the advertisements for cigarettes. In much of these adverstisements, you see either a beautiful woman or hansome man and immediately you want identify with them. Therefore you want to imitate their acts, i.e. smoke. The other point about cigarettes advertisements is the ""element of freedom"". Most adverstisements show vast pieces of land or sea to suggest somekind of escape or adventure but it actually an illusion.

The other type of advertisements that I would like to talk about is children snacks. On television the snacks looks very delicious and appetizing but in fact they have no nutritious value. Advertisers use bright colors, with catchy rythms to entice children to buy their products. When you look at the nutritional value of the product, you realised that it's full of saturated fat or even  trans fat. Kids love it because it tastes good. Some parents may like it because it's convenient to prepare it.

The last point that I would like to make is commercial for cars. Everyday that you turn the television on, there is a new advertisement about a new car or the new model of an old car. You are constanly reminded to change you car even if you don't have too. What most people seems to ignore is that cars run on gasoline and we all know that cars are the biggest emitters of carbon dioxide (CO2). Most cars companies advertisements will not promote the use of public transportation to cut the emission of Carbon Dioxide in order to save Mother Nature."
7153,0,"Giving a real contribution to the community is an important social aspect. In my own opinion the time dedicated to this purpouse should take a part in the life of any of the members of a community.
I disagree with the statement because I think that young people nowadays is the most invoved in helping their community. 
Many of my friends give their contribution to different social assotiacions and they do not earn money for that. They simply do that because they believe in the importance of their help. 
I think that young people is more involved in helping communities rather than grown ups.
This could be ascribed to the different amount of time which they have.
Grown ups are more likely involved in career and in family so they are not able to dedicate a large amount of time to this purpose. Instead,  young peole has more free time and, in addiction, less worries to deal with. Therefore is reasonable that they use this chance to help other people in the community.
However, acccording to me there is also another reason for young people is larger involved in giving their time for the health of the community. A young man is tipically more idealistic and full of enthusiasm. Therefore we can immagine how a boy can enjoy the idea of helping people spontaneusly. On the contrary a father might prefer to use his time and his sources to help his own family.  
In conclusion I think that young people firmily believe to share their time and sources to help the community. The result, can be seen in all the widespread activities and no profit association that we commonly meet. Therefore I am pretty proud of the way the people of my age deals with the need fo help in the community."
4240,0,"It has been said that, 'In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today'. It could be true since the fuel that we use now to run cars are running out, but however I disagree with the statement and I will present briefly why I disagree that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.

	First reason is that population is growing rapidly, and people are live longer nowadays. More people means more cars, people wants convinience in their life more than anything else, people growth are growing since we have revolutionized industrial and medical care, medical care we have increased our estimate lives. As I mentioned more people are being born and live longer they're going to be willing to use more cars.

	Second reason, and the problem I've mentioned about fuel, the fuel we now use is 'gasoline' and I know that it's limited and some scientists said that it'll run out quicker than we think, but that is just like saying that we won't be finding the replacement, we've revolutionalize in many ways and we've been making new technology to make our lives better, just couple hundred years ago gasoline was a junk but now it's a most important thing in our lives, just like we've found gasoline we're going to find something else just as important and capable as gasolines did.

	In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today and It could be true since the fuel that we use now to run cars are running out, but I totally disagree with this statement because our human being have developted more and more and we're going to develop our lives even faster since popluation is growing, and soon we'll find a perfect replacement for the fuel we use to run cars."

   The second is that in Europe and U.S.A. the public kind of transportation are forever in amount and the car began an older kind of transportation.
   I think that the second way is the best solution for this big problem of cars numbers in the world, and so I agree with this question: in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today."
11191,0,"I support that successful people try out new things and take risks than only doing what they have already know how to do well.

                        I believe that success, in any form gives human being a different way of thinking and doing things. Success may be in any form i.e., it may be in the form of money or fame or in any other form.This gives a man to think in a different way from the usual thinking and trying out  things differently.They try to do things in a new fashion and not in the way that they have already done or in a way that they knew. There are some characteristics developed in these successful people along with the success. These successful people dare to take risks and work out things differently. 

                                 For an instance, theres a difference in doing the things by a very rich man when compared to a poor man. Here, success, in the form of wealth changes the thinking of the rich man and he tries doing things in a different manner. For example, the rich man goes to a very costly restaurant, clothes himself heavily, moves in a costly car and dines at different places. A middle class man can do all these acts performed by a rich man, but he does not exceed his limits.This is success in the form of wealth which makes the rich man to work out things differently.

                               Consider success in the form of fame.The highly famed people does things differently when compared to the normal people.They arrive to new ideas of working things out. In this case, due to the fame of these successful people, they dare to take risks in any form as they are famous. And if anything undesirable happens, they are backed by their fame.

                                  All the people that are successful, try to work things in a different manner and are prepared to take risks rather than doing things in the manner that they already know.

                                    Their ability of thinking that they can manage the consequences of the things workedout in a different way keeps them going on doing things in a different manner.They are ready to take risks as they are successful and as they think, they can handle the situation and the results of workingout things differently."
9363,0,"Rapid developement of car industry continues to supply cars to every organisation and company and even to every house  in a country. I believe that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years of time. The reasons for the decreasing usage of cars could be that the cars are causing air and noise pollution, besides  harming the worlds and countries natural sources. And as the technology develops other types of transportation could be more commonly used.

As most of the big cities around the world encounter traffic problem, the cities have great air and noise pollution. The population in a big city keeps growing with migrations. The governments should develop solutions to the usage of so many cars. As a best solution public transportation could be spread. If public transportation is encouraged there will be less polution and less cars.

When the natural resources are taken in to account, if each individual has a seperate car then more and more fuel will be wasted. The natural resoruces like fuel is becoming to an extinction problem. In the future other new sources could be introduced to be used in cars enginees but extereme usage of cars will endanger these sources as well. So the solution again will be usage of fewer cars.

Other than cars, there is airplanes, ships and trains that can be used for transportation. As for far distances airplanes are announced to be easiest and safest way of travelling. So in the future other types of transportations will probably become more commonly used.

In conclusion, there will be fewer cars used in twenty years time as need for  cleaner air, keeping of resources and other transportaions will be"
4249,0,"I believe that the young people nowadays are at least trying to give enough time to help their communities. It seems as if we are not helping at all because we do not have enough time in our lives to fully commit a hundred percent of ourselves in the service. However, we can help others little by litte. What are our communities anyway? Are they countries or neighbors? At least my school, American School In Japan, focuses on service to our communities, both countries and neighbors. 
	I recently joined a club in my school called Sok Sabay, which supports cambodian orphanages to provide home and food supply. It is a non-profit organization and all of our profits that we make as a club goes straight to the shelter in Cambodia. We sometimes collect clothes, pencils, toys, and books for children and send them. Then we get thanks letters from those children, which is are primary source of our happiness and motivation for commitment in the club. Sok Sabay is not the only non-profit organization in my school. There are Habitat for Humanity, Phillipine Relief Organization, and UNICEF. Most of the students join in one of those clubs, and some of them even join in all of them. Although we are busy with our lives, we do try to somehow be in part of the service program for other countries. 
	I am also in National Honor Society, which strongly focuses on service program, especially towards our neighbor communities. We make rice balls for homeless people on the weekends, and visit orphanage shelter about once a month. Although it is optional to attend those acitives, most of the members of NHS help willingly. We also support the Runnathon acitivity once a year with American Club. Moreover, we have meetings almost every week to keep in our minds that we are NHS members and it is necessary to think about the issues of service programs. We actively help and support our neighbors. 
	Although there are young people who do not care about others at all, I believe that people in my school are different. We know somehow that we should be in part of some services, or at least think about it. I do not believe in necessity of having enough time for service. Nothing is enough, therefore, we need to keep reminding ourselves that taking an action worths while. Even a little action can help someone, and that is how my school builds the sense of service towards others."

I think it happens for several possible reasons.
One possible reason is that the life today is earier than before.
Today we often have a lot of money. My mother usually tell me that when she was young she has only two or three dress. I think it is incredible! I have a huge amount of dress!
A second possible reason is that in a city now there is an incredible amount of cinemas, pubs, restaurants. There are several opportunities to enjoying.
Furthermore each family has a car. A car allow to move people easier than before.

8770,0,"I fully agree with the statement, because it's just what I've always done in my life, every time I had to learn a new thing. I always try to focus on concepts and not on facts, so I can understand the reason why something happens and not simply how or when it happens. In this way it's much easier for me to remember the huge number of things I need to remember for my studies or even for my job. I think that this way of learning lets you remember things for the rest of your life, because once you learn how to ride a bycicle, you cannot forget it anymore. Even if you do not use it for many years, your brains can still remember how to ride it. Maybe you need some minutes to revive your technique, but after only five minutes, you are able to ride it again as many years before. In the same way, you can learn theoretical concepts, like long and appearently complicated formulas, just trying to understand what is behind them and how to re-create them from scratch, starting from the concept that they represent. Instead, if you just concentrate on facts, like sequences of events, dates or other ""useless"" information, you may be able to remember them for a certain period of time, but definitely not as long as you live. Actually there may be important facts to remember, but this is not the point. In a few words, I would say that the most important question we have to ask ourselves as students is ""Why?""."

I agree with that satement. to understand ideas and concepts are more important than it is for them to learn fact. first, to understand ideas and concepts leave long time to mind. second, to understand make students find facts themselves. these reasons developing this essay.
  Frist, to understand ideas and concepts leave long time to students mind or brain. That means, just learn facts are not going to leave temporaty to students. because they know about facts thus they are not try to find facts. for example, I have been read the article which is about student's studying behavior. it tells about when students solve the threir math problems, some student can see the answer sheets, however others can't. the result is to solve the math problems without the answer sheets students keep try to understand find the answer and to understand.
  Second,  to understand ideas and concepts make students find facts thenselves. if before they knew about the fact of problem, they do not want to get proof of the problem. it makes student lazy. if always students get fact easily, they can not adoped with to understand idea. for example, here is one student, who knows fact but does not know how to~? or why? that student can not develop own ability. 
  In conculusion, the best way is to understand ideas and concepts and than find or learn fact. and the fastest way is to learn facts. however, student have to learning whatever also they have to keep trying own their works. therefore more important for atudents to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts."

674,0,"It is often thought that young people enjoy life more than older people do, but is it really true? A young person and an old person differ completely in terms of social status, experiences, physical abilities and other factors which can explain that statement. Let`s analyze them.


   First of all, old people can sometimes be limited physically because of their age and it can prevent them from doing all they would like to do. Simple things of life can be difficult such as going shopping, driving, or maybe going out with friends. All this difficulties added together can make their life more difficult to enjoy.
   Moreover, older people often have more responsibilities in terms of family or professional goals. This can create a lot of stress, psychological tensions which prevent people from enjoying life at its maximum. However, I have to say that having a family (children...) is not only a source of stress...and can therefore be a great cause of happiness!

   On the contrary, young people are often more `free` psychologically as they are more unconscious than older people and want to experience life in a fun way and to enjoy it. They often do not have the preoccupations linked to a family or a professional situation. Consequently, they can be more selfish and have fun in life.
   We also have to notice that young people often do not have the  same problem of money than when they get older. Most of the time, the parents supply their chidren with money and all their material requirements. It is thus an important worry which dissapears and allows in one sense young people to enjoy life.


   Finally, we arrive to the conclusion that young people enjoy life more than older people do because in a way, they are sometimes unconscious about some worries or problems which can exist in an older person`s life. However, some people prefer to make sacrifices during their youth and then enjoy life when they are older whereas other people make the opposite... But which is the best solution to enjoy life as much as you can?"
11991,0,"I strongly believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are for several reasons.

First of all, the marketing has been always worked behind the objective of :""sell... as much as you can the product"",...and how do they know how to sell us something? how do they know how to make us buy what they want us to buy? Well, first of all, they study the consumers.
In my opinion, it's more than obvious that everybody wants the best price based on quality everytime they are going to buy a product. This is not something easy, because if a business create something with high quality and sell that product cheap, they would never get a good profit of it. So, is you create a product, at a price, and you want to sell as much as possible, how are you going to do it? Well, there is where the marketing, and therefore, the advertisements, enter in our discussion. It's seems something easy, but it's not. The first thing they have to do is study the consumer, what they need, at what price, when and how much. If the product that they are trying to sell, has everything the consumer wants, perfect, they did it! but that is very very difficult, because no all the consumers are the same, it affects the age, the sex, where are they from, what they like...so, the solution is make the product and make it look like the consumer wants it to be.  It can sound strange, but I think that the objective of the advertisement is try to sell you something they want you to buy, sometimes a product that you really need for your life, but sometimes they create you wehat I called, artificial need.
Lets just try to think about us, I'm sure there has been at least one time in the life of everybody that had bought something that it seemed great on television and then it isn't as good as we thought.
My experience was buying a car, it looked amazing on television and it has a great price too, but something cheaps costs you expensive... everybody was buying this car, so I decided to buy it and, at least, it wasn't as amazing as I thought at first.

In conclusion, I strongly agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are, because the objective of the advertisement is to sell you something and make you buy it, even if its as good as it seems, or not."

	Normal people also stops doing the work if they completed it doing or solving it. But, successful people try's to do they same work in a different or new manner. They use their own way of thinking to solve the same problem. They may think every matter in another way and try to solve it. Successful people also dares to do anything. They take risks without hesitation.

	They love to take risks. they trys very hard for doing anything. For example, a person might think of keeping a restaurant. Firstly, he should take a risk over that business. Because, it may raise the prices or low down the prices . Normally people starts a work and if it goes down they will stop it continuing and goes to another one. But, successful people doesnt stop it they even try to do some more improvements and start doing the work.

	Once it might go wrong but, latter they will definetly succed. Because, hard worker doesn't gets the failure. successful people not only succed they even go to higher position because, once if the business goes nicely they wont stop looking at them , they think of improving it in another way by extending their business to further more what people needed. Thus, the successful people take risks in everything they do."
8991,0,"Everyone can enjoy life whatever the situation is, how old they are and how much money they got. The important thing is that if a person is aware of enjoying time is an essential of his/her life. In my opinion, I strongly believe that the young people enjoy their life more than older people do. I am going to explain my reasons of this belief in the next sections.

Firstly, young people are more open to new ideas and mostly they are willing to try new things that they did not experience before. Trying new things like paragliding, a game, swimming in cold water make someone's life more excieted. Having fresh bodies may also help to exhibit these new offers and wishes. Since the action is more easy event in the youngness.

Secondly, young people have not so much responsibilities like paying house credit, buying newer car or going to more expensive places for dinner.Thus, they can take more risks than normally older people do. Then they can move more easly then older people do since they have not settled down totally. Adventuring new places also gives pleasure to everyone. A cheap trip to North America is an opportunity for young people while an older person would asks which hotel to stay, how long vacation is need.

Lastly, young people do not have proper job, and they have plenty much time for doing something else. Assume that, I have plenty time to spend on my own. I would like to do my staff that I have already delayed but after finishing them I probablt will be get bored and think about what to do else. This brain storming gives new ideas to try. But this needs time to do and all other staff should be completed before it.

Despite of having enough money and being mature enough, I believe that young people enjoy their life more than older one do in the way of I tried to explain above."
934,0,"I really enjoy to plan my trips by myself or with my girlfriend, it's a sort of pleasure for me to make researches on the web about all the details such as traveling, housing and main destinations, so most likely I disagree with the given stimulus. 
When you experience a tour organized by somebodyelse there are many things which are not under your personal control. Many important decision are often taken by the group and I don't really like to vote on things when I travel, by contrary I like to spend time where it's more valuable accordingly to my taste and personal interest. In addition I think that a guided tour usually presents events which are designed for tourists.
 I still remember when I went to Thailand with my family in 1991 and the tour guide basically was always showing  us cultural events and shows which were very far to be authentic expressions of the local habits.
I prefer to manage my own time during the trips and don't be bothered by any time constraints or scheduled appointments as usually happens with guided tour.
Thus I really like the intimacy of a romantic trip with my girlfriend, so I will eventually consider other options when I'll be older."

2681,0,"Every idea and concept in the world is based on fact and it can't become only if there is fact that relate to it, there is a connector between them,soI dissagree with the statment which says that it is more important reason for students to understand ideas and concept than it is for them to learn facts.
	First, any idea or concept should be supported to be more convincable and people can understand, so there should be at least one kind fact that happen or that known to make that idea or that concept is realistic and strong that can people understand. 
	Second, many idea that don't have facts disappear with the time because they don't have any thing that they are based on it, so most people ignore them and they become useless idea until one of the people aprroved it by a fact or some thing like that.
	Third,  most of people use facts in the writing or research because it make their writing or research more strong and show people that who wrote this article or did this reasearch knows what he is talking about and the writing or the reasearch would be rich of right instead of hypothesis.
	Fourth, many scientists who has won prize of approving that there researchs are right, their reasearhs were basesd on facts that made their reasearh more convence and understand for all the world and their ideas become on of the importants laws.
	In conclusion, facts are very improtant for students becase they are the base of the ideas and concepts by suppoting them to make them convencible, make the articles very rich of right information that helps people,and it can approved our idea and become a law instead of an useless idea."
4618,0,"Planning to see fewer cars in use in twenty years is a good perspective but I can hardly imagine it. I can only consider it as an illusion.
Basically, people enjoy driving to go working, shopping or to the beach. If you live in a city, I would encourage you to observe and count as many cars as possible for one minute. I guess you would be surprised.
It appears to be quite clear that some people really need a car. 
First, a car, it is useful. It is useful by the fact that you can get anywhere, at any time, the way you want. The only thing that may slow you down is traffic jams. And when you live far from any city, any shop, any bus stop,  a car is very useful. 
Then, a car, it can reveal something else. This is part of the thing you can also notice ( when you are observing on the pavement), it is the number of people in the cars. You can hardly see more than two (except when it is a family and when they are two children at the back!). Yes, because owning a car has always been a sign of power. We live in a society where people feel like buying and owning new and often expensive thnigs in oder to be proud of them  and expose them. People who make advertisements know that and have used this idea so many times. And especially the cliche about middle-age men driving  a fast and powerful car. It is said that you could describe people according to the car they've got and vice-versa. I guess in our current societies, it is a sign of power, of prosperity and modernity. And this is not going to change... 
And the last but not least important fact it the evolution, over the last years, of the means of transport in any city all over the world. Bangkok is a good example. The Skytrain as well as the undergroung are sometimes crowded but not so much. There are seats available quite often. 
The only thing you can notice and you have probably been noticing it for a long time now is that the roads keep being flooded by cars! It may be better and less than before but before seeing fewer cars in use, we will probably have to wait more than twenty years."
7572,0,"I dont think all of the young people nowadays are helping their communities but i believe some of them do helping. Sometimes this kind of topics appears in the NEWS or the newspaper. Adults thinks young people dont help and playing around but i dont think it is true.
  Now in the world, many people are working for theirselves, for family, and for the world but adults say they are not helping but is this true? i dont think so. there are a hundred of the young people working for the communities. But why adults say that? maybe because they have not seen it.
  How can they show the adults that they are doing for their communities? do they have to come in front of them and show what they have done? No. young people nowdays are working and helping their communities in their original styles. Forexample the club DJ. From the adults point of view, they can only see is the young people playing arount untill the morning. but they are working hard in their own style and helping their communities. 
  if you look around really carefully, then you can see young people nowadays are giving their time to helping their communities in their original style."
11305,0,"I strongly agree with the statement that it is important for the students to understand the ideas and basic concepts of the particular course they are learnig.Simply learning the course will only get them minimal grades if it is a theoretical subject.But the few subjects which require the in-depth basic knowledge would surely not work in favor of such students. I can elaborate on this from my personal experience. During my graduation course in Mechanical Engineering I came across diversified subjects. Few of them were really not of my very interest but I cleared those subjects with the utmost concentration and honesty.

Subjects like engineering drawing, design of machine elements, dynamics of machinery, etc really requires a great in-dept knowledge and strong basic concepts. What we learn from the text books is just from theoretical point of view but at the same time to relate it with the actual practical experince is very difficult. If the student has all his basic knowledge about the subject clear then he can really relate the book information with the practical field.
If a student is having his basic concepts clear about the subject then he can really continue to learn more about that subject and will be able to grasp on that topic more easily. 

Simply learing the subject because it is mentioned in the syllabus is no good.This type of attitude will not result any thing positive in his/her favor.For any one having a partial or superficial knowledge is dangerous.Such students after their graduation when enter into relative company will find very difficult to acclimate themself with the type of work being done. Because they don't actually know how the particular process is caried out or how the particular machine works.At that time they will try and learn about that process which they are actually supposed to do in their graduation course.At the same time student who has donw with his graduation course with utmost interest and honesty will enjoy working out in the company and will ascend the success ladder must faster than the less interested  student.

In all, students should always try and relate the things which they have learned in books with the practical knowledge; which every one learns during  his/her daily life. When a person relates his work or tries to explain the concept about a particular topic to another person he not only helps the other person but also bolster his own confidence and knowledge about that subject. Person can do this only if he has a good understanding about the subject."
8299,0,"It is very tempting to give a straight answer like ""yes"", young people today are very selfish, they just care about themselves. However before doing that, I would like first to understand what is behind the word ""young people"". Personnaly, I will separate this word into two categories: first, teenagers between 12 to 18-20 years old, I mean people in high school or beginning university and second the young adult between 20 and 25 years old.

Let's start with the first group. I don't really think they are not helping their community. Every day, TV shows example of a school doing goods things for people like cleaning the tags in the subway or signing papers against fur hunting or helping state to clean parks and streets. At that age, young guys just see life in black and white, they are not yet interested in their jobs and how much money they will make. In addition, at school, their teachers really try to motivate them to understand what citizenship means. Sometimes, as I mentioned above, they don't have choice and they are enrolled in school project. So, in conclusion, for that particular group, I disagree with the statement.

Then, the second group is different and I think they are right to be different in a sense they are or will become soon active member of the society, chief of their household and they have to care more about themselves than the previous group. However, I don't mean in any way that at 25 you are right to become selfish. Unfortunately, what we can observe is that, a part from social workers, this group is not realy willing to participate in helping communities.

To conclude, if think it is very important that before jumping into conclusion that we set clearly the defininion of young people because in function of the category they belong to the answer will be different. For the12-20 years old the answer will be ""no"" and then for the 20-25 group the answer is ""yes"" they don't give enough time to community."
10990,0,"in my opinion successful people try new things and take risk in only situation, when they already know how to do well and when they don't know.
the courrage is the fondamental power to try new things and take risk independently to know how to do well.
in my opinion know how to do well help very much.
an example of successful man is my father, he invested last year much money in a new activity in china.
the china is the most place which invest money because the worker don' cost much and the tecnology is such as the western's but with a down cost.
this is a sort of speculation in a new economy.
my father have take many risk because he used bank's money.
his secret is the his great  passion adn ability in economy because in a magician with the contability.
he think to do well to use a company of engineering that is specialized to do cloth with the higher quality in italy.
it ' s very important not demoralize, the moral have always high."
5427,0,"i totally disagree with the statement that ""young people enjoy life more than the older people"". as there is a famous saying ""still young at heart"". the above statement suggests that there is no limitation of age to enjoy life. it's your life and one should enjoy it's each and every single moment he lives, because life is precious and the time which has gone by will never return. it is certainly old fashioned to think that once you get old, you have lost the authority to enjoy. but in this stage of life one should enjoy life to the fullest as you have spend your whole life trying to make both ends meet both personally and professionally at several circumstances. now when your children are grown up and you no longer hold their responsibility, one can spend this important part of his/her life by living upto each and every moment that passes by. 
as when a person is young and full of energy, he gets into the grind of life facing this harsh world. once he comes out of his college and start earning money, he is ultimately engaged with the chores of the family life and faces day to day problems. and now in todays senario, where the world follows the express lifestyle, one has no time to spend with his/her family memebers neither get time for himself so that he can enjoy the variety of things that this life has to offer. he works day and night to earn money just to buy that extra comfort for his retirement. so that he can spend those last days in peace and enjoy rest of the days. 
the very which shows us that we work hard all our lives to improve our retirement, then how can one say that young people enjoy more than older people do. each person does this for himsel, for a secured life later. he adds up mone so that one can enjoy lidfe with ones partner without hassels and problems of daily life."
95,0,"For the discussion of the question whether young people give appropriate time for helping their communities some definitions have to be pointed out in the first place. First of all what means helping the communities? These are probably activities that shape and support a traditional communities, e.g. attending communtiy events such as festivities and celebrations as much as helping out if there is any need of support for example for seniors. 
	Secondly: what means nowadays? Has there really been at time when  this ever worked out properly? The answer of this question touches the first aguement i want to talk about. Of course there has been a change of the situations and the meaning of communities in the western world during the twentieth century. One aspect certainly is the strong increase of the density of population inducing a growth of communities. By becoming bigger and more complex they lost their athmosphere of a defined neighbourhood, whicht definately determined the people""s attitude towards their communtiy.
An aspect whicht also might have affected this attitude are the rising requirements of a successful life. Recently the social pressure for getting a high qualification in order to get a good job became much more important than it was maybe fifty years ago. Especially young people are highly determined by this and this causes an increasing lack of time for a vivid community life.
A nother aspect is certainy the fact, that people have less moral values due to a lack of a religious backround. And I would conclude that there is definately a need for establishing new ethical attitudes among people in general. the question is how to do this.
In the end I would say that to agree the statement one has to define the preconditions of the statement."
9980,0,"People have their own idea whether youth do not give much time to help their neighborhoods. Some people may say that in these days, some young people do not have enough time to help others. In my opinion, however, young people do not give time to help others: they focus on their own things and they are more busy than past younger.
     First, young people have to concentrate on only their works. It is generally agreed that young people can not avoid any competitions such as have a job or enter the university. Therefore, young people do not have enough time to help other people. For example, if they do not focus on their tasks, they cannot survive in modern society. Having a job is the very important thing in their life. They must think only their works for their future. In this way, younger people cannot have time to help others.
     Second, modern society makes young people busy. Some people might think that young people have a lots of spare time such as vacations. However, lots of people enjoy their life at an early age because if they get older they cannot have much time to enjoy their life. For instance, young people make plan at long vacation. They can go abroad or thay can study other major which young people want to learn. In this way, young people nowadays cannot spend their spare time helping their communities.
     To sum up, young people do not have time to help their communities. They have a lot things to do and they must enjoy their time when they are young. All things considered, I can definetely say that youth have difficulty in having time to help their neighbors."
8878,0,"""Yes"", I agree to statement which is given as ""In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today"".

                                        Now-a-days people looking for such good companies which will stay for long time, because now there are so many people  are introducing such new models like ""Accent"",""Zen Maruthy"", and so many other cars model names older and newer, also one company is modifying one companies model and changing a little and releasing it again with their names.

               But only few companies will stay  for long time because they will not depend on other companies models, public believe that companies too.

               I feel  how many years it go only the good product companies stay for long time. Those companies stays for long time their success is in making the goods in convincible manner. Also they will use only perfect engines , looks for better milage, comfortable steering and sitting arrangements with A.C. includnig in future in all type of cars. 
            
             If some cars introducing with better milage ok, what about engine, if engine not much good then the car will not stay for long time and gives so many problems in future . 
         
             In the same way some cars will have some other problems then the cars will not stay for long time and gives the troubles too in the future. 

            Only few companies produce every thing perfectly and they stay for long itme in the future.
        
          By the above points with for and against i can strongly accept the statement ""After twenty years there will be fewer cars i use than there are today""."
6831,0,"What do people usually use to guide them when they are traveling?  I remember two years ago, my friends and I went to New Orleans, Louisiana for a trip.  Before we left, we went online to find all the attractions in the area.  However, we got lost so many times because we did not know the area; nor did we have a tour guide.  Therefore, I agree with the fact that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because having a tour guide will decrease the chance of getting lost, and it will be less likely to get involved in an accident.
	First of all, having a tour guide when traving will decrease the chance of getting lost.  A lot of people, when they go to a certain area for the very first time, inspite of having a map, have the tendency to get lost.  One reason for that is because sometimes the maps that they got online are not updated.  Hence, they get lost on the roads, which can cause them to be angry.  I remember while my friends and I were on our way to a mall, despite the fact that we followed all the directions in the map, we still got lost.  But, we had a tour guide, perhaps, we would not have lost.
	Besides having less chance of getting lost when traveling with a tour guide, the possibility of getting an accident is also low.  In Florida, it is said that lots of people die when they go visit a place due to car accidents.  The reason why is by looking at the map while they are driving.  But if they had a tour guide who knows the area very well, they would be less likey to crash.  Thus, a tour guide would be very helpul when traveling.
	In conclusion, I am strongly in favor of the idea of having a guide when traveling.  For, this will minimize the chance of getting lost and getting an accident."
10401,0,"I do agree with the previous statement. On television we can always see how great current or new products are or work. The producers want to make us buy only their products and they present it as the best one ever. Mostly they also add that their products are especially cheap and that it is necessary to buy it, because without them the customers were helpless. 

A very good example is soap for washing the dishes. In the advertisement the customer is told that the dishes will be extremely clean and shiny after cleaning with that soap. And usually they compare it to the worse 'current' and 'usual' soap. If the customer is convinced by that advertisement he will buy the product, use it and usually see that it does not work as good as the advertisement had told him. He could have also bought the cheaper one from the other store.
Another and similar example is soap for washing clothes. In the advertisement the customer is told that this product will wash the clothes cleaner and 'whiter' than any other product he can find. The customer will go through the same process I have mentioned above.
Also a good example is paste for colouring the hair. In the advertisement is shown how good the product will cover the original hair colour. The customer is convinced and buys the product, but when he uses it he has to notice that the new colour cannot cover the original one the way he would like to. 
One example is also organized tours or holidays. The organisations offer very cheap tours to nice countries with stays in a nice hotel and flights included. Thus they want to make customers use there organisation and those are often paid by hotels to bring cutomers there. But often it happens that the hotel is much worse than it had been described or the arroundings do not look as nice as on the pictures. And the pool described as 'next to the hotel and very nice pool' looks dirty and is far too small for all the hotel guests. Additional to that the food might be bad or the hotel has only two instead of four stars.

Producers use that way of advertisement to get close to the customers and to offer them what those want, but usually the products look much nicer, only to make them attractive to the people."
2815,0,"I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. 
 
 I think profit is the most important for almost every company, so when they advertise their products to the customer, the products have to be look nice so that their customer would buy them. In addition, the company should advertise the products nicer and I think this is a part of their job. For example, when vegetables are advertised on the paper, they usually look fresh and clean but not with dirts. Brcause the company thinks they would better to advertise the clean ones so that many customers might want to go to the shop and buy them.  

 However, as most people have already experienced like this situation. When you see the advertisment of product that you want to buy, it seems nice to you. But when you actually see the product at the shop, it is not that nice as you were expected and start to complaining. I think this is natural and what you need to do is SEE BEFORE YOU BUY IT. 

If company advertise their products as exactly as it looks, not many people would buy them compare to the situation in the statement.  Because of these reasons, I agree to the opinion that the most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are."
3483,0,"I agree that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.  Having knowledge in a broad number of academic subject not only constitues an all rounded person, but also paves the way for the success in specializing in one specific subject.  

To acquire a truly thorough understanding of a specific subject, the knowledge of that subject alone is not enough.  It is in conjuction with other subjects that gives academics a greater understanding of what they are currently dealing with.  If one only focuses one's studies in a specific subject, their method of thought would only be limited to that particular subject.  For example, a mathematician might only be familiar with the methological deduction of a problem, and hence be unable to understand matters with an imaginative mind.  Should the mathematician develop his mind in different ways, say through art or writing, he might be able to develop mathematics further.  For example, the Klein's bottle, named (not suprisingly) after Klein is a mathematical concept which is not applicable in the real world.  Yet it has been and still is an important mathematical concept and puzzle which forms the bases of further mathematical investigation.  If mathematicians follow a logical and structural line of thought, the Klein's bottle would have never been thought of and mathematics would not be able to further itself.  

Furthermore, take philosophy for example, it has become apparent that to become a successful philosopher, one must acquire skills from various subjects.  Kant and Heidegger amongst other prominent philosophers have had their say on the subject.  They believe in order to become a successful philosopher, one must acquire skills from mathematics and science, an ability or a means to comprehend the world, a method of logical mental training that is crucial to the functioning of a clear-minded philosopher.  

Given the proliferation of  academic institutions that faciliate research and learning in all sorts of areas, each discipline is slowly beginning to exhaust itself in its subject matters.  Also, the technological advancements have lead us to be living in an ever changing environment, resulting in many new inter-disciplinary connections.  For example, even the development of a robot dog takes into account the psychological effects it will have on humans, and creates a more acceptable model.  ( Hence the connection between the engineering and psychology).  With the above two reasons, it is even more crucial that in order to truly succeed at 'specializing' in one subject, not only does on need to delve into the contents of it, but also in other academic subjects.

In conclusion, even if a person wants to specialize in a specific subject or be an all rounded person, it is crucial to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects."
3275,0,"I disagree with the statement ""Young people do not give enough time to helping their communities"".You can find youngsters  doing commuty services at college , at the welfare clubs and anywhere they find themselves needed.

  College is main area of such service centres.They have their own groups there that does works like collecting funds from students for a worthy cause, or conducting any event ,may it be cultural or academic to raise the money for a need . I would like to quote something related to the recent ""tsunami""  attack that killed lives of many. There were casualties and loss of properties and the  poor people who live in coastal regions were badly affected.Our college group ,who wanted to help the victims,raised a  ""Contribute some and  Save them""  event to raise money , and it colleceted a gross amount nearing eighty  thousand . It would be small ,when only one college is considered, But when all the colleges in that area are considered its a substantial sum.Its even amazing how much such events in colleges throughout  the country would have acquired.

  Another instance to quote is the recent ""Blood Donation"" camp that was organised by the youth club in my locality. The event was done with guidance and it was a huge success.People , mainly youngsters - both boys and girls participated whole heartedly.And it surely would save lives .

 Not only at college or residential area, even at our workplace such services occur frequently - may be blood donation camp , may be raising money for a cause , or maybe visiting a hospital or an orphanage .These visits include spending time the children in orphanage and making them smile and  doing cultural perfomances to give them a good time. Or  hospital visit - majorly to help in soothing the patients and hearing their problems.  Both visits end up in donations being made to them.

 These show that youngsters are doing community services very good."
5982,0,"Learning mechanism works in different way person to person. Some people choses to memorise the facts some people choses to learn how the facts can be produced. Learning concepts and ideas are important because; you can remember the facts by the brainstorming about the concepts and ideas, and you can be familiar to learn new facts about a different topic.
	First of all, it must be accepted that, memorising the facts can be a fast way to learn. It can be work in small period of time. You can pass the next examination, for instance. On the other hand, When you forget the fact, it will be very hard to remember if you dont know the ideas belong them and concepts. if you learn the ideas and concepts, you can guess how the fact is provided. So, learning the ideas and concepts can be work on keeping in mind the data for a long time. 
	Furthermore, once you get used to learn how a fact can be provided from an idea, you can easily learn an unfamiliar topic. Every lecture has facts and the ideas' and the relationship between facts and ideas are the same.  Firstly, you will try to understood the ideas. According to the ideas in the concept, you can learn the facts as stable as you provided these facts.  You can use exactly the same method on learning the new lectures.
	As a result, learning the ideas is better than memorising the facts even though it needs larger time to understand. The datas will be more stable and to remember will be easy and learning new topics will be easier than memorising every fact of every lecture."
7427,0,"Ya,i definately agree with this statement.Particularly i believe that ,the sucessful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.In this aspect,a sucessful people mean that ,they already familiar with most of the issues.They mostly concentrate mainly on new inventions or new things to show that or to prove that they are also good in all the subjects or things.That too, the selected thing mostly will have greater risks and fluctuations.But, his/her sucess mainly depends on acheiving the selected thing or goal.
      In my view the sucess in any person hides mainly in selecting the new intersting thing and the way he/she acheives it.Even if he/she fails in trying new thing ,they will be well known that ,the method he/she adopted is a wrong one, and he tries for the another. And i strongly believe that, mostly sucessful person try new things rather what he/she already know how to do it well. Right? If the same known thing happened to do repeatedly,he /she may get sucess in that particular thing only,and he/she connot try a new thing.In this senario,how can one think that he/she is a sucessful person.And i strongly disagree with the statement that, successful people do or attempt old things what they alredy know how to do it well.The sucess in trying new thigs and acheiving them, proves him a more successfull person than before.Getting sucess in new things that are risky proves him/her a lot as a successful person rather in successing the same in a well known thing and which is not risky.
      Let us consider with an example, now we all well aware that ,Thomas Edison has invented Electric bulb.He adopted several experiments in the procee of invention of Electric bulb.Earlier all of his Experiments are failures.But,atlast he succeed in his invention and also learns that all his failures are the wrong methods that shaould"

Going with a tour guide made us learn many things, for example when we visited England we found many statues, parks,trees,trains and rivers. Each one of theses was explained clearly and accurately about its time and place and when did they found it and how long that it will exist, all that was known by the tour guide. we learned many things and we had more experience about this country.

Without going with a tour guide we may get lost. A tour guide is like a north star that guides lost people. Before few years, when we went to visit Australia we thought that we might not need to use a tour guide and because of that we had alot of problems and troubles. We were trying to find a park from evening until night and when we reached there everyone was lost.

In the conclusion, a tour guide is better to use because he guides lost pe"
10135,0,"In the past, young people used to help their parents and their communities. But nowadays it has changed. I agree with the fact that young people nowadays do not give enough time to their communities because of many reasons.

Helping the community is a very important thing to do but nowadays young people do not give enough time to helping their communities.
Firstly, nowadays young people have a lot of activities. They go the college and after that they have homeworks to do. A lot of young people have to find a job during their studies because they don't have enough money to pay them. And after working, young people do not have anought time to do anything else. For example I am doing an European MBA in a management schoolm and to pay ;y studies, I have to work all evenings and all week end. I also have to do my assignments and it's a huge work. 

I think that in the past young people had more time to help their community. They didn't had as many things to do as we do nowadays. I am sure that the problem is the time because young people often want to help their communities but they can't.

To conclude the fact that young people nowadays do not give enough time to their communities is right. Nevertheless they have many things to do and when they can, they like to be helpfull, for their communities or for their parents"
6196,0,"Do you want to live successful life? If you want to make it possible, I think you'd better try new things than old things that are too common and oldfashioned.  In my opinion, most people who live successfully tried new things and took risks. There are two reasons to express my opinion. 
 Firstly, it is true that nomal people do nomal things, live nomal lives and love nomal things. According to speaking of successful people, however, they were willing to take risks to succeed. People should not copy and repeat something because sometimes the something need to be changed. We should create new things that will make us 
live new lives and better lives. 
 Secondly, maybe all of us know 'life is venture'. It is so famouse sentence that  we could hear before. But  the case that it comes true is very rare because people are afraid that they could make a mistake in trying new ventures. But I think avoiding venture to keep them from failling is the worst things in your whole lives. You don't have to be frustrated even though you fail to try something new. It will give you an experience. This envaluable experience will help you to succeed other things. It is so envaluable that you may not want to change to other things. 
 In conclusion, there are a number of opportunities in the world. Some people can see and cach these possiblities, but others can't see that they would miss these things. You have to take these opportunities in your life. In this morden society, it is so important to be a creative person. Society wants that kind of people, so we should have courages and keep going to the new thinsd"
11920,0,"Although some may assert that knowing the facts is the most important thing when studying, I believe that it is much beneficial for students to actually understand the ideas and concepts for their better studies.

To begin, it would be much time-saving for children to grasp the concept before studying the facts of the subject. If they memorize the facts initially and then try to understand the ideas, it would take them more time to obtain all the knowledge in that area. Since people usually forget the facts they memorized, after going through the concepts of the study they are working on. For instance, if I memorize the terms used in water circulation and then try to understand the concept of it, I would have to go over the words again, since I have to fit my knowledge into what I have learned right now. While understanding the ideas in the first place can make me only fit the terms in to what I have already done understanding.

On top of that, it would make the study much easier to know the concepts first. When one understand the thins and then learn the facts related in it, it comes to person's mind in more influential way. The study of math can be a good example. If a child in a kindergarten learns that '1 plus 1 is 2', they would know that '1 plus 1 is 2' but do not actually understand the term of plus. While, if they initially learn what plus actually means, then they would know that '1 plus 1 is 2' and '3 plus 2 is 5' and so on. By understading the idea of something, it leads people to learn in more efficient way.

By grasping the concept of the subject, one can save their time and effort. All in All, I believe that learning ideas and concepts of something in the first place is much benefitable and profitable for the people to actully learn and study a subject."
5801,0,"In these modern times , youth are always bothered about achieving thieir individual goals and fullfiling their needs.They are less bothered about their community .Every youth has to play a certain role in the community.He has to serve for the benefit of the community and future generations.
          Often,Youth  benefit from a  communtiy and when they  achieve their goal or reached a better situation with the aid of the community ,they forget the help rendered to them.For example in developing countires  many students are provided  reservations because they belong to a certain downtrodded community.The students after achieving success are not indebted to the community and dont try to help it.
         But there are some instances where this is not always true . Consider  the case of an  Indian student going  to the United States to pursue higher education.He checks out the memeber's of the Indian community in that college and contacts them before hand.The members of the community then arrange for his transport from the airport to the university campus and then take care of him for two to three days . Since the basic idea of this community is to help other students and in this aspect young people are suceeding.
      There are also several youth who try to help their communities. When a person leaves his country and achieves success ,they do not forget their mother land ,they try to help their native community.Take the case of many Non Resident Indians.These young people  try to help and fund various charity organisations in India.
      So ,though i agree that young peole now a days are not giving enough time to help their communities ,I feel that this is not always true because there are some instances where young people  spend their time and money for the benefit of the  community."
10798,0,"I cannot deny the fact that some advertisements make products seems much better that they really are.  For example, since online shopping is getting more and more common,  sometimes I have to buy things only judging from the information provided by the advertisement, and I received a completely different thing from what I expected from the advertisement. However, consumers are getting smarter, too.  There are many advertisements that shows the real information by various methods. 

There are various types of methods used for advertisement that provide real information. For example, the company provide samples of the products to allow consumers to experience them.  With this method of advertisement , the consumers acutually use the products by themselves, and they can make a decision to buy it or not.  It is a good example to allow the consumers to get the real impression of the products. 

Another example is that some advertisements provide statistical information. The advertiser conducts a marketing research of their own products to show the users' impressions or customer satisfaction.  In this way, the consumers can get the reliable information of what the users actually thought of the products.  

Finally, there are many advertisements that a sales representative actually demonstrate how to use the product. The consumers can ask questions about the product at the site, and the sales person answers information of what the customers really need with showing the products.  Since the customers are actually looking at the product , it is possible for the consumers to get real information. 

As a result, customers know that advertisements have a tendency to promote only their good sides, and companies know that it is not enough only to provide good images. There are many methods of advertisement that allows consumers to obtain useful information that represents the actual products."
7826,0,"In these day, advertisements is the one of  important marketings  in business because it can be the first impression like on a screen of television , for 30 seconds chance can change customers' needs.  I agree that some of advertisements make the product look like the best qulity than real. 
 Primarilly, visual effect is the biggest impact one in  society . 
   Televisoin is common media and most valuable marketing for business. When you watch one commercial on television like vaccumer , they show us that stuff works well and look luxury .  However when you buy it , mostly time we realize that it doesn't work longer as much as we paid  and after use several time , it looks cheap.  Even we knew that the advertisement will not be the true but we believed our eyes through the screen.  This kind of cases , the moment of  commercial , it should look the best product that ever made.  
 Secondary, i am interesting in business so if i sell my products, i will make my idea seems like much better than it was existed.   I want to make them to use my products like good value not srteet one. If they don't seem fantastic , they will never try to buy and use. I think that people have bias before they know better.  Good looking is good impression. This is the marketing of advertisement. 

However , we should be careful about that because when we loose clients , deceived them, you never be succeed . Advertisement is giving a chance to ues to customs and show them their quality and value not just selling them and making money.  Honesty is the best policy . 
 In conclusion, I agree with that most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are.  Advertisements are the creative job and important method for market but  we should remember that whenener looks good should be good qualities."
7608,0,"Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. I disagree with this statement. When the first Nokia portable phone that was compatabile with a camera came out, advertisements all around showed that you could videotape scenes and take snapshots of friends. When people actually bought the product, what they actually saw was a reallity. Another example is when the iPod was released. Everyone was shocked about how a device smaller than a calculator could store more than a thousand songs. When people went and bought it, they saw how it could do it. It is not that most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are, it is about the person that buys the product. Many people when they see advertisments of new electronic devices, they get so happy to see something that new and something that functions in a new way so when they buy the product and use it everyday, they get bored of it. So when the person remembers how the product looked on billboards and newspapers and compares it with him after owning it for two months, he will think that the advertisement made the product seem much better than it really is. The reallity is that the person has been using the product effectivley that lead to him getting bored of it. My opinion is that most advertisments show what the real product is and that they don't exaggerate on the product. Another problem is that many people understand the advertisment wrong. When the person goes to buy the product and the finds out that it doesn't function the way he thought it is, the individual then gets unsatisfied. I think that people should understand the advertisment and what they are trying to say and understanding the message that they are trying to send."
5554,0,"Nowedays, competition between companies is feirce, every one needs  do his best in order to sell his product and survive in the market. and advertisements is a very efficient technique to sell  and be successeful.
    I totally agree that most advertisement make the product look much better than they really are, everything look so wonderful on TV or on a magazine. new technologies are applied to make people and celebities so perfect, bottles of product look bigger and to easy to use and to open.....
    As a result, advertissements are having a big and negative influence on people's life, it is just and endless process of a ""must have"". We always find things that we don't really need, but we buy it anyway just because we saw it on TV last night !  and we end up bu spending hundreds of dollars because we thought it was somthing that we can't live without.
    aAother negative thing that influence adults as well as teenagers is using celebrities to promote a certain product. everyone become obseste and has to have this product. for instance, product for  wrinkles or acne. just because it worked for a calabrity doesn't mean that it would work for you, everyone's skin and hair is different. another example is the clothes. most of celebrities and models are thin and tall, and everyone has a different body shape, so, if those clothes look good on the model it doesn't mean that they would fit you. and the worst thing of all in teenagers watching those commecials, they can starve themselve or be anorexique in order to look like something irealistice, those photos  shown in magazine are fake most of the time, they can make you look taller or thiner.
     In conclusion, I beleive that advertisements are not real most of the time, and the producers exagerate and make things look so much better than what they really are, but companies that never keep their promesses will cost them a lot because they will lose the costumer's trust and will have a bad reputation. advertisement can be efficient and work for the compagnie and make it popular and efficient  if the things shown are real and not just lies and exagerations."
6014,0,"I think that young people enjoy life more than older people do, especilly for those young people which are born in the 1980s in China.
     The logics of consuming has a great difference between the young people and the old people. Nowadays, the young people prefers to the brand products a lot. For instance, one of my roommates likes wearing sports shoes, and he spends nearly 3000 RMB to buy the 3 pairs of Nike shoes a time. 3000RMB means no more than a month's salary for him, but it equals one-year expenses of his old father and mother living in the countryside.
     The young people like traveling far away during their spare time or public holidays,but the old people usually do not go out of city for saving the costs. My colleague has been to Yunan province with his new girl friend during this year's National Holidays, they have been to there for 7 days, cost them about 6000RMB. He also suggest his father and mother go with them. But when these two old people considering the big expense, they tell their son that they only want to climb the mountain nearby.
     The young people usually pan the career by attending a lot of differenting trainings, the spend their money for the excuese of better careers in the future. The old people often save their small money and accumulate by depositing in to the bank, they want to leave this money to their following generations."
1854,0,"Since their first appearance on the market, cars had gone through an outstanding increase concerning their rate of production. It is starting from this idea that I do not agree with the statement. In fact, looking back at history an evident growth of cars production can be seen, together with a rapid development of competition between the cars industries that are also forced to follow people's needs.
	First of all, since their first production during the 1920's ( with Tom Ford), cars have gradually gained an even bigger role in society. Their introduction into people's lives started to completely revolutionize their everyday lives and their standards. People obtained the possibility of moving throughout their country and to become more independent. Since then, cars have become part of our lives, even influencing our deicisions and our plans. It is for this reason that today's cars production has more than doubled its sells and it is still continuing to do so.
	Secondly, I do not agree with the statemetn because competition among industries producing cars is pushing their production to augment instead of decreasing it. In today' s society it is fundamental to invest and make money, therefore competition between industries is reaching really high levels. It is due to this increasing competition and rivalry that cars production is not going to stop and not even to slow down.
	Finally, cars producers are also following people's need in society and, since our requests and needs are increasing and changing as time goes by, the production of cars is following our demands. People from all over the world need such a fundamental mean of transportation in order to travel , work and fullfill their own goals. When industries decide to sell a product, they first refer themselves to society's and people's needs and since cars are even more present and necessary to us, their production is continuing to proceed in a positive way.
	These three points are the reason why I do not agree with the statement. Not only I base myself on historical evidence, but I also analyse the influence people's needs have and the companies' interest in producing something which is worth selling."
877,0,"It's very difficult to state if it is better to have a deep specialization in a certain subject or instead to have a broad but more superficial academic knowledge.  
Reasons for mantaining both positions are several.
	Having a complete knowledge of a subject may bring to a full comprehension of what is under it. It involves understanding causes and consequences of all principles included. For this reason I think this kind of high quality specific culture may be very useful for investigation. Research programs take advantage from people that have specific competences about the research objectives. And it is surely from this people that further developements can come .
	Moreover, I think that a strong competence on a subject may be a great personal satisfaction. Knowing everything about a process or a specific matter would certainly create a deep satisfaction in a person, that in a certain way pays him back of all the efforts made in achieving it.
	On the other hand, I think that a broad culture brings much more satisfaction to whom holds it.
	It may be true that having many competences implies not to have very specific concerns. But I think that knowing a bit of many things allows  to understand better the world we live in. I mainly think that life isn't all inside a research laboratory, nor all in a university. In my opinion, meeting, exchanging impressions and relating with people is one of the most interesting things to do. Having many knowledges allows to stay with everybody, without being exluded  from any group. It is true that in this way any subject will be accademically achieved in a complete way. But the essential things that lacks may be aprehended from others.
	In conclusion, I think that the advantages brought by a deep knowledge of an academic subject are not sufficient to balance the loss of many interests that this achievement would imply. Spending the same amount of time, a person who goes too deep into a subject experiences a loss, due to the many other things he or she could have studied."
3699,0,"I agree with the statement that it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. My reasons for this are three folds.
    Firstly, in my opinion, ideas and facts are broder termsthan facts. Therefore, when a student learns about ideas and concepts she\he may also have the chance to see the facts behind them. However, if a student only learns about a fact, he\she would not be able use this fact when necessary. This would be mainly because of the inability of the student to make this fact concrete in her\his mind because of lack of ideas and concepts related with this fact. 
  Secondly, learning a fact alone would not probably take the attention of the student very much. However, in oder to motivate students to learn more about their fields of studies, the topics of their studies should be interesting. Most probably an interesting lesson would help students to be more willing and more motivated to make further research and investigation about that topic. In that way, understanding ideas and concepts rather than merely learning facts would help students to develop themselves as well.
  Thirdly, to my point of view, understanding ideas and concepts make students more creative. If they undertand ideas and concepts  about a topic\ then they can apply them into their lives. For example, they can develope new theories. which can also make contributions to their fields of studies. Being creative is a very important aspect and of an education system. Due to that reason, understanding ideas and concepts would be critiical in the personal development of a student.
  Ultimately, for all of the reasons I have mentioned above, it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts."
2537,0,"I believe that the degree of stress that a particular person is exposed, or has to be exposed, throughout his or her entire life is very important.  Most of us are not  aware how stress consumes our energy and finally, limits our ability to live in a more relaxed way. I am convinced that stress doesn't contribute in the level of happiness for a person.  I'd say that the more stress a person experiences, the less happiness he or she will feel.  

Happiness is the state of mind that helps a person to enjoy life and it's the emotion that makes us appreciate the things that life has to offer in a more positive manner. 

There are people who consider that young people just do not appreciate life with the importance it has.  Young people just do not pay attention to small details and their way of life goes rather faster in comparison to somebody who has reached certain age. On the top of that, a young person is expected to make major choices that will change him or her for the future, such as finding the proper school and studies, starting a family and other stressful decisions.

On the contrary, some people would claim that is is older people who are experiencing a better way to live theirs lifes.  They do not have to be worried about what most of the people do during their whole life, such as education, professional goals, and so on.  Instead, they live with greater experience and emotional maturity that allow them to be less aprehensive and stressful. 

However, I think that age alone plays no significant role in terms of enjoying life.  I strongly believe that happiness is the result of a number of factors both in the environment and in the personality of a particular person.  Medically speaking, depression can be associated both in young and older people as well as there are people that consider themselves happy regardless of their ages. Finally, I think that we all have the opportunity to enjoy life no matter how old, or young, we are."
1748,0,"I agree with the following statement that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.
                       When a person  wants to learn the facts first he has to have some ideas how he can come to the end point .first of all he has to make clear about the concepts he wants to include to reach that destiny.
                  For example, if we want to do some project to submit  to a professor we have to have some dead time to finish,then we have to concentrate how we can finish that assignment with in the time.first we have to create some ideas like which books we have to refer,how we can present that paper,the order of the paper,we have to show to someone who can give us the some more information that can be included,put the paper in clear format and submit the paper.
               Factual information  may be the true information to learn  that before we have to understand what are the hidden ideas and the concepts.when we  be in a family everyperson tries to reach a fact so easily about others but before going to a conclusion about that person we have to have some idea about his behaviour that is how he talks,how he moves,how he behaves with in the house,then we have make a concept about that person then atlast give the facts about that person.
                      I conclude my passage by saying that every person,for example student should create an idea about which graduation he wants to complete and what courses he is intrested  and prepare a concept that what is required for him to complete the graduation.take some suggestions ,know how difficult it is and then enter in to fact that he wants to end up with that certification of graduation in which he is intrested with joy."
4129,0,"Today the society gives more input and opportunities to every young and older people.
The young people have more possibilities for to live a enjoy life, for example they use more fast the computer and the new thecnologies, the have more free time because the school or university, if they are beeing to schedule, are the only problems for the boys. Another points is fot their are the enought of important life question to think (family, home, tax, job, ect...). Only problem for the young people are the money!
The parties with friends, the trips in everywhere, the discos, the first love, the best friends and the time that you spend wit us, they are example of what the boys enjoy in this time.
For the older people should be different, but today the aspect of vision is more different: usually the older people have much free time when they finish the job, so they can live a more enjoy life. Only problem is the health and the money as the young people, that's not combination!
Infact if the young boys have a disco today, for the older people have a particular disco where is plays old music of 30 or 40 years ago. The most important aspect is the companies that this people have around their. To have a friends (male or female) give a possibility of out with him and to go to enjoy ever if the boy is only. The important is not to be only.
The age is a relativity aspect that is different each other, a good life is a enjoy life in respect to other.
I think that it is possible enjoy to every age if a people want and have a good companies."
85,0,"Advertisements are born to sell a product and, in order to this, to invite people to buy something. Of couse they need to be actractive for the public and obviously they look better than they are. Personally, I will never spend my money for a good that is represented in a way I don't like, for example if it doesn't seem beautiful to my eyes. 
particularly, if there are more types of the same product, I'm going to prefer the one that in the advertisment looks better, even if I know it lacks in quality. the most significant thing for a lot of people is only appearance. another important aspect of advertisments is that they have to catch the attension of an as great as possible number of people, in the middle of thousands of similar advertisments.
moreover, the greatest part of people doesn't have or, better, doesn't want to waste his time in controlling the real usefullness of a product and so they have to trust in what advertisment tells.
so it's obvious advertisments make poducts seem better than they realy are, it's their ""job"".
although this, advertisments haven't the right to do disinformation about a good. they can't deforme the reality beyond a certain line, because this could be dangerous even for the advertise itself. as said before, people have to trust in advertisments, but if this fail this aim more than one time, people will change kind of product, choosing to listento another advertisements.
it's  a matter of trust, but above all it's a matter of money. even if it's not very correct to behave like this, it's natural in a world of buisness."
11174,0,"From my point of view, human life is so complex that the only way to learn valuable aspects is by trying events that we had never tried before. 
For instance, an engineer may be a genius in developing complicated mobile phone services, but these services may not appeal to most of the people. So what he or she should do is concentrate on completely different subjects such as people's needs and habits. Probably, he or she has never studied anything related to this, but the only way to obtain success is by trying.
Let's see another example. If we worked for Microsoft and we would simply expect to earn money for the current version of Windows, Other company may create a powerfull operating system that would gradually substitute Windows. That's why we would have to invest an enormous amount of money on a new operating system. If we don't do it well the company will eventually disappear but if we don't do anything it's much more likely to disappear. Nowadays there is much more competitiveness than what it used to be.
Obviously, these measures are always taken after many hours of debate and requiere the support of many workers. But the point is that if we do not convince ourselves that we have to innovate, then other people will innovate for us and they will be successful but not us."
77,0,"I agree that to have broad knowlege of many academic is better than to specialize in one specific subject. I have two reason why I agree this opinion: the goal of education and feature of modern society.

First of all, the goal of education makes a good person who is adapted the society. To make a good person, the school teaches many academic subjects. Because the person must study the many academic subjects, he would be adapted the society. For example, two high schools in Korea had another curiculums. The one had  many academic subject in curiculum, and the other high school had a one specifiec subject in curiculum. Which high school's students were succeeded? Answer is the former.

Also, the modern society wants to multipalyer who performs various tasks. As one might expected, to specilize in one specific skill is better than to have broad skill of various field. However, this society make a multiplayer. In my experience, I work my company which has many tasks. Because I don't have no various academic knowledge , I can not promote the manger first time. 

 It is commly belived that to specilize in specific subject is better than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. But, this opnion is not available nowadays. To know many things is allowed to victory the competitions."
4876,0,"I srongly agree with the statement that  most advertisements make products seem much better then they really are because i think  in some cases this is the basic purpose of the advertisements .There are several examples to justify this statement. 
  Firstly take the example of Shampoos, now a days everybody has the problem of less hair and falling hair. In the market you can find a large number of shampoos that will help you in reducing the problem . In that case the advertisements will  gave you the idea of which shampoo you should buy. A well directed advertisement in which a girl is having less hair started using the product X regained  hair  by using it for say 14 days , this kind of advertisement will provoke you to buy the same product but the reality behind it may be different. Only after using it you will came across the actuality. The advertisements main aim is to attract more and more customers and it does not to give the real information all the times. Its the case  in most type of cosmetics too.
  Second take the example of  Yogurts, or any other food products, if you see any  thing in the advertisement then you will surely try to buy the same thing because you would be curious of know whether the product does the same as shown in the advertisement, but my personal experience suggests that the advertisements are the ostentacious  presentation in  case of most of the things. They are not  what they look in advertisements. 
  Finally i  believe that if you take the example of politicians you will find that in order to grab maximum votes they present themselves to be most promising among all others, nobody will show himself as a demagogue,So basically the purpose of advertisement is to make everything look perfect which could be far behind the reality.
  To sum up I can say that in most of the cases the real purpose of the advertisement is to make product looks good , beneficial and worth buying."
190,0,"In twenty years I surely think there would be a considerable fall in the number of cars into use. Following are the reasons I would attribute to this reduction.

The ever growing population and limitless migration to the city is putting tremendous pressure on the available space in cities to construct roads. In twenty years from now the lifestyles of people would become faster and they would like to maintain punctuality. With regular road service, if they opt, the inevitable traffic jams would delay them. Take for example a city like New York or Mumbai, most of the people use local transport i.e. trains to reach offices in the rush hours as there is less possibility of getting delayed. Also with growing population most of the space would be used for domestic purposes, giving less space for the automobiles to be driven or parked. 

Another alarming feature supporting the lesser use of cars would be pollution control. As we are all aware of the increasing EURO III & EURO IV norms, time is not far when the need to reduce the vehicles and hence the emission becomes inevitable specially in cities like New Delhi where the pollution has already reached alarming values. If the people use a common transport, number of ""smoke emitters"" will reduce and so will the pollution levels of city.

With depeleting reserves of petrol and not so advaced and promised solar energy operated cars, the future of gasoline cars would be a mere junk yard. Statistics show petrol reserves of only another 40-50 years which will certainly discourage the usage of petrol operated vehicles. Even if a newer technology is introduced into market to run cars, the equipment cost would be high and will fail to attract customers.

A pleasing factor in discouraging the usage of cars would be cost effectiveness. A fact states that, in a country like USA, the cost to maintain a car equals its price. Public transport would be  much cheaper to afford on long term basis, with no worries to maintain car or buy petrol. A rough estimate about the percentage a middle class family spends on buying and maintaining cars in India is about 40%.  With this money saved, the family could explore new ventures, more productive ones to spend its hard earned money on, eg. better education of their children. 

Summing up, cars in future would be replaced by extensive public transport network which would comprise of trains, trams and metros with numerous advantages as envisaged."

Many people of successful in business have a goal like bid dream.
Because of that they knew how exciting when got tha goal from before success. Therefore, they need to feel more exciting and advanture things. There are two examples why they need more and what they have differ than others who is not successful person.
    First of all, they have more confidence about everything. Because they have many experience than others. Beside they have pride also. Therefore, they really want to win in business in other hand they rearlly hate lose from somebody. This is morovating them to try and try. 
   Second, they realized this "" no pain no gain"" therefore, they can accept many kind of risks to get their business like more money.
There are no money and no success without risk and danger.
They knew this fact, it makes success them in society.
  In conculsion, successful people try new thing and take risks due to get more success and money."

In my oppinion every activity which helps people to have a good day or some nice moments count. For example helping at a sports event or babysitt the kids of your neighbor, is also a good thing. With this you help your neighbohrs to have some time off and enjoy there own interests. Nowadays many young people have a lot of different hobbies. So they are involved in other things and does not want to cut their spearetime down. They are not so motivated like some years ago. You can see this by different organisations, they lake for students to help them. A other point is the money. It is not sure that they earn some money for their help, but money got so important for young people. Why should they help other people and offer their time and get nothing than a smile? These things does not count so much. I am pretty sure most young people would have the time to help but they are not interessed. You could get back so much, if you help others. If the parents would help  in the community by themself it would be a motivation for some children to do it too. Mostly I agree with the statement, but there are still some individuals outside, which do there best. They offer their time and are not interested in money. I know some people who tryed to get money to help children. So that they had the possibility to buy toys. I baysitted at various events, so that the parents could enjoy their time and had not to worry about their chil"

Of course when you watch  television a lot of infomations and pictures goes in your brain. You record all you have seen and after you want to buy it it's a fact. But when you go in a restaurent for exemple sometimes you are very desapointed because it doesn't look at all with what you've seen on television. The producers are really strong because they can make an illusion of lot a things and the people fall in this illusion. I have a personal exemple for this situation. Last nignt i was watching television and i saw an advertisement about the newest cell phone. The commercial said that he is very small, one the most resistant... in fact one of the most everything. When i went in the cell phone shop indicated on the advertisement i discover that the phone was very big that he wasn't at all resistant and in fact that he was very bad. I understood after that it was only a commercial witch make me go to the cell phone store to buy an another phone. I got punked by this wrong advertisements. And i don't think i am the only one who leave this experience in fact i believe that everyday people like me do the same thing but some people sometimes doesn't go back like me and on the contrary enter in this vicious circle. it's the purpose of those commercial. It's to send you somewhere to make you buy something you didn't need at first. But whe cant always said that the commercial are trying to play with us. Sometimes the commercials are true and show us true things. They don't play this game often ( make product seem much better tan they really are) because in this case a lot of person will be sent to jail !"
11723,0,"Young people have future. I agree this statement. Now I am a person who is thought young  people. I enjoy my life now.  May be I will have some problems in the future. These troubles will cause difficluty that I can enjoy the life. Now a days many older people have these problems. On the other hand, young peole have a long future. Most of them will live longer than older people, so they can plan many things what they are going to do in the future. This is also means that If they have a trouble, they have enough time to solve it. For example health problem and finance problem.  
	At  first, ususally young people are healther than older people. Helth problem is seriou and it aboid happy life. In my experonence, my grandmather always suffer from her disease. Because of this disease, it is hard for her to walk aroud her house. She can not go to shop to buy food. Unfortunetly, recently sometimes she can not go to toillet on her own abilliy. She always says that she wishs, she can go back her young days. Many Japanese old people say that how your health is when they met some old person.
	The second, older people can not work, so they have to consider about their finance. They have to manage the money. It is stress for them. However young people can work well, because they are fine. they do not have to care about it. Also It is easy for them tothem to rend money.
	In conclusion, I do not have a serious problem that she older people have now, but I will have soon. What should do is not only enjoying this life but also prepare for the future. Therefore, I suppose this statement is true."
5864,0,"Nowadays, there are evolving interesting discussions pertaining to whether young people do give enough time to help their communities or not. In this connection, and based upon my experience as undergraduate and graduate student at The American University in Cairo (AUC), I would state that it is my belief that young people are actually devoting enough time to develop and make life better in their small and large communities.

	First, I would provide express examples of how AUCians have invested efforts to support their small living community, that is AUC. In this regard, it is worth noting that prior to start of the new academic year, AUCians usually gather in organized groups that tend to make orientation to the new freshmans. Usually, there are groups that cover wide spectrum of services that include orientation to the AUC campus including classes, labs, library, and departments. Also, these groups introduce the new students to the university catalogue and related matters such as advising, course registeration, and requirements for joining any specific major. Moreover, the same groups make the new students familiar with the various extra corricular activities that are available on campus. Another aspect of devotion of young AUCians are devoted to their small community is that they join certain groups that target alumni and other sponsors in order to provide adequate funding for many of the activities that are arranged at AUC.  In this way, it is evident that how the young AUCians prove to be effective in serving their small community.

	On the other hand, and as far as AUCians services for their large community are concerned, it will be essential to highlight the role of the different clubs at AUC. AUC hosts many clubs that are fully operated through young students and aim at making life better in Egypt. There are many clubs that include, inter alia, help club, cancer club, and hand in hand club. The help club is a club that aims at providing the poor people in Egypt with better living conditions. This is attained via gathering donations from AUC young students and using the same to buy food, clothes, homes, and shelter for the poor people. Furthermore, the cancer club concentrates its efforts on collecting donations to support patients of cancer in their tough struggle with this severe disease. Along the same line, the hand in hand club aims at visiting elder people who are hosted in various elder houses. During these visits members of the hand in hand club tend to provide the said elders with their needs and try to draw a smile on their faces as a simple reciprocation for the sincere efforts in their youth. Accordingly, it goes beyound doubt that the young students at AUC play a vital role in serving their large community.

	In light of the above, and based on life examples of the young students at AUC, it can be concluded that young students have feel their belonging beleonging to their societies. Thus, they have enthusiasm and dedication to help and serve their communities."
3152,0,"It is realy difficult to say broadly that it is the best to travel in a group led by a tour guide, or to plan for your tour yourself. There are several factors contributing in making an opinion. If I am travelling to a new place that I did not visit before and have no experience or knowledge about its best places, timing, sight tours, historical places and recreational locations, then, of course, having it professionally arranged by a tourism company and being led by a guide will be the best option. This will save time and effort and in the same time will provide the best to see and to do in the place I am visiting. The trip will be professionally preplanned and I don't have to worry about transportation or gathering information or going into the hassle of the unknown or unexpected.  Another good point is being a member in a tour group will give me an excellent opportunity to get in touch with other people from different backgrounds and be acquainted with other cultures. It is a golden chance to make new friendship relations and enjoy talking to people out of the usual circle of persons in my ordinary daily life.
On the other hand, if I am travelling with my family or with a group of close friends and I know the place or country I am addressing, then I would prefer to go on my own in such trip. Having visited that place, probably more than one time, means that I have the sufficient experience and knowledge as regards where to go, what to see or visit, and when to do this or that in the proposed program. In this case I may be the personal guide to my companions! I do prefer this last option in case I am travelling with my family to a place I know very well. It saves me money and gives me and my familiy the advantage of flexibility in planning and in keeping privacy. It also gives us the opportunity to strengthen or family bonds and enriches  our relation to each other without being tied or perplexed with obligations to the rest of the tour group."
5964,0,"Personnaly I do not think that young people enjoy life more than older people. Indeed, of course these two different kind of people express theire life enjoying differently.

I think young people, are more able to do physicals things, like going to parties, going to pubs or playing. Things which are interpreted by any body as life enjoying signs. But I also think that older people have more responsabilities, less time and theire conception of enjoying is different, they try to make everything pleasant and not only some pieces of time from theire life like youngers. I mean, older people try more to decrease the number of bad things in theire life  while youngers, on an opposite way, try to increase the number of fun things but these two technics have the same aim.

The question is indeed a question of point of view. Indeed, I think young people enjoy the present time, what they are doing now while older people enjoy the result of what they accomplished. I think that youngs look like more life enjoying but just because they show it easier to the others."

 But as a matter of fact and as the world is getting flattened i think that people of the third world will learn from other nations how to get organized and establish a well,advanced infrastructure in the field of trasportations,as they act as an obstacle for decreasing the number of cars in my openion.
 As we see in cevelized countries all classes of society even the wealthy people uses public transportation because its well organized and the people are well educated about the polution issues and they not only but acts about it, but on the other hand we see how in the third world people brag about there 18 years old kid has his own car.
  But thanks to evolution in every aspect of life, people are learning from eash other and as petrolium is getting higher in prices , nations are getting advices from eash other on how tosave energy an making a verey advanced transportaions like busses and trains.
for an example i used to reach a certain place which is away from home 5 min. by the car in 35 min when i take the bus due to lalk of organization but now after five years it improved to ake me 10min which is acceptable.

 Anyhow i am optimistic about a future with less cars and the key to that is by well educating the people about the problems being encountered by the increasing number of cars, and to offer them a convenient substitution."
2435,0,"I believe that is better to have a strong knowledge about a specific subject, rather than a superficial and wide one of lots of academics themes.
I'm going to explain my reasons using a personal example: my academic choice.
In Italy there are two types of Universities: 
- One type is for the students that  have a clear idea of what they want to do in their lives. If you study Medicine, that means that you want to become a doctor; if you study Law, it means that you want to become a lawyer;
- The other is for the people who doesn't know exactly, or at all, what to do. For example, Science of Communication gives you broad knowledge about many subjects: literature, psychology, business, art etc..., but doesn't prepare you for anything in particular. 
I chose to study Public Relations, which is very similar to Science of Communication, because I didn't know exacly what I wanted to become. Well, at the end of my carreer, after my graduation I asked  myself: ''And now?"" I realized that having lots of knowledge about nothing is absolutely useless. I had many interviewed, but I didn't exacly know what I wanted from that job. The truth is that I didn't know anything specific.
This is why I decided to force me to understand what I really wanted to do, and, once I realized that I wanted to work in Events, I applied for a Master, that would've gave me all the knowledge and the competence I needed to face the real world. 
I think that all the high schools should help more the students to understand which is the best job for them, not to make the mistake that lots of people do: attending a University random, that gives general knowledge, but nothing concrete."
6683,0,"The statement contents that in twenty years the number of cars in use will decline. I do not agree with the claim. According to me, the number of cars will continue to increase thouh there might be a change in the technology which they use.

As the population continues to grow, so are the needs. And, car is emerging as a basic need of the world today. Technological advances have made the dream of a common man, to own a personal car, true. The rates of the car have never been so low, and this sharp decline of prices will continue as the technology progresses. This would further encourage their sale in the near future, as more and more people will be able to afford one.

In earlier times, cars were meant only for the main member of the family, the earning heads. While today, even children and other family members use cars for their personal needs. 

Moreover, nowadays, the two-seater sedans are in vogue. This means that if a family of four members use a single car today, they may go on to use two 2-seaters in future. 

Futhermore, the other modes of conveyance like the buses or the three wheelers generally cause more pollution than that generated by the cars. Nowadays, cars have been manufactured which use electricity or solar energy to run. The availibility of such cars at affordable prices will help, to some extent, check the, so called, never-ending pollution problem, and hence will be supported by the government of any nation.

However, the increase in the number of cars will accelerate the problem of traffic.

Thus, I strongly feel that in future, the number of cars being used will continue to rise and so will the problem of traffic, but with a decline in the pollution."
1422,0,"In my opinion successful people are more related in trying new things but they are not necessarily more atraccted in taking risks.
The reason for my thought is that people who are successful normaly lead a company or are the owner of some kind of business. 
Therefore they have responsibility for many employees who are working in the firm. 
For example when the boss of a company wants to develop a new, lets say, a new car. The car works with a new technology which is much better for the environment but is not tested good yet and will probably not make much money. In my opinion the business leader should not take the risk to develop the car until it has been well known in a country and has reached high interest. Because if it does not work and nobody will buy the car the company will eventually be lost and the employees would be unemployed.
Nevertheless I think that successfull people are more willing to try new things. They probably develop new things and also give impulses for future. That means that they are pre- thinkers of future ideas. 
In spite of my opinion I could imagine that there are successful people who take risks. These people normally are very self-confident and assure of themselves because they do not care of the people who depend on their decisions. 
Another topic to talk is the possibility to take risks in there free time, like a hobby. When something worse happens they will just be risponsable for themselves, expect they have children and wife.
In conclusion I would say that successfull people tend to be more risk loving than others but they should be aware of their responsibility."
9003,0,"This question perfectly fits with my personal experience, in fact I had to face to this important question during my career as a student before and a worker after.
At university I have studied political science, a faculty which gave me a wide knowledge other different subjects, such as politic, history, economy, languages, sociology, philosophy, mathematic,law, etc. During the period of my studies I have found them really usefull and not boring at all, because I could study different issues at the same time, making university a vary and always new method of learning. The same day I had lessons of private law, mathematic and sociology, and this variety of subjects avoided the risk of getting tired of studing always the same thing.
Then I graduated, and I had to face the incredible world of job.
And only at this point I have found out that all what I had studied at university gave me on one side a wide range of knowledges, but on the other a lack in the specific knowledge of one main subject. 
In all this, which knowledge is better? The broad knowledge of many academic subjects or the specialization in one specific subject?
I still have to find myself the right answer, so that I have to arrange this lack giving a compromising answer: it's better to have a specialized knowledge in one subject which we like and on which we can focus our job and career, but we should optimize this specialization by widening as much as possible our basic knowledge of different subjects. 
Another important factor concerns our goals: if our goal is to find a good and well retributed job, so we have to specialize in one subject because this is what is more needed and asked in the job's world. Nowadays there are more graduated with a good wide knoledge than graduated with a good specialization in one field of studies.
On the other hand, if our goal is to have a general knowledge other different aspects which may help to understand one single sector of our life, such as for istance political science, we have to spend years other different academic subjects, studying a bit of everything."
5717,0,"I agress that it is more important for students to understand idras and concepts than itis for them to learn facts. 
 First, If students can understand ideas and concepts, they will utilize them. Understanding them make students more better. For example, students understanding them can make thier opinion useful. 
 In addition to, understanding ideas and concepts is more eassier than learning facts. Because, If students were able to understand them, maybe, They cannot forget them. But learning is not.  
 Secondly, To larn facts is difficult. For example, if students try to remember facts, they might spend more time than understanding the ideas and concepts. We should save our life's time.
If students learn facts, they might forget them. This is poor activies.   
 Third, learning facts is not cheeper than understanding ideas and concepts. If we try to learn facts we pay the fees. And if we choose to understand ideas and concepts, we can understand alone. For example we can read books. Reading books is useful in understanding ideas and concepts. 
  Learning facts is unuseful ways to gain knowleges. we should gain knowleges. So, we can get a job. Getting jobs is very difficult. The world economic is unclearly because of high oil prices, weaken dolloar and so on.   
 Therefore, possibly, I recommend understanding ideas and concepts. If I could back to the past, I would understand ideas and concepts. I never could learn facts. Because I do not have little time. Time is money. 
 Remember my word. so your children will be happy."
8602,0,"Some people think that young people enjoy life more than older people do. On the ather hand , other people think it is not always true. I agree with formar idea. I will describe some reasons from my experience in this essay.
First of all, young people have a lot of vitality. So they can enjoy something such a sports or study as possible as they can. For example, now I go to the art school and study hard everyday. My school always put students some assainment. The quantiteis of the assaiment is so large that I often do them all over the night to finish then. I can continue to study becouse Iike art.
second, I think young people have many oppotunities to find new one such a new friends or new world. In my case , I went to the school of Tokyo by leaving to my home town. In the school , there are many students who have defferent backgroud. To communicat them, my range of thinking is more bigger ever before. For example, talking with a person who have a defferent thinking towoad the art is very exaiting. 
For these reasons I belive that young people is more enjoy their life. Youthful is great."
7878,0,"In our modern society cars are used a lot and most of the people can't manage to live without them. I, however, agree with the statement and believe that cars will be less used in twenty years than they are today.
	
	On one hand it could be inferred that the number of cars will increase, because we have a very big car market nowadays. More beautiful and technological cars are offered every day and the people are drawn to buy them. Furthermore, also young people are encouraged to buy them because this way they can feel independent and free.

	On the other hand, however, cars are beeing replaced more and more often by other means of transportation such as bycicles and motobycicles. In my native country, Italy, cities are becoming very crowded and it is inconvinient to use a car, because of the traffic and the difficulty of finding a parking place. Therefore people try to avoid picking up the car in the morning and prefer to use other means. There are a lot of transport services offered for people nowadays, even for those who live or work far away. Metros, busus and trains are often used also because it costs less than buying a car.

	Even though, the market tempts us to buy cars advertising and promoting them in the most various ways, I believe that there will be fewer cars in twenty years than nowadays. In fact, I noticed that the means of transportation and communication are getting better day by day, encouraging people not to use the car. It would be only a waste of time and money. Additionally, people are becoming more sensitive in what concerns our environment: driving a car pollutes the air and ruins the place we are living in."
4539,0,"As Einstein said ""Imagination is more important than the knowledge"". People can learn the facts at any stages of their lives, however for one to understand the ideas and concepts during education years is crucial. By grasping the ideas and concepts, students can broaden their horizons and their vision of life.

A brain of a student can be best shaped during his/her youth. If a student is able to learn about ideas and concepts during his youth, he can compare them and do not let himself to be a part of bigotry. By knowing the flaws and superiorities of each idea or concept, he can not confine himself only one idea. He will be able to develop  the tolerance against different views . Without knowing one thing, person can not assess it. Therefore students should focus on the ideas and concepts during education years in order to broaden their minds and visions. 

A student without a knowledge about the ideas can not develop his own way of life. By only learning the facts of the life, a person can only succeed to lead an ordinary life. Ideas are like diamonds flashing in the brains. Without an idea, there is no use to have university diploma. As people on the street know very well the fact of the life, there must be a difference between the educated person's mind and mind of someone who does bodily work.


A student who has thorough knowledge of the ideas can always learn about the facts of the life, when he gets into the working life after graduation. But the difference lies in the fact that  this student could have an ability to interpret the facts in a more logical way by employing his already gained knowledge of the ideas.

Wasting the most fruitfull years of one's life, i.e. education years to learn about the facts will be a big loss for a society. To show how much importance is given to the young people can only be possible by equipping them with the ideas and concepts that they will utilize in the further stages of their lives while interpreting and reacting to facts of the life. By this way they can contribute to the future of a country."
4063,0,"The best way of travel is in a group led by a tour guide. Some poeple think like that, and other onces think that is better travel with a group of poeple but without a tour guide. I am agree with the first statement by some reasons.

First, you may have a good schedule of fun activities. If you like to travel and if you are an organized person, you will like to have an  schedule with all your activities, and also someone who show you the bests parts of the city, explain their history, the good  and bad things, the meaning of the place, etc. By following a schedule you may have all your time planned, and you can have the opportunity of visit a lot of parts.

In a second point, traveling in a group is very fun. If you do not know any poeple, is a good opportunity to meet some friends, share experiences, know poeple of different parts of the world, understand different cultures and also you can practice a foreign language.

Finally, and no less important, you can save a lot of money by traveling in a group led by a tour guide. All poeple know that travel on this times is very expensive, and if you travel in group, you will have some very good advantages like saving money in the hotel, or in your transportation. So if you save money, you have the possibility of travel two or three times in a year, and that is really fantastic.

Like a conslusion, I can say that all poeple or the most of the poeple love to travel around the world. Is very excited to think on having the opportunity of visit a lot of cities, meeting poeple of different cultures, even learn about history, and of course saving money. That is why I think that the best way of travel is in group led by a tour guide."
6287,0,"Knowledge is the basic root of humanity development.It's the foundation of any developed country.Knowledge can be gained from plenty sources.It could be wether from the internet,text books,researches or even from mass-media.But the point is which knowledge you intend to aquire.In which field you want to develop yourself.There are two kind of people when it comes to aquiring knowledge,The first one is prefer to be a wide knowledge man having a background in many fields,The second one prefer to be a professional one in his career.In my opinion and from my experience i think it's better to be a professional in a specific career rather than normal in many fields.
        High rate of life and with the variety of information and cultures proposed through television and satellite.The person may feel that he got lost inside all of that.Knowing many information in many fields will make you lost inside them.consequently,you will not be a professional in your career.for example,am studying civil engineering,specifically in steel structure department and i think am a successfull man in doing my job and intending to get master's degree which will provide better life for me later by having a better job with higher salary.while being a person have a shallow background in many fields will not lead me to a better life.
       'Best one among hundreds will take the seat'.That's mean that you have to fight in this time of life.You have to fight to find a job willing for a better life.Having a job these days is so hard.So you have to improve your skills.You have to be a unique in order to get a respectable job,high salary ones.while being a broad knowledge man will not lead you to the point that life needs nowadays.Once i heard a real story from a friend about finding a job in a multinational company.He told me that he went for an interview and surprisingly he found about one hundred and twenty person want to admitt for that job that will only choose one among them.i think that's enough to make me prefer to be a unique and professional man rather than being a  broad knowledge one.
      Nothing is perfect.Everything has it's advantages and disadvantages.But we have to focus on what we need and what the life want from us.Life is a good place if you come up with it's needs.To be a wide range knowledge person will probably help you in many situation you face each day.unfortunately,it's not the good time for that.Life is narrowing your future path in one direction.Which will definitly lead you to a better life and  success in your career ."
4936,0,"Tour guides are profesional people who help foreigners to understand and know everything about a country, this implies the country's history and it's landscape. Sometimes, there are debates dealing with the best way to travel, wheter if it's traveling in a group led by a tour guide or not. We we will explain the benefits of traveling in a group led by one, the inconvenients of traveling without one, and we will conclude giving an agreement or disagreement of this traveling way.
 First of all, traveling with tour guides represents the opportunity, not only to visit a county, but to get information about the country's history and whats more, the country's popular places to visit. Indeed, a tour guide can give aditional information to visitors if they don not have even visited that country. In fact, tour guides can be really helpful for bewildered people, guides can help them take a decision.
On the other hand, tour guides can limit someone's liberty, people traveling in a group led by a tour guide are asked to remain with the group.Thus people can not go wherever they want at any time they want. Besides, it is interesting sometimes to discover a country by getting lost or by talking to people, living among them for a while, more than getting an image proposed by a tour guide. In fact, tour guides might be influenced by their own likings or dislikings so visitors will be actually suggested, and have influenced decisions.
 To conclude, I disagree traveling in a group led by a tour guide to an extent. I think that if it is the first time a tourist visit a foreign country, it is better to travel in a group led by a tour guide in order to get some information about the country so they could travel there again knowing something about the country, but this time without a tour guide, so tourists could leave some events to chance, discover the country, and live with people who live there.Besides, traveling without a tour guide, can help making new friends because travelers will be no longer imposed to do something."
11335,0,"The question about whether it is better to have a broad knowledge or to be specialized is very controversial. One may argue that it is preferable to be familiar with as many subjects as possible, since this will lead to be better suited to different situations . On the other hand, there is the claim that since human knowledge is so broad that it is not only impossible but unpratical to avoid specialization. As a final position, I'll argue why nowdays its better to specialized. In paticular, I will illustrate this by explaining the situation of nowdays mathematicians.
   First I would like to explain why to have a meaninful broad knowledge is almost impossible. By meaninful knowledge, I understand an amount suited to do reasearch on a specific subject or make contributions to it. Just considering the especific case of mathematics, nowdays it has become so broad that even a Master thesis may be hardly understood by people not specialized in the subject. So if someone is not specialized in any field, there are chances that he will not understand the state of the art of the mathematical sciences. Even, there is people who tries to specialized in every possible fields, and what generally happends is that the person becomes a very good lecturer but a poor researcher. My point is that mathematics is too broad to avoid specialization. So the aim of obtaining a broad mathematical knowledge will lead to someone that would hardly be able to excel as a researcher.
     This leads to my second argument. Nowdays an academic person is many times measured based on the amount of original results he produces. That means that not only the person is required to be on the edge of our knowledge, but aquainted enough with it so that to understand how to and be able to expand it.  So in order to obtain a possition as a researcher is better for him to be specialized. And as a matter of fact, only a researcher can aim for a trully broad knowledge in a particular science.
      As a conclusion, given the fact that it is impossible to have and unpractical to aim for a broad knowledge in mathematics, it is even less desirable in general."

So what this does is ,it promotes and drives the student to grow as an individual intellectually.
Now consider the case that the student is given all the facts.He will have all the knowledge that he needs to solve a particular problem or he will have all the answers to any question that is thrown at him. Since he has learnt these facts , its easier for him to recall them whenever he needs to.
This is where the comparasion of the two practices is required to ultimately determine which is more desirable or which one is more beneficial to the student.While knowing all the facts can be considered an asset,not knowing how and where to use them to achieve the desired goal, means that all the factual knowledge is  wasted. In such cases the understanding of ideas and concepts is more beneficial as the student will know how to use the information he has or can comprehend from a given situation or example and still come up with a solution.
For example i am taught in a phychology class that an individual when scared, acts in a particular way, i will learn that as a fact and the way i need to respond to that will also be learnt. Now suppose the person for some reason ,choses to act differently and takes me by surprise, since a response for this has not been learnt. So every fact is not useful, the understanding of the concepts of behaviour in this kind of a situation is more advantageous and can help effectively deal with such a situation.
So i feel it is more important for a student to understand rather than learn everything he can because things learnt may be forgotten but if the student still has his concepts right, he can still deal with anything."
6076,0,"Haven't you ever wondered why the laundry we see on TV is always perfectly clean after washing but we still find some stains when we wash at home? This essay will discuss the issue that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.
Firstly, the product is always in a perfetct light when we see it in an advertisement. Obviously, the producing firm does not want to show the product under worse circumstances. They want to sell the product in order to gain some profits. Therefore it seems reasonable to me to show it in a rather perfect light. For instance, if someone drives a car in an advertisements he drives the car through a picturesque landscape. But we often face noisy traffic jam in dirty cities. Obviously the actor in the add seems to have more fun driving the car. Furthermore, the adds are often supported by music to stimulate the consumers desire to obtain the product. The sound of beautiful music also supports that the product looks better than it looks the noisy real life.  Moreover, the actors in the advertisements are always happy and they really know how to use the product. Sometimes we experiance some difficulties by using a product simply because we do not know how to use it proberly. Imagine a new cellphone. There are so many functions, we sipmly do not know how to handle it with all its possible features. 
To conclude, I agree that the products seem better that they really are because in our daily life we are not using them under the perfect circumstances. But as far as I am concerned, this is no problem as long the basic statement of an advertisement is true and if we are aware of the fact that our daily life differs from the one we see on TV."
11545,0,"Nowadays, quite a few students pay attention to understand ideas and concepts in the subjects. Other students, However focus on the facts. As far as I am concerned, I believed that it is more important and necessary for students to understand and master ideas and concepts that they learned. Among those countless factors, there are three conspicuous aspects as follows.

The main reason that students should understand ideas and concepts is that ideas and concepts are the basic for the subjects. Only do students master the ideas and concepts, they could completely understand the facts. For a example, when we understand the Newton Law, we could explain many facts that occur around us. We know why the water would drop down and apples would fall to the ground when they are in ripe.

Another reason can be seen that student could learn and study deeply after they get to know the ideas and concepts. Students might learn more knowledges by themselves concerning to the subject. Because they grasp essential ideas and concepts. It is important for students that they could learn more knowledge and explain the reason that might difficult to understand from the surface.

Furthermore, some facts are temporary and not forever. Without understand the ideas and concepts, it is really difficult to know the truth. Such as acid rain, which is partially caused by increasing industries. Since we know the truth of the acid rain, people could try to control and eliminate the waste gas given from the manufactories. 
In conclusion, although some facts are easy to learn, it is not solution to learn the knowledge. When students understand the ideas and concepts, they not only could master the truth of the knowledge, but also help them to gain more ability to learn deeply. In addition, after students understand the ideas and concepts, they might know how to take action to resolve the problems."
4977,0,"there are many types of teaching style in school. Some teachers emphasize to understand idea and concepts, but others emphasize just fact and result. Both of teaching styles might have adventages. However, I think the statement that unerstanding idea and concept is more important than learning facts. Before we know a result, we have to know procedure, and we have to understand ideas and concepts to know procedure. 
 In Korea, they emphassize fact and result. we just learn how to approch the facts and results. we don't know why some facts do that.
we just know the facts. We just memorize the fact. For example, when I learned about multipling, I just memorize the facts as 2 multiply by 2 is 4, 2 multiply by 3 is 6. It also happened in high school because students in Korea have to take a Korean S.A.T for going to university. Korean S.A.T questions want to just fact. In contrast, In the united states, they emphasize to understand ideas and concepts. Students in the United States learn mathmatics less than Korean students, but they learn why the fact happens. It's different. Students in Korea learn ""How"",but Students in the United States learn ""why"".
A friend of mine, for example, came to the united states when he was a high school students. At that time, he was good and high grade about mathmatics in his school in the United States because he previously learned in Korea. However, when he went to a university, and he also studied mathmatics, he couldn't very well rather another american studens because he didn't understand the ideas and concepts, also he didn't know procedure.
 it is not only mathmatics. So, I think that  understanding ideas and concepts is more important and a kind of best learning skills."
8944,0,"I disagree that 'In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are tody' for the following reasons.

     First, cars are very convenient. No other tranportations can replace them. For example, car has been 'a people's legs'. When I lived in Hiroshima, one of the local city of Japan, I can not move anywhere without a car. Social systems are in the condition people can use a car. Additionally, I find it more in the countryside, people can not go to shops without cars. I believe that cars are convenient and have been the tools for living.   

     Second, I think that cars will be developed to adjust our life. The features of car can change and can solve the problems. For example, cars comsume a lot of energy and pollute our environments, but now improving their mechanism to reduce bad inpacts. I believe that cars will be developed better in twenty years and will not lose their possition.

     In conclution, for the reasons mentioned above, I strongly do not believe that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years."
3344,0,"A question on having knowledge of whether many academic subjects or specialize in one specific subject is heavily debated among academics. It is an apparent fact that interdisciplinary courses are very popular and a lot of academic institutions are offering courses in that context. Although, I believe having knowlegde of many academic subjects are very helpful to reach a good comprehesion in the studies, I disaggre with the idea in general since I believe that a good academic research can be carried out with the good background in a specific field.

The strongest aspect of specializing in one subject is the power of the deepening in that field. It is quite useful to have a broad knowledge of many subjects and it might serve to reach a meaningful synthesis when they are put together. However, if one does not have a comprehensive knowledge in one field, it is surely very difficult to put the information in a framework that attempts to explain, for instance a case, in an academic way. 

Let us think about a master thesis that we study on. If we choose to conduct a case study, it is mostly comfortable to apply more than one theories. If our master thesis is in social sciences, it is obvious that the case can be defined and studied in that manner. However, I can put forward that it also creates many misunderstandings and it can end into a huge paper without nothing. Because if we achieve to specialize on one aspect, we can draw the lines about the case which will help the reader to understand what is trying to be told. A person who concentrates on one theory can depict the case very well under the guidance of main points of the field he or she deepened.

To sum up, although having knowledge in many fields can sound better than my idea, it is usually better to concentrate on one discipline to reach a better explaination."
12034,0,"I think understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students than simply learning facts. However, sometime learning facts is necessary.
In the following paragraph i will state my reasons why i do agree with the statement.
First of all I think in today's society and business it is important to communicate. Discussing and talking about problems and ideas in a classroom gives you the ability to talk to people more easily even if you are not the same opinion. You learn to understand their idea and why they might think this specific way.
Another important thing is another benefit for your future job. Today you might be sitting in a classroom with a teacher helping you with every question you ask him or her but sooner or later you probably will be sitting in a business meeting, in a office or even be teaching a class full of students yourself. If you have learned to understand the ideas and concepts of things you also learned to solve problems. If you didn't understand it at first, you looked for answers and ways that you might be able to understand it.
The third thing is that it is probably easier to learn for a test when you get the main idea or the whole concept. When you prepare for a test and just learn facts the whole time but don't know how they fit together or what their connection is, it is pointless. You might know it untill the next day but you will forget it in about a month. However, if you learned the whole concept and understood it, you are familiar with it and it is easier for you to recall things. I would like to support my statement with an example: In Math it is very easy to solve problems after you have understood the main idea and the concept of the solution. Some tasks might be harder but you always know at least the way to solve them. If someone would just learn the formulars but doesn't know how to use them or how to combine them he won't do good on any test.
Even so I support the statement I have to say that there are some majors where learning facts is partly necessary. For example if you learn a new language you first just study the vocabulary.When you do history you have to learn dates and ""timetables"". In the end, however, it always matters that someone understands the whole idea."
5417,0,"I fully agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than it is for them to learn facts.

Of course, facts are important. It is essential to know certain basic facts in almost all fields of study: for instance, a literature student must know about the main epoques of literature through the centuries, a science student must know certain formulae by heart. 

Yet a knowledge of facts that goes beyond these basics is not as important as having understood the underlying ideas and concepts. 
Facts may be changing. New styles of literature will develop, new engineering techniques will evolve. Yet the main concepts underlying these new developments will not change. They can still be applied, be it in an academic environment when writing an essay or sitting an exam or be it in the workplace when new methods or production techniques will have to be understood and assessed. I am a lawyer and therefore know very well that no scenario resembles the other. Every case differs from the other, at least in nuances. Therefore, in order to be able to find a solution to a case, one must have understood the rationales behind legal doctrines. Only then will one be able to apply a doctrine to an unnknown set of facts. 

Moreover, facts can be looked up in books or are available online. Facts can also be digested fairly easily. They may be complex, but they are hardly ever incomprehensible. On the contrary, concepts cannot easily be looked up in a book. They are often hard to understand. They will often need explanation and in-depth reading. That is why we actually study them, often for years. This is why attend universities. Understanding concepts and ideas is the key to organising the myriads of facts there are. Human knowledge has multiplied over the past decades. Facts are readily available over the internet. Therefore I believe that it is even more important to understand ideas and concepts nowadays than it was 50 years ago. Otherwise we are running the risk of being inundated with facts not knowing how to handle them. 

It is for these reasons that I am convinced that understanding ideas and concepts is much more important for students than to learn facts."
2832,0,"the starting statement tells about the possibility that in the future could be less cars then today. this point is very difficult to explain because i think that everything depends to the technology developement of today.
since ten years ago a lot of university departments have tried to create a new type of car that uses a different king of oil.  the reason is that in this moment the amount of oil is critical and there is the possibility that on the next years it will be impossible to supply the oil quantity that customers will need.
but until now it is not appeared a different kind of car that uses alternative fuel. only a strange electric car that uses electric batteries to start motor.
For this reason, i think that if the companies which product car or the university departments of technology resource don't look for other solutions, it will be possible that in twenty years there will be fewer cars than today."
537,0,"I agree the best way to travel is in agroup led by a tour guide. Last summer i went to Itlay with a group and a tour guide, I liked my trip becuse I meet new people form diffrent places and  shier same informations. If I did not with the guide I would miss many places in Italy. In the same time,I did not konw the history for the places i had visit.  

Two years ago, I went to Japan with my friend, most of the time we were lost because, we did not speake thier language and did not know thier transportion system. 

Travel with the group and the tour guide is cheper than trave alone and you cane see more places in limited time.In addation, some trave agents have many tours so, you can select what you like. However, they have programs during the trip to make the travels enjoy they trip.

There is bad thing when travel with group, some pepol do not respect the others and make the travelers do not like the trip. But in genral I prefe travel with group and a tour guide."
2770,0,"I agree with successful people try new things and risks. I have some reasons why I think when successful people try to new things thoes are not professional, weak experience and knowlege about new thing. From thoese points, people have to take risks when they try to new things eventhough they are already successed before. 
	First, he is not a professional about new things. For example, a man who is a really successful restaurant owner. Every body wants to open restaurant, like him. He probably has some successful ideas and actions. Also, he is sure about his restaurant food and style.It makes him professional owner. However, if he wants to get another shop, such as flower. He likes flower, but it is not enough to open the flower shop. Even if he is a successful restaurant, it doesn't have a grantee of successful flower shop.
	Second, person who wants to try  to new thing doesn't have enough experience. As I wrote about the man who is the successful restaurant owener. He can't open flower shop easily because he doen't have lots experience about it. Everything is different. For example, when you eat some food, you can realize that every food has different taste. It comes from experience. 
	Last, person who wants to try to new thing doesn't have enouth experience. The man who I wrote an example is a successful man from his own business. Maybe, the he has enough knowlege about it, but he is not get easily. Some of knowldge from book, specific person, and so on. But, most important knowlege from own experiece. I mentioned
	In conclusion, thoese reason which are not professional, weak experience, and knowldege. In my opinion, wherether successful people or not successful people have take risks when they try to new thing. Also, we don't know that successful people can possible to have failed experience. That's why I agree with successfil people try new things and take risks tather than only doing what they already know how to do well."
5400,0,"The question of whether young people or older people enjoy life more than the others do requires important consideration. To my mind there are two mains reasons explaining why this question is difficult to answer. First what does 'enjoying life' means? Secondly, do you think that enjoying life is an issue of age? All these questions considered, personally I tend to think that young people enjoy life and benefit from life pleasure more than older people do.

	Firstly, it advisable to explain my way of thinking about 'enjoying life': during the seventies, all around the world, many young people were expressing their fancy for liberty and pleasure. At this time young people craved for enjoying life. That was the first time in the history that the pleasure took a very important place in everyone life. In my opinion, enjoying life deals with enjoying every pleasure, every good moment of our life. Enjoying life should express hope, whishes and dreams, in other world, every day of my young life, I try to think and dream of a better future, when all my dreams will be possible. With this  way of thinking, it esay to understand why when you are young, it seems to be more easy to enjoy life, much more easy than you get older. Because adulthood deserves more seriousness, more patience, more reflection. Older people often have children to take care, and children become their priority far before their own pleasure. Professional word requires also seriousness and reflection, it could be difficul for older people to give up all their obligations for taking time to enjoy life.

	Secondly, enjoying life could depond on the age, but not really your civil age but your mental one.I mean, if you think as a young people, you can act as a young people. Thus, you can give up your activities if you feel boring, with the condition you are free, you do not have personal, familial obligations. Even if enjoying life could be affordable for everyone, it' s much easier when you are young


Always being young is  not a wishfull thinking, do not forget the better is coming. You will agree to Live fast, anddie young"
11419,0,"The question is about a current topic on the academic system of many countries.  As the matter of fact, the question of the specialization of students is controversial. Should we provide a broad knowledge or should we prefer the specialization ? To answer that question, i think broad knowlegde presents ;ore benefits than the other solution. We have to focus on the advantages of this solution, wondering why it is the choice og numerous academic systems.

On the one hand, we have to docus on the professional aspect of the issue. We know that the labour market is very fluctuent. We all have to pass  through some different waves of changes. Both political, economical and social context bring us to be careful about the labour market changes`. Having a broad knowlegde in several topic can be a weapon against these changes. A technological new wave can force you to change jobs. At this time, you will have to be able to change your way of working. An abroad knowledge can make you feel this change easier.


On the other hand, we have to speak about the individual aspect of the issue. As the matter of fact, having broad knowlegde is a personal advantage. It is important for any people, to have a broad knowledge. To sum up the idea, it is an important thing that people can understand the world he is living on. For instance,  even if you are a brillant scientist, it is obvious that you have to be aware of the legal system of your countries. Having history knowledge is fondamental too for a country, to developp a patriotic feeling. Whith these examples, we see that some subjects have to be learnt by every people, to create a commun base between us. 
 
To conclude we have to be aware that broad knowledge present a professional and an individual advantage."

2196,0,"In modern statistic, 90% of the public prefer to study specific knowledge. In my openion, to suporte this, it is better to have specialize and specific knowedge for several reasons. You will be able to organize your think, focus on specific details and increase the opportunity to offer a jub for every body.

          First of all, if a student took chemestry as a his own major he is not going to be buildired between the other materials such as Physics, history etc. So, his think will be related to Chemestry and he is going to be successful with his major.

          Secondley, the student want to success in his major by giving his concentration to the material he studies. As we can see, the student will be capable in his major. If he took Music as a major beside Chemestry, he is going to struggle with these different sciences.

            These days, everybody want a specific job. So, if we give everybody the broad knowledge, all of them become qualified at the same rate which means lacking the chances to have a perfect job. On the other hand, if we have students who are specialists in different knowledge, the oppourtunity to hav of ,course,a job will increase"
6078,0,"I don't agree to the statement. I love to travel alone. There are some differences between travel alone and travel in a group led by a tour guide.
First , I think  that a travel must be free . If I have an oppotunity to my trip, the place I want to go isn't same with my friend or whole  group members. Joining the group and ledding by a tour guide makes it impossible to go to the place where I want to go. A tour is a thing which goes only  to the place where someone selected before start.
Second, I think that a travel should be flexible. You may want to go many places like the place you see from a train window , or you find a place where doesn't  printed on your guide book .  To change the route from you thougut before your trip is  one of preasures of travel.
In the end , I think a travel give a chance to meet new friends. I don't t need group member because i can find a new friends who has  same opottunity with me. If I had a question , there are someone who has a lot of knowledge about  there.

Regardless of the possibilities, I strongly support that traveling in a group leading by a tour guide is the best way to travel because of the substantial amount of information one would get. 
	Being in a group positively makes a person to know more people. From my experience, a group tour opened my eyes more toward the world. I had two trips to New York city: the first one by myself with a tour book and the second within a group led by a tour guide. Going to the New York city by myself with my own knowledge put me in such a hardtime. I guessed that with a tour guide hand book, I would be able to handle the situations well. However, the prediction was completely wrong. I was lost and for finished the tour in a week instead of the original plan,three days, because of my lack of ability. However, the second trip to N.Y.C with a tour guide in a group was only two days and the trip was very enjoyable. I learned a lot of new facts about the city from the peers.
	Traveling in a group led by a tour guide would certainly cost more. In this case, one has to weigh the price that he would get from a tour guide more. By traveling with a group he can meet new people and interpret the places in more different ways. I went to Italy last year with in a group with a tour guide. The trip was more expensive than I would just go with my friends. My friends and I were in the same group and within the group we met a lot of people. By meeting these new people, we could apply different knowledges and understand the Rome with diversity of information. Although traveling by oneself might be a good experience, traveling in a group is better because of the amount of the information one would get is umlimited."
8257,0,"When people travel, they usually go places where they have not been before. Depending on the characteristics of this place, a tour guide can be more or less helpful. 
Discovering a new city by travel, means that there will be a lot to learn about the history, architecture, culture, etc. of the city and the region. In this case, having a tour guide, who knows the city well enough, will help you get to know the city and see places you would not have found on your own. It can be very frustrating, to be somewhere and not know what the place is really about. On the other hand, this problem can be overcome by doing research beforehand. With the advent of the internet, a large number of sources are available for literally every place in the world, and people can find everything they want to know. I personally, like to read about the places I travel and learn about them before I go there. However, you will never get to see a city form the point of view of somebody actually living there. Therefore, having a tour guide for at least part of the travel is my favorite choice.
If you travel in order to mainly go hiking in the mountains, to go skiing or snowboarding, or to just enjoy relaxing on a beach, there is definitely no need for a tour guide. Such travel is 
To address the question whether or not to travel in a group, I would prefer going on holidays with as many people as possible. Experiencing new things, or having fun in a relaxing holiday, is always more fullfilling and pleasurable in a group. I always need somebody to share my thoughts with. Also, going to bars adn clubs, or just having a nice dinner, is part of a good travel. For those reasons, having people around to chat and have fun with is a must when I travel.
Surely, the issues of travelling with or without a tour guide and in a group or alone, is a matter of personality. Since I am a very social person, I like to have people around me. Also, I am always curious about other countries and their cultures, so I want to learn as much as possible form a travel and like to have somebody from the region to tell me, from personal experience, what the place is about."
10550,0,"In my opinion, i would agree with the fact that young people enjoy life more than other people do because they don't have to do anything but diostract themselves, I assume very young people around four or five years old when school is still a pleasure and a kind of distraction. While growing up their life will become more and more complicated. Homework going along with school will take most of their time until they'll be graduate of an university. At this point most of any human as achieve twenty-five percents of his live and it has been painful. 
	Then they'll start to work. For some of them it will be fine and other will consider work as the worst experience they ever lived. during that time they will be able to do everything they want whenever they want only if is not during the time they are supposed to work. They will enjoy life but they will always remember their childhood as the good old times. Then they'll have children and they'll have to work to provide them everything they need or want until they'll leave the family house around eighteen years later.
	Some years after the childs will be gone, it will be time for them to get retired. And at this point they will enjoy life again even more than when they were young because they will be totally free. Itm is the time when people learn to take their time and enjoy life. Most of them will use the money they saved to travel around the world and see all they ever dreamt about. And then after they had had all the fun they wanted. It will be time for them to accept the fact that they cannot fight against getting older and they'll die sooner or later.
	I will finish with the point that on a ninety years long life, an human would have really enjoyed life around 25 years. Yes I agree with the point made in the statement, young people enjoy life more than older people do."
7642,0,"Learning should be based on ideas and concepts

Mastering the ideas and concepts are essential part of learning.  I completely believe that ideas and concepts is much more important for the students than just focusing on the facts.  There are several reasons for this.

First of all, understanding the ideas provides a stimulus to the brain and helps positive thinking, learning and mastering of the subject.  With the concept being understood, one can apply these ideas to any similar situation.  It is much easier to connect one idea to another and build a logical conclusion about a subject or theory.

Secondly, understanding the facts also needs some ideas to fully grasp the knowledge of the subject.  Without any idea or logical stream of thought behind, it will be very difficult even to understand why a fact actually happened.  Focusing only on the fact and not looking at the underlying concept is like building something without a solid foundation.

Understanding the concept behind a particular theory also allows to deal with unexpected situations in a better way.  For example, if somebody know the concept behind a mathematical theory, one can easliy solve any problem without memorizing the contents or facts of the problem.  Similarly understanding concepts of physics allows a person to apply the same principals to a variety of situations and provide useful explanations.

Understanding the ideas & concepts also promotes further learning.  It is easier to teach a subject to others if one has mastered the ideas and concepts behind it.  

Lastly, understanding the ideas and concepts helps the development of the subject itself.  With the concepts fully understood, one can then build more useful ideas over them.  These ideas then become part of the subject or theory itself and make the application of the theory to real life more useful."

The first reason , advertisements are one way of communicating the inforamtion about a product .Advertisements convey information about the product in a way to attract people by infering the false information.As a result the people who watched the advertisement tend to buy the product and comes to know it's of no use after spending a plenty of money on it.It may not affect the rich people but the middle class people would have spend this money on some other useful purpose.

Second reason , advertisements are important attraction to the people of different ages.So people try to imitate the actions seens in the advertisements which affects person performing it and also  their family who depend upon him/her.This is happening because the advertisements gives only the advantage of it than explaining the disadvantages.


Finally the companies advertise for increase their buisiness than thinking of the people.For example most of the  drinks like soda: are harmful to the people health in many ways due to toxic present in them.But they advertise these products with famous film actress or actor which attracts the people to buy the soda.So in this way advertisements will not convey the complete information about the product to the society.If the advertisements infers the complete information about theproduct the sales of it will decrease which will effects the company profit.Now- a- days  drinking of soda became a adiction to most of the people .

The how and why is important to understand the fact. I think is more important understand concepts and ideas for two reasons: You know the source of the fact and you learn more about one topic.

     First, when you understand ideas and concepts from the beginning you are able to understand the fact better. When you only know the fact you ignore how start. For example you know that a earthquake  is danger and the earth move, but if you know the concept and the idea you can take precaution and stay save, even you can move to some place where dont have earthquake.

     Second, this help you to study and learn about one materia. You can answer how  and why  and this is going to give you a deep knowledge about one area. For example you know if you put the hand in the fire you going to burn. If you know the concept and the idea you know what to to after the burn. Maybe you need go to the hospital or only put an antibacterial oinment.

     In others word know the concepts an ideas give you an extraordinary advantage over the students only learn facts.
You know how, why and"
2705,0,"It has been rightly said,
          ""Little knowledge is a dangerous thing,
           Drink deep or taste not the Pierian Spring,
           There small draughts intoxicate the brain ,
           While drinking largely sobers us again!""
                          Indeed , I believe that instead of limiting  kowledge to small draughts of one subject,it is much more beneficial to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects just like drinking largely from the Pierian Spring.
             If we specialize in one subject, our knowledge is contained only within the narrow boundaries of that subject while the vast ocean of truth lies undiscovered before us. We become ignorant about  other impotant things that we need to know in order to attain a high level of intelligence and understanding.By specializing in one subject, we tend to forget that there are millions of other possibilities in store for us, that there is so much knowlege to gain in this world and so little time .
         With a broad knowledge or several things ,we widen our vision and expand our horizons.We realize that  we have miles to go before we sleep.Broad knowlege enlightens us about the vastness of this universe and makes us aware that even if we spend out entire lifetime gaining knowledge, there will still be thousands of things that we are ignorant about.
        Another important fact is that various aspects of knowledge are related to one another. Without being aware of  other subjects, knowledge of our own subject becomes constricted and we tend to have a narrow minded approach towards things.Moreover , if facts are bricks, accumulation of facts is as much knowledge as a pile of bricks is a house. We need to know what is going on around us to put our knowledge to good use.
      Also, practically speaking , what use is speacialization in one subject in our daily lives? Is a Ph.D in microbiology going to help us cope with the obstacles of everyday life?Only  awareness of every branch of academics can enable us to practically gain benefits .
          So, it is my firm opinion that one should try to learn as much as possible in this short life given to us . I ,personally , would  prefer to be a jack of all trades rather than a master of just one."
144,0,"I agree this statement and we already see the examples of this statement in world.lets take the china as an example,as we know the population of china is to much and growing day by day for this reason people prefers riding bicycles instead of driwing cars.if we think that every chinese people drives to work or home or another place then the traffic would be the biggest problem of the china that is why chinese people prefers the bicycles.
in my opinion the population of other countiries in the world will become like china in next years and people would rather prefer alternative ways of transportaion, and i think the best alternative would be the bicycles.lets talk about the benefits of bicyles;
1) it is healtier than driwing; as we know in our century people dont have enough time for sport and exercise,because we need to work hard and if we use bicycles then we would catch the chance of exercising while going to work or home.
2)no traffic problems; bicycle is easier to use and it is smaller than an average car so if we use bicycles instead of cars than we wont have too much traffic and parkng problems.
3) no air pollution and energy savings; as you know the exhousts of the cars pollute the enviroment, and also in todays economy the oil prices are raising day by day, and i am sure that future's biggest problem would be the the oil and pollution problems so people would like to use bicycles to save money and try to live healtier."
11819,0,"I agree with this statement.

The reason why I think succesful people are those who try new and take chances has to do with this behaviour being the more suitable for adaptation. Before I adress how these actions may serve adaptive purposes, we need to accept that life in modern society, in old society and even in most biological systems (to cut to the chase) is one of constant change.

In light of the constant changes in everday problems and necesities, the lack of hability to try new things -or to be inovative- will invariably leave us lagged behind, uncapable to cope with even the most basic challenges. For instance, imagine an alarm company that decides not to change their sales stategies because the long time way of ""doing it well"" was knocking door by door to offer their services directly into the costumers face. In the era of internet shopping for just about everything, this strategie would have foretold the collapse of the alarm selling times of this company.

To point out on the need to take risks, this company, in the begining of the 70's or 80's would have had to start taking chances training their workers in the use of computers and comunications technology. It may have seemed incredible back then, that in 20 years a substancial amout of people would be purchasing just about everthing sitting in front of a screen in the comfort of their oun homes. But, what might haved seemed like takeing a huge risk, had to be done.

Therfore, I belive that being inovative and brave (taking chances) with work, family and friends is the key stone of succesful life. A life that may not only cope with new challenges, but may actually improve the conditions of those around us, and the condition inside ourself."
5290,0,"I disagree with the statement because taking risks is very dangerous and often became very unsuccessful over many years. There are hundreds of companies I never heard of that were founded by a person took risks to make some money. Even though it may sound easy, but it is very complicated:dealing with employments, monthly or yearly payments, government taxes, etc. As the result, only a few companies or even no company will survive. The result makes many people become moneyless or deptors. Taking risks is not a good idea.

Trying is not a bad thing, but risking is not a good thing. There are only a few people who succeeded by risking, while there are millions who unsucceeded by risking. That's why people who only does what they already know how to do well succeeds more often than those who take risks. For example, early pioneers tried to make flying possible for humans. Of course, the inventors succeeded, but the others lost money, wasted time, or even died. But now billions of people fly each year in an airliner or private airplanes. How did that happen? The manufacturing companies invented better airplanes, based on the early inventors' designs. In other words, they invented what they already knew how to do well. Then the manufacturing company succeeded, selling thousands of the same model, for the same price, and ending what it's like today.

There are many successful people who tried new things and took risks. But there are more people who succeeded by not taking risks and only doing what they already know how to do well. Like I mentioned earlier, taking risks could change people's lives in a bad way by making them lose money, or even killing them. But only doing what you already know how to do well is an easier and safer way to succeed."

What's your wish. You want to have an own car. During the last 50 years a car has became the number one status symbol. Having a car is also a symbol of freedom. Driving through an avenue on a sunny day makes you feel good and confident. 
I have to admit that our thoughts about the environment became less and less. What about the air pollution and the fossil energy supply? These thoughts are moving in the background. I'm convinced that the arabic countries still have enough oil supply for the next 100 years. Thus, our attitude towards car will not change rapidly in the next 20 years. The gasoline price will not reach the two dollar border. Everybody will still not refrain from driving and buying a car.
Moreover the car industry is still growing. New cars are introduced every year. For example, the Mercedes ML, which needs more than 20 litres pro 100 kilometres. Another sign that the oil supply is still huge. 
You also have to consider that cars which drive with solar energy or a battery are still cars. They all will be count the number of cars which will not decline the next  - at least - 20 years."
10874,0,"i agree with the statement that successful people will defenetly try new things  and take risks due to the following reasons.

one reason to agree with the above statement is that success is out come of several trails and hard ships,  success is result of sweat and labour. one must be ready to face the troubles and hurdles in the way of acheiving success, and more over there is no guarantee that success  comes from single trail it self.in certain cases luck does not favour us even though we worked  hardly to achive our goals, though we trust our hard work and self confidence some times things go wrong when we were trying to achieve success by single trail it self.

another reason why successful people take risks and try new things is to gain new experiences from  challanges  and that comes to them, they test thier mettle against them   and  assess themselves  whether they will be cope up with that challange or not and judge thier performance against new problems and chalanges they faced in thier life.

 more over the imporatnt lesson one can learn from trying out new things and taking risks is that gaining experince and paractical knowledge from past failures and its out comes. with this practical knowledge he gained he  will definitly have a chance to progress in his life.he also gain ample exposure to new things and new experiences.

another reason is if we do things already know how to do well we can attain perfection in that field but we are not up to the mark when we face new things and new challanges, so it is better to try new things all over our life, 

finally it can be better illustrated with  an example by considering an employee in an organization, if the employee do the things he already done, he attains perfection but when he was given a new work to do or he attains new position, definitly he wiil struggle while adapting to the new situation.

10781,0,"Do really the young people enjoy like more the life than older people do? I do not think that would be the complete answer. At present, not all the young people enjoy the life more than older ones.

   Nowadays there is a huge development in new technologies, such as electronics, giving us new items and facilities such as cell phones, internet and worlwide communications that were out of mind when the older people were young. But this also, is the responsible of a more stressfull lifestyle in the actual youth.
     
    Most of the time, these are the causes of the increasing number of young people that commit suicide and suffers depression. Young people is still learning to live, but in a world totally different of the older man. Today there is more competition for all, even for finding a job, now a man does not have to compete against the others that live in the same city or region but if does with the men around the world. This causes a more difficult stressfull situations in young people that derives in a less enjoyable life experience.
   
   Sometimes the inexperience of young people in taking decisions about their own life are stressfull situations, and sometimes they take this in the wrong way. The necessity to make all the things faster and better that have the majority of youngs, acts against them.     
    The older people now take advantages of the advances in  medicine than can increase their life quality, and in some cases, to cure the illness known to commonly affect them. They, in opposition to young people are mature enough and have their lifes fully realized that makes them available to have more enjoyable experiences than some of the actual youth generation. 
    
    I think that the way the young people can enjoy better the life than older people is by taking in account the advises and wisdom of old people. We have to remember the old people have already walked by the way the young ones are barely trying to go throw."
987,0,"I disagree. In an academic subject you have to specialize in one spesific subject. In an academic career you have to improve yourself in one topic. Your knowledge have to be more specialized than ordinary people.
Honestly broad knowledge is an asset for an academic career but it is not enough.
In academic subjects you have to your own thesis , hypothesis, researchs and also stastistical results on your subject to  promote. 
Academicians are the people who leads to the society. 
By their opinions and knowledge our life become more qualified.
For that reason they have to be specialized in one spesific subject.
University life and enviroment has to supply them all the equipments they need to specialize. Broad knowledge in many academic subjects , supports to discuss and create new things but not enough. All over the world assistants and professeurs are remembered by their research reports and thesis, they have to work hard and help each other by sharing their researchs. To find out something we have to focus on a spesific subject like Einstein, Archimedes."
7800,0,"This statement typically reflects  the fight between ideas and facts. As far as I am concerned, learning ideas and concepts is much more useful for a students than learning facts.
	If I take an experience of mine, that will examplify what I mean. I am currently a student in a great French business School, and particularly focused on Corporate Finance. I attended scores of theoretical classes, mainly about great financial concepts. For 6 months, I have been a trainee as financial analyst, in mergers & acqusitions, in HSBC. I have quickly come to the conclusion that all the courses I attended were really usefull. I mean that, professionnally, facts concretely do not teach anything, whereas ideas and concepts create those facts and explain them. It is obviously more important to have learned how to valuate a company than to have learened how much Coca Cola is valuated. 
	Moreover, ideas and concepts make one's mind more open. They make one's mental boundaries broader. From a combination of ideas may stem a lot of new ideas, innovation and creation. But hardly nothing stems from facts, except facts and history. Facts are worth in themselves, whereas the worth of concepts and ideas results from the innovation they allow.
	Eventually, some facts are clearly important to know and understand things. But to really and fully understand the French Revolution in 1789, for instance, one must have previously learned all the ideas and concepts prevailing in the Revolution, such as the absolute monarchy or  the emertging philosophy of ""les Lumieres"". The Revolution is not just a succession of facts, and just learning the very dates of it is obmitting the true essence of the Revolution, what it really implied, the consequences it had for the life at that day, but also fur us, French people, today."
6602,0,"I totally agree with this statement, although it is rather simplistic. 
I think in fact that it is true that most advertisements make products seem much better than they are, but maybe this is just due to the location of the advertisement (for example a beach or a wonderful house) or because of the short time they have to present the product, so sometimes a thing is shown really fast, when it is actually not.
Nevertheless I think that these are the only aspects that could be justified, but they are marginal aspects, not the core ones. It is a shame to make something seem fabolous when it is absolutely not or when it does not function at all. I believe that the media companies should avoid this kind of ""false advertising"".
Many surround the product or the brand with fantastic characteristics, implying that the people who wear it or buy it are cool and special. I strongly believe that this is extremely dangerous for the young spectators, who are particularly sensitive to these aspects and have not a defined personality yet, so they are easily convinceable. 
Moreover some could be dangerous even for adults: for example the advertisements on diet products, which are provided with false witnessing and interviews, which explains how many weight they have lost in so little time. I am personally particularly against this type of advertisements, because it is no more a matter of buying a television or a fridge which does not function, but rather a matter of health, which is much more important and has to be avoided.
In conclusion I think that the only function of advertisement should be that of making the consumer aware of the creation of a new product and not to overwhelm him with false and useless information, although the consumer should be however critic."
10873,0,"Today, the television, the so-called TV, is constantly dropping on us bombs of advertisements in an infinite number and often the relation between the product exposed and his real qualities is broken, like in advertisements with diet systems, fantasic lotteries or toys, and all that is done in order to sell the more as possible.
   The most clear example of the statement  are the advertisements of diet systems: they are exposed like some kind of miracoulous thing that, while we are continuing to live our life, can make us lose a lot of weight without any physical effort, and often they have no effects or collateral effects on the users, attracted by an easy way to improve theirselfs.
   Another fake thing are the advertisements where we can easily win something special like a car, a travel or a lot of money by apparently doing something with a less greater importance, like buy some books or a certain number of a determinate object. Then we can discover that it`s quite impossible for us to win that fantastic thing that we wanted, or that this thing isn`t really so great as we can expect.
  But the most attacked targets are the children; thousands of toys or games advertisements are daily transmitted from our television, and they reach directly the imagination of the chlid that is watching them. Often this toys do on the screen a lots of things that they can`t really do, and this thing is ""casually"" specified with some very, very little phrases transmitted in a quite invisible way near the border of the television screen, so that a child can`t read or even notice them.
 In conclusion, is absolutly true that a lot of advertisements about products, like these described, makes these products something incredible, unbeliveble, fantastic, and often they are really much worse of what we can see and think but, as a result, they make us lose a lot of money in a useless way."
7199,0,"Based on my personal experience, I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts, than it is for them to learn facts, because the understanding of ideas and concepts prepare the students to use this knowlege in furter situations.
Fact learning may be usefull too, but is not as effective as understading the main idea. 
For example, there are many students that learn the facts to take a test. They might get a very good grade, but they don't hold the information for much longer, because they learned almost every especific details and tempted to repeat them exactly as they read it. 
On the other hand, students who understand the idea and concept of the topic don't eassly forget it and can not only get a good grade, but also use this information later in a conversation about the topic or an exam where the students are tested for their general knowledge.
If is more effective, for example, in a math class for the student to understand where the formula comes from and how it applies, that only to learn it. 
In my personal experience with diferent math teachers in my school, I retained the lectures in my brain of those teachers who made us resurche and understand the formula, than those that just gave it to us and gave us a lot of excercises to practice.
Another reason would be, that the students that learn to understand ideas and concepts are also learning to think on their one, not like students who learn facts, they tempt to be more insecure, because they learned to register the information exactly as it has been given to them and they don't develop the abbility to agree or disagree with it."
3922,0,"The way of doing academic researches is always developing and dividing into new branches throughout many years. As scientific and technologic innovation develops very fast, things to be researched are getting more complex and hard. Due to this, academic subjects are increasing and their context are complicated. In my opinion, specializing in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects for several reasons.

First of all, by specializing in one academic topic you have the opportunity to discover new things in science. When you are interested in a specified topic deeply, it is possible to consider the details carefully. For instance, human genome project is divided into several groups and every scientific group researches a detailed part of the project. By doing this, they can rapidly get results and combine them.

Secondly, working with specific subjects gives you the chance of developing new scientific groups and working in coordination. Research groups have the opportunity to study properly and organized. If one scientist have broad knowledge of many academic subjects, he can not afford to concern with all problems and fails.

Consequently, specializing in one subject for academic researches is important to the development of science and technological innovation. As we share the problems, we will be succesful quickly."
8252,0,"When I was elementary student, I went to swimming school, cram school, and tennis school, so that I didn't have a time to contact with my community. Therefore, I agree with the opinion that young people nowadays do not give enought time to helping their communities. The reason is that their parents have the children learn many things. Another reason is that the relationship in community is getting weak.
    Many children go to cram school and learn many things such  as swimming and tennis. In recent years, people's academic level  is emphasised, so that parents let their children go to cram school to get better the their childrens' ability to enter the good school. Because of this tendensy, the competition to enter the good school is more higher that that of few years ago. Therefore, the parents get their children to go to 2 or more cram school. For example, my cousin is 3 years old, and he already go to kind of cram school to learn how to caculate and english. Though he is 3 years old, he daosen't have a time to play with his friends.  Moreover, if the children have a little time expect the time which they go to cram school, they will use a time to play with their freinds and don't help their communities. Therfore, the time to helping their communities dosen't exsist in youg people's life.
      The relationship of community is weak. For example, my friend dosen't know the neightboor because they don't meet each other and there aren't event in their community.  Thefore, there aren't the oppotunities to know who live in the communities and make frieds with each other. In these comuniti that the citizens relationship is weak, how they can help the neightboor who they don't kanow. When I was elementary student, the big earthquake was occured in my  city. It is noamal to help each other if the disaster occur. However, no one help each other and they just think about their families.
      The good thing for young people is to help their communities. By doing this, they can get the sprit of voluteer and the sprit of helping people. However, in recently, they are very busy to do learn many things to earn the good school . Also, the citizens are only care about their family becasue of weakness of relationship in  their communities.   Therefore, I difenitily agree with the opinion that  young people do not give enought time to helping thier communities."
4656,0,"Science, for that matter any other field of study, have been broadly classified in to many subjects. Its important for everone to have a basic knowledge of all these subjects but I think its better to specialize in one specific subject. 
                   Concentrating on a wide range of subjects creates a lot of problems. Firstly, the individual may not be able to find ample time to devote to each subject. Secondly, the reader may retain far less than what is required because the details of the mix of all subjects might be really confusing.
                 We always find that people who make their decisions early and act promptly and concentrate in a particular area of interest turn out to be high performers or high end achievers contributing a lot towards the development of society. Dr. A.P.J Abdul Kalam, The President of India can be quoted as a very relevant example in this context. Dr. Kalam identified very early that his interest lies in the area of space science and technology and started working on it from his senior seondary school itself. We all know that he had always been a towering figure in the evolution of Indian space programme ever since he joined the Indian Space Research Organization. He can be a  real role model to the young students.
                 I do feel that an exposure to all the subjects is essential for a student to make the right choice. It also gives him the confidence to tackle new situations and to effectively put forward a new idea before the general public. But ultimately one should try to become a specialist in any field of his interest. In this society I feel one should be a specialist in the field he or she is working to make the other people listen their voice. It also generates a sense of belief among them over the things he or she is telling them. I feel its always better to be a master in one field rather than a jack of all."
11537,0,"Recently, there has been an argument as to whether a person should buy a car if he or she can or should keep using the public tranportation among my classmates. As a person using the public transportation for most of the time, I decided that, we should not consider this problem further because there will be less number of cars in use in twenty years than in today. I provided some strong supports and evidences for this thought.
	First of all, in twenty year, I think that most of the people will be much more aware of the value of public transportation! If the number of cars increase with time, there will be a great need for more highways! Since we are limited with the earth's surface, we cannot simply dedicate all the spaces we have to roads! Even now we withness traffic congestion everyday. There is an ultimate solution for that: public transportation such as metro, busses and so on. They have some outstanding advantages like low costs for both the country and personal users, and less polution of the environment. Because the number of people who think of the public transportation as a solution will increase with time, the number of cars in use will even decrease!
 	In addition to that, most of the cars are used for transportation today. In the future, with the increasing technology, we will not need to ""go"" to work.Instead, we will be able to do whatever we do at home with computers! For example, instead of driving to the university to attend a lesson, I will use the internet to attend the lecture online. Now imagine the number of students driving to school. Considering them staying at home to study makes me believe that there will not be a greater number of cars in the future.
	Moreover, the available gasoline decreases everyday. In twenty years, the gasoline resources of world will be much less than today. Although there are alternative ways to make the engine of a car start without gasoline, there might be some serious problems abouit petrol reserves in the future. To prevent the events which will probably couse a third world war, I strongly believe that the world will make regulations to own a car. Therefore number of cars in use will decrease.
	In conclusiuon, the number of cars in use will be fewer in twenty years that in today for so many reasons. Among those reasons are people's awareness of advantages of public transportation, advances in technology, and restrictive regulations to own a car because of limited amount of gasoline."
1670,0,"I agree with this that. It is really important for students to unbderstand ideas and concepts. It is more difficult thing than learn facts.
	First, they can learn facts anytime, if they wish. But how about the ideas or concepts? The answer is it won't. Because to understand ideas and concepts aren't on the text or online. Even the teacher won't teach about that. And I think the most of the kids doesn't know which of these. Do you know why?  The most oof the parents and the school sides think they are not necessary to teach or need them. But I think it's wrong. If we get the facts and concepts, the children can understand the really really basic part of the things. And that makes children interests. 
	Second, the facts and concepts are more specific thing. Every adults thinks, they are difficult for children so the children don't have to know about that. That is not true. The truth is the adults don't know about the facts and concepts. That's why they saying about that. They don't know so the children doesn't have to know. I think that's kind of stupid. And the adults scare about the kids will learn that something they don't know.
	I think it is very good thing to know about the facts and concepts. I know it's hard, but if you learn that your world will be change. Don't you think that's more interesting thing than ljust learning from the text? I think yes. So iwant to kids to know about the facts and conceots. Then they will interest about the lots of things. If all kids interest in facts and concepts the world will be change more interesting thing ever. So, if they learn and know about tfacts and concepts they will theach their's future kids. And the world will change. I hope that world will be come as soon."
284,0,"In our society, young people tend not to spend a lot of time helping their communities, and that is due to the society in which we live. Indeed, we observe at the moment a sort of individualism, which is expressed by the fact that people tend to live by themselves without taking care of their neighbours, acting like sheeps.
Young people used to care for other people, but that was what the society told them to do. Nowadays, the matter is not that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities, it is just that they do not have time to do so since our society is based on work and money. 
How could it be possible for young people to care for communities when they have barely time to take care of themselves. It is true that more and more young people live their lives according to their personal needs, which is kind of hypocrite in a way, but one has to admit that our society does not help young people very much.
On one hand, studying is becoming more and more expensive. If you are courageous enough to make your dreams come true, you can try to find a job in order to finance your studies, but this does not seem normal. On the other hand, you have some countries where studies are paid by the government, as it is the case in Denmark for instance. In Scandinavia, one can notice that people and especially young people care for others, take part into helping communities. In brief, they are deeply involved in their society, willing to help in order to make things go better.
In a nutshell, I would say that the young people's investment in their communities is closely related to the society they live in. If young people have to bear adults' role in life when they are not adults yet, I do not see how possible it is for them to get involved in their communities."

                        leaning does not improves the thinking.understaning the concept is important ,why because in the case of scientist archemedies ,one day hedipped into  tub to take his bath,some water poured out  he got an idea for formula.in this case he is having an concept ,for that he is storming his barin ,so he got an idea.that leads to invent the great formula.now a days we all are following that formula.so understading the concept gives thye basic idea.
                          everybody  leans the facts from childhood onwords ,it does't require any thinking,or invention.in this world even birds gets new ideas  to protect them selves.by seeing newspaper, telivision,   redio,interacting with media one can learn facts.its not that much great ,everybody can do trhis.

                                     so idea maes an invention ,but not the learning facts.by understanding the concept only one can reach to their higher position.Now a days great countries are ruiling the world in many ares like  .because they got new ideas US

         The successful people are always think about new things. Because that is their confident  behaviour to reach their goals. If they find any new problem they will solve or they can think how to solve that problem. And they are perfect in that because they already doing their present job well. The persons who are already succed in their field are able to do any risks for new things. 
 
        The successful people try new things because they know the all secrets to reach the new goal. And they are able to face the problems occuring with new things. They try and they can easily done the new things.

       For example, consider a successful soft ware engineer working with a company. Assume, he works on projects with 'C-Language', and he is very successful in that field. However, he has to learn the new upcoming softwares like ""JAVA"", ""ORACLE"", ""VB.NET"", and ""SAP"" programmes. And he may take risks for that courses. He attended the coaching to learn those at the time after completion of his work in present job. He can effort more to learn those. Because he has to enter in that field to work. then confidently he can succeed in his thoughts. 

      Another example, assume a successful state player of any game, he succeeded in his team with the state players. Then he try to get the chance in national team. He knows that it is very risk to get the place in national team. However he struggle for his aim. He is able to face the difficulties, because  he already struggled to get the place in state level team. So it is easier to him to get the place in national team.

          Finally, with the resons and examples discussed above I am agree with the statement ""Successfull people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well""."

	But, in the other hand, if you are a doctor you should take a specialization in an specific part of the human body to help people who need, for example, traumatological procedures.

	Actually, if everyone will know a little about everything sometimes it will not be great or helpful. How we will do with a child with cancer if does not exist anyone who be able to operate him? Or, in other case, if you will know just how to make a good cake, do you think you have future in the kitchen? I do not think so, you should know at least few things about how to cook fish, meal, etc.

	Since your chilhood you are learning what the world and the circunstances put in front of you. All the people is abble to affor a variety of situations wich are present in our lifes. Even so, when you get into college your studies must be directed to make an specific labor. The one you think you have the best development.

	I am going to study Computer Science next year, these are general studies about the computers, but I do not want to stay just with this studies, therefore, I will be deligthed to learn about networks and designe through computers software.

	In short, for all these reasons, I am not abble to say if I am in agreement or not with the statement. Learn all the subjects you want but do not forge to centralize your interests in something you think is the most important, interesting and comfortable for you."
4803,0,"In my opnion, there is no doubt that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject.However,some people have opposite opinion,so I must explain carefully.
 we have those who believe that people had better to study about one specific subject.they think that the way is more effective to produce professionals.In addition,they feel that the wide range of knowledge is not necessary for professionals such as engineers and artist.forexample,some pianist who had educated only play the piano.However, he became a very famous pianist. even though he did not have general knowledge, he could live himself.
 Over the recent years, the problem has happened which the young people can not find their way. some person feel that The wide range of knwoledge affcted the problem. It is natural  that people who has a lot of way make him confused.
 In contrast, we have those who believe that the people,especially students  must study many accademic subject.because, studying only one subject make narrow student life.
To sum up. we must pay attention what student to need.after that,we must give them chance todecide."
6789,0,"Travel around the world is a great activity, there are so much to admire and learn. People can travel for pleasure to exotic places like: Hawai or Bermuda or can travel looking for culture, like: Egypt or Japan. Usually couples go this places looking for relax.

If people travel for pleasure does not need a tour guide, because usually for this kind of travel, travel agencies offer packages with all the activities. This activities are for relax and fun. You do not need a guide for that. However, if you are planning to go Egypt for example, you will need a tour guide.

A tour guide is a person who knows about the area and most important knows about history. 
When people travel ""time"" is very important, so you need to see and learn as much as you can is less time.Therefore, a tour guide is the right person to acomplish this goal. 
A tour guide not only knows about history and important places, but  also good restaurants, places to have fun and places to avoid because of the security. 

I remember when I went to Mexico, my friends and I went to visit some ruins and we hired a tour guide. While we were on the bus going to this City ""El Carmen"" the tour guide star explaining and taking about this ruins, by the time we got there we knew what to expect. 

I will like to go in the future to Egypt with a group of friends and we will definitly be led by a tour guide. There is so much to see in Egypt that I do not want to waste time looking for places or get lost, when we can hire somebody that can take us directly to the best places."
5848,0,"Although i think it`s not possible to make such a strong division between ideas and concepts on a side, and facts on the other side, i would say i agree with the stament. The reasons why i agree with it are mainly three. First, i think understanding ideas and concepts can be very effective in learning how some patterns can work in more situations, same situations or really different situations. For example: you can study history just as a list of facts, but they are not simply facts, because you may have some very important reasons why some events occurred. The two world wars, even if extremely different between themselves, show how the imperial pattern, the rush for colonies and for money, can be the same. The same pattern, could be applied to many of the contemporary wars. Once you learn the pattern, the way an event can happen, you can`t be sure you`ll be able to avoid it to occur, but theoretically you might do something against it. 
Second, i think learning ideas and concepts can develop a more flexible mind in a student, who will learn how to think when he considers something, who will be taught how to consider certain circumstances not just an event, but as a process created by more interactive elements. 
Third, which in fact it`s a postulate of the second point, to learn how to think, how to consider some situations, will teach a student how to watch reality, and how to watch at it in a critic way, which means to learn in not taking every fact as a truth, but to doubt about it. To learn a critic way of thinking means to learn how to go deeply inside things, evaluating why these things behaved in a certain way or maybe why they didn`t, and in fact it means to learn not to believe in facade of facts too. Especially in our times, where the mass media communication has a great importance, i think it`s particularly important a student don`t believe just at an event, but learn that the way an event is told can change very much the idea i can have about that event, which means, they can`t simply believe how an event occurred, but if it`s true how they say it occured, if it could have occured the way it did, and which means also to understand if it`s really reliable what they can read on newspapers or what they can see on television. 
In conclusion, i would say that learning facts it`s obviously important, i can`t know history, for example, without knowing what happened, but i have to understand why it happened, which means, to give more importance to ideas and concepts than just to facts. I think this concept can be resumed by a sentence on Auschwitz memorial monument, which says ""whom doesn't know history will be forced to live it again"", which means, in my opinion, not who knows the facts, but who have understood why something could happen, to avoid it to happen again."
5788,0,"A geat challenge in a person's life span is his abbility to change to a better life where life is all about change. For example, the time is change. Having a happy life means when you move side by side with life nature which is enhancing your life for the current circumtances. With no dupt, people who put this challenge into there life are successful that is trying new methods in there life. 

      However, moving from what you know towerd to something else you are the first time to experince during the changing process is not a clear or easy task. Ofcoures, there will be some risks the person has to go through them to build up his experince.

Doing what you know means utilizing you experince you gained for years and you will maintain this knowledge with no further improvemets will not move you to the next level in you career. On the other hand, trying new things will expand your responseblity where will come up with a geat power at your job. 

For example, companies , now days, tries to utilize the information technology and moves from baber worke to a computer database. This implies the staff to learn"
10796,0,"I definitely agree with the statement exposed before, since my experience showed me that understanding ideas is more important that just learning facts. 
 I think that building models of events and things is the only way to study what surround us. Since I am studying engineering I will bring two examples dealing with my field. 
If you can elaborate a mathematic model of how an engine works, than you will be be able to produce it and maybe also to understand, if there would be a damage, why that kind of misfunctioning has occurred, which is the first step towards an improved engine. While if you only had seen somebody building an engine, you will also be able to build one following the same steps but you would not be able to understand neither how the engine works nor why a damage could occur in certain conditions, or what is due to. 
Also if you have understood a concept you could probably happen to apply it to many different events. 
For example if you know what gravity is and why it works, will be able to apply your knowledge to tons of experiences. You will then understand both the reason of apples falling down the three when mature and not going up in the sky, as probably Newton did when he first explained this phenomena, and the reason of the moon rotating around the Earth and not leaving his pattern because the equilibrium between the gravity strenght and an opposite strenght due to his speed. 
Anyway I think it is very important not to loose the contact with reality. I mean that elaborating abstract models which do not have now and will not have in the future any concrete application it is an unuseful thinking. This is the risk of giving more importance to ideas than facts: finding ourselves thinking to the best idea, forgetting none of them will be then applayble to what is our final purpose."
5945,0,"I really agree with the statement.
In Italy, the place where I live there are a lot of advertisements that make products seem much better than they really are, I hope these advertisements will disappear because I think that the the way how people spend money it's not a joke.
I could write a lot of examples about these stuffs.
I have a friend, Kate, she bought a shower gel that ensure her body skin to become smooth just like silk, but it isn't the truth!
Another example could be the lcd televisions that clerks encourage you to buy with the promise of a great view and a lot of light, but then you discover that you need to submit a new pay-per-view frequence to see it.
In past I had a lot of argues with people who sold these kind of stuffs.
I don't want to say that is always the same, sometimes there are a lot of things that seem to be great trought advertisement and after you buy them you discover they are really pretty good.
In my life I don't like lies, and I don't like liar people, and I really hate who promise you something and then you discover it was just a bad lie, and I think that these people deserve law judgment and to go in  jail especially when they handle other people's money.
I think that in the time that we live with a lot of diffusion it's important for economies to be clear, because having a clear economy is the first step for people to trust in their own governments and make world works in the right direction.
In my opinion it's important to have laws that allow people to trust in advertising and made advertisements clear and sure for people who buy someting without bad surprices."
8754,0,"There are ingreasing people thinking that understanding ideas and concepts more important because if they learn ideas and concept they will learn the subject easily. They have many ideas about the topic but they do not know why this is like this and don not think about topic they only memorize the topic and ideas but it is not true for people in my opinion they learn to understand ideas and concepts has two benefits for them; learning the topic easily and do not forget very easily.
	First learning to understand ideas and concepts play important role in learning easyly. If peole learn cocepts and ideas they learn easyly because they learn its details and reasons. People learn thing with details they know about it almost everything and they have a lot of ideas about it. if people have concepts about topic they learn easily too, because they know its much important thing in  the topic and if they do not know every thing only they know concept and idea they will solve the problem easily so learning ideas and concepts are important in terms of learning easily
	Second learning to understand ideas and concepts contributes to not to forget easily because if people know the ideas and concepts they will  learn  its reasons so they do not memorize it. they learn its much more important ideas and they know important concepts. they forget it very long term and they use this information very long term. Also people want to forget very long term so they learn to understand ideas and concepts.
	To sum up learning to understand concepts and ideas contrubutes to learning easily and learning to understand ideas concepts and ideas conruutes to not only learning easily but also forgeting it very difficultly. In the future I think more people think that learning ideas and concepts more important."
10486,0,"What do you want for the trip? Relax and freedom? Tired and noisy? Some people prefer to go to the trip with groups and the other prefer by themselves.  Both ways are very popular and we can see many tour groups all over the world. I think it is good to go to trip all by myself, because can make plan bymyself, save mony and be relax. 
 Firstly, make a plan is one of the big plesear for the trip. To see the gide book and think about where do I want to go is very important preparation. If we go to travel with group the schedule is already decided by the company. So we can not go what ever we really want and have to obey the plan. Sometimes it dose not include what we really want to go and just include the popular places. But each person have the different feeling and feivarit, and it doese not match. So I want to decide what will I do and where will I go.
 Secoundly, we can go travel cheaper plice. If we go to somewhere with groups and tourgides, we have to pay more. Becasue group tour include the special options, good hotels and fee for company and tour gide. So extra fee will be occured. If we will go to travel by ourselves we would chose the ceaper hotel and not to pay for a gide. It is difficult to get the ceaper hotel for the group and some people do not like to stay there. 
  Thirdly, we do not think about other people while a travel. It is very useual in the tour group, some one late the time or complete about a guide or plan. And at that situations we feel bad toward it. In the group we have to care about other people especially they are not our friends. It is very stressful and we can not take rest while in the trip. If we travel by ourselves, we can decide everything and do not need care about someone. So I can take enogh rest and be relax. This is best way to reduce stress while in the travel.
 From those reasons I prefer to go to the travel by myself. When we will go to travel we spand a lot of mony and our time, and no one wants to west them and get the bad memories. If there are many people, it is very easy to occure problems. To escape the problem and make good memories,  it is better to go to trip alone."
1693,0,"There are lots of cars today anywhere on earth, and it is clear that the number of using cars has been steadily increased by the development of techniques in making cars. Although more and more cars are still made for many people who want to buy it, I think the popularity of the car may be decreased in twenty years for the following reasons.

First of all, there are too many risks to drive a car in real life. Even though the modern cars are well-equipped to reduce the risks broken out during the accidents, it can only minimize the risk of the accidents, not prevent it from original occuring. In reality, the more cars are bought, the more accidents are occured by it. Furthermore, the risks of driving a car is much severe than we expect. If we are injured by the car accident, it might cost not only a lot of money for us to cure our body but also lots of time for us to overcome the mental fear from the accident. So, for this reason, I think many people will not use the car as much as it is used now for their safety.

Moreover, there are lots of other convenience transportation around us, especially the subway which can substitute the role of the car perfectly. These day, we use subway very often when we go to somewhere we want. Different from the beginning of the history of the subway, we are now easily accessible to the subway station near to our homes, schools, and workplace; therefore, we can go anywhere we want also by using the subway, not by the car. And the strong point of the subway is that it helps us save our time. There are so many cars on the road that it not only makes us be tired of the traffic jam but also makes it difficult for us to arrive at the place in the time we want. That is, using car can be the waste of our own time. Thus, I think the subway will be used much more than the car in the near future.

In conclusion, I agree with the statement that the number of people who use the car will be decreased in twenty years, for the reasons I mentioned above: severe risks that the car can bring and the appearance of the more convenience transportation such as the subway."
9222,0,"When it comes to choosing whether you prefers broad range of knowledges or just one specialized knoweldge, there could be a lot of opinions just as different strokes for different folks. Some of my opposite numbers would try to win me over by saying 'One specialized knowledge is better'. They would come up understandable reasons like 'If you tried to learn a lot of things at one time it will simply overwhelm your self and you may not be able to master just one knowledge pluently'. 
Their reason is quiet acceptable and very tempting however if I am allow to choose one treasure from the various shiny ones I would claim my prize by saying 'I think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects'. There are various reasons to support my idea. First our lives are limited to short period and we can not turn it back or reset it like a computer. So what I figure is if you have limited time to learn might as well learn much stuff as possible. The second reason is that we are living in fast evolving society and I think the era of one speciallized knowledge is over. People with broad range of knowledges are treated more nicer than people who just specialized in one academic subjects. Let me give you one example. In our country it is very hard to get a reliable job. We have to faster than others, smater than others, even richier than others. At the time like this specializing one academic subjects is like a sucide attempt because jobs are limited and companies are looking for more intelligent people. 
Come to think of it the idea which my opposite numbers are suggesting is very reasonable. But I think what they are claming is kind of far from the reality. Besides I don't think my opinion is not a far cry from the given subject nethier. So in conclusion I think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than to have just one specialized academic subject."
7976,0,"Nowadays lots of people look for success but they do not take risks to achive it . From my point of view, success is something that you have to look for and to work for but it is not something that comes to you without effort. Thus, you have to take risks rather than keep your whole life only doing what you know as it decreases the possibilities to be succesful.

On the one hand, some people decide to dedicate their entire life to do what they already know how to do well but who knows if there is something that you could do better but you are not aware about it?
For instance, if you are a very good dentist but you have always been working for someone else you will never know if your own bussiness would be more succesful than the one of the person whom you are working for. On the one hand, you could be working your whole life for someone else and doing what you know how to do, dentistry in this case. On the other hand, you could take the risk to open your own bussiness and even to create your own franchise.

Nevertheless, taking risks does not mean success because your bussiness can fail and you can loose money as well. For example, if you decide to open your own practice you can find that you have not patients and of course, that you have no money. But, you can realize that  with the time your number of patients increases as well as your money and that your practice is being successful. However, you can never know if a project is going to be succeed if you do not risk and try it.

Therefore, people can work in what they know how to do well and  become succesful after have risked something, in this case money to invest. Whereas, peolple that is working in what they know how to do but they do not take risk are less likely to succeed. So ,we should take risks in order to succeed and also to learn what we did wrong if we have been unsuccessful."
3168,0,"In our western society, where the individual plays a center role, the community appears to be less and less important, although it is 


There is a very common image that comes to mind when thinking of youth and its place and role in society nowadays. That of a group of idle and lazy people, who play video games and watch talk shows on television. This sounds like a cliche, but in fact is what a great majority of people tend to believe.  This common idea is reinforced by the images conveyed by the medias  which are supposed to reflect young people' s expectations and values.  For instance, if we try to analyze the programs offered by a very famous tv channel which is MTV  we see a disabused youth, who doesn't have any ideals and doesn't give enough time to helping their communities.
   This widespread view needs to be confronted to reality and facts.  I believe that we shouldn' t as a society underestimate our youth. a lot of teenagers play an active part in their communities. Some help younger children with their homework, while others help older people with everyday tasks that they can not accomplished anymore.  Indeed a lot of associations exist.  Young people have got a real potential and i totally disagree with the idea that they do not give enough time to helping their community. External factors explain that.
 One of them is education. when raising their children, a lot of parents forget to teach them compassion.  In this case children lack the very essential tools that are necessary to help others. They are self absorb and selfish, thinking about their own confort. It is also the government' s role to educate young people. it would be interesting to set up special programs in high schools  so as to create an interest. Stressing out the importance of the community and our belonging to it is crucial."
157,0,"I completely agree the statement. Everytime I see advertisements and look at what I want to buy, I think they are nice or cool. But after that, I go to the shop the stuffs are sold, and I reakise that they are no so nice.
  First, the most typical example that I come up immediately is fast food advertisement. When I am watching TV in the dorm, I see a lot of advertisements of fast food companies. Big hamburgers, fries, and fried chichens show up on the screen. And I always am atracted by them. But actually, the hamburgers and fries and chichens that I get in fast food restaurants are no as big as the one I see on TV. It is so disgusting thing.
 Second example is clothes. Clothes that I can see on advertisements are so different from one that I can actually see in stores. They have different colors, botuns, and the materials are look worse. It seems like they change the image of the product to be looked better to custmers.
 Third, sometimes, used cars on advertisements are really different from that you can see at shops. They look clearner and newer. And the most important thing is that they write only good things about the cars on the advertisement. Most of the time they write truth, but they don't write all the information about the cars. When they compose the add, they cut the bad information about their products and write only the informations that seem to atract the custmers.
 In conclusion, it is necessary to atract customers, because it is conected directly to company's profit. From this view, addvertisements are playing an important role in developing the company's business. But I do"
11816,0,"I personally believe that the number of cars will increase in the following twenty years.
The only thing that may inhibit this trend is a strong committment, supported by all the important Countries, to the safety of the environment.

I will try to support my opinion considering the following arguments:
- urbanistic patterns; 
- ""car habits"" evolution;
- the distribution of wealth;
- other means of transport's trend;
- purpose for which people move;
- last, but not less important, individual economic conditions.

Urbanistic patterns
Cities are changing shape and numerous studies and researches state that in twenty years nearly 90% of the population will leave in city areas. This might increase the need of cars. A limitation would be given by local laws intended to manage the trafic, for example inhibiting the access to downtown.

""Car habits"" evolution
Technology is helping to make cars into in more and more efficient means of transport, with lower cost than in the past. This might increse the number of people who can afford to buy a car.
This point is strictly connected with that of the ""distribution of wealth"".

The evolution of the other means of transport is strictly linked with politics and the big issues tackled by governaments. If Governaments choose to enlarge public spending supporting the constructions of trains, subways, and all the other ""public"" means of transport, people will be offered an alternative to the car, but if Governaments miss this point, cars will still be used as a preferential way to move from one place to another.

Another point is the reason why people move, that might be business, leisure, etc..
In the last few years the number of people moving for leisure purpose is increasing and this, combined with the fear to move away from home due to recent terroristic attacks, may increase the use of cars.

All of this is true only if individual economic conditions remain those of today (or even better). But if this doesn't happen, there will be no money for cars. Perhaps no money for anything!"
9466,0,"There is a vibrant debate nowadays on whether it is better to know many academics subjects at a broad level rather than specialize in one specific subject. Even if I understand the importance of knowing something well and in depth, I agree wirh the statement that it is better to study as many subjects as possible during schools and college time. The following are the three main supporting reasons to my position.

First, I think that the role of education is to give to students as many information as possible, in order to give them at least a general view on all the important topics and areas. For example, students too focused on one area might be in troubles to get along in group of other students discussing other topics and they might miss something they actually really like.

Second, studying many academic subjects give the students the opportunity to understand what they really like in order to make sure they choose a carrer that fits with their interestes. This is important to avoid situations in which students realize that they don't actually want to work all their life in the area they specialized in and it causes them to be not preparare dto a carrer shift because they lack knowledge in other areas.

Finally, my third supporting point is related to the social life of people. When people get specialized in one specific subject, they might even win a nobel prize in their area of study but there is the risk that they lack important knowledge which are necessary to enjoy everyday social life. Let's think to someone who spent her entire life in a laboratory without any other interests: he might definetly be a great scientist but he may fell unconfortable in partecipating in discussion of other topics (i.e. history, politics, arts); when it happened, people might have problems in getting along with other during social events, like theatres, museums and all the other networking events that are so importnat in everyone's life.

In conclusion, I agree with the statement that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academics subjects and the points made above sustain this thesis in a both personal and professional perspective."
3977,0,"In my opinion i believe that young people do enjoy their life more than older people. they have the opportunity to go to parties, make a lot of friends and do all fun activities they want to that older people can't do. 

young people can do all kind of fun and interesting things like me i enjoy parties a lot with my friends. but i  am more focus in my school work. when i am doing my school work i found it is fun and i am enjoying doing it . when you are young what is when life is started, that the time you going to do everything for when you get older. because when you are old you defenitely can't do the same thing you use to do when you were young. it's the time to take a rest looking back in your present. 

i encourage all young people to enjoy their life while they are young because once you get old you will regret that you didn't enjoy your life, you will feel that you miss something that you should have done before and you can not done when you older. so don't let all the great opportunities pass by and after to feel bad about them.

	however when i was a child i didn't like people who like to go to parties , movies, have fun or anything because my mom always tell me to stay home, go to school only and never have fun. but now when i get older i realize it was a good advantage for me to enjoy my life while i was younger than when i am getting older. it's also help you to get ride  of stress , make your life easier and help you stay and live longer."
11635,0,"I disagree with the statement ""Young people enjoy life more than older people do.""  I think that people can enjoy if they have enough (i) money, (ii) time, and (iii) physical power to enjoy their hobbies or things which they are willing to do.
  With respect to (i) money, it is the many cases that young people do not have enough money to enjoy their reasure time.  On the other hand, older people have enough money to use for their fun.  Honestly speaking, my father have more money than I have.  Older people have deposited their earned money from their long time's working.   And there is the national pention system in our countory, so older people do not have to spend their own money to live and they can get enough money from such pention system today.
  With respect to (ii) time, young peopele have lots of things to do, such as study, work, and local activities.  In my case, I am working more than 200 hours a month, in order to get money required to pay back to a bank (I borrowed some money for buying my house.).  So young people do not have enough time to enjoy their hobbies.
  With respect to (iii) physical power, the physical power of young people is higher than that of older peopel.  But according to the articles I read in a magazine, older people's physical power is getting higher and higher in accordance with the development or inovation in the medical business.   So older people today have enough power to enjoy their hobbies like young people do.
  From above mentioned, I must state that older people enjoy life more than young people."
8852,0,"most advertisements are making the product much desirable.i am agree with this idea.i have some couple reasons and examples.first of all we should think about this on this age. people have economical or financial problems and they do not think about to buy something new and if this people do not show any action the reproduction in the country can stop for a while and it can cause so many problems like trading.before all this happens workers in reproduction thinks about how to sell their new product.let's say for this a new kind of flavour of a hershey's chocolate.if this product do not have a good advertisement nobody would eat it.my secaond reason for this subject is advertisement gives to the product a new form. if i should tell it in more details i would say this attractivity.this is really important the reason why is that people if they do not desire something they do not want to get it.my third reason is when a product shows on the television or on the billboards it is taking more attention.for example coca cola's advertisement, when it is a really a hot weather at outside we want to drink something really cold which can take our dehydrate so what we are thinking to buy? immediatley a coke because at this time at least we have been seen the coke's advertisement. what we understand about this situation, coke's firm could not be so productible and famous without advertisements.this reduce also my last reason: advertisement makes the product more famous. people can know about the new products by the advertisement and this make product much better it is again.
my final words will be about this subject, without advertisements, products can not exist and have not the light to be selled."

           Knowledge is a very  good and commplacate thing at the same time.I'ts a good thing to heve and share a knowledge but the idea is do you prefer to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or specialize in one specific subject ?.In my opinion having a knowledge specialize in one specific subject is better.I disagree with the idea having a broad of knowledge because alot of reasons.  My mind will not able to understand and save all the knowledge thats will be taken by many academic , but if it were one specific subject I will.For examples taking a knowledge about a history as a one subject it's not easy as having a knowledge about history and art and math it will be vnot easy.Picking up a specific subject that you love and you want to learn it its much easy and fun for u to learn alot of knowledge either you love or not ,one subject you will enjoy it and you wont be bored of it .For example I love histroy so if I have aknowledge of it I 'll be able to love it and get exaited and enterist about it.Of my point of viem learning or taking a knowledge from different places is a bad idea it will make you transport from place to another.For example if I go  to learn in a 3 academic it will waist my time and I 'll get board too fast! thats why I prefer the knowlege from one place and one subject either.At the end if you want to take a lot of enjoyable ,meaningfull and entersting knowledge you should go for one specialize specific subject to keep the joeyfull and beautyful moments by having the knowledge, it is the best way."
3609,0,"People go through different stages through out their life span, starting from childhood, teenage, maturity and then getting old! For the past 23 years Ive been hearing different comments from different ages starting; ""I cant wait to grow old"" to ""How I miss my old days."" The question now is when exactly is the most enjoyable period in our life time?

	""Younger people enjoy life more than older people do."" Lets focus now on young people and what they do. Young people start their lives starting childhood living with their parents having the support they need, having the time to play and enjoy every moment with their friends and family, not to mention that they have no responsabilities. If we put in mind that teenagers are considered young, I believe that the only difference between a child and an 18 year old girl will be the same only putting into consideration that responsability will be more obvious but only in-terms of studies while on the other hand they still got the time to have fun with both friends and families and having the time to travel across countries and visit new places.

	As for older people, starting the maturity stage which is after graduating, at that time although responsabilities starts increasing rapidly, on the other hand new factors are being added to the equation which adds to it the sence of excitment. To illustrate my point; as we grow older and start getting into the real world, this is where we start making a family, meeting our spouse and creating a foundation of ours. The idea of providing the support to our family and creating this opportunity to our children to have fun just as we did, is enjoyable in one way or the other. We all know that achieving this is challenging and in my own opinion the sence of challenge is fun!

	Moving on to an older age, If we managed to accomplish the foundation that we were working on, we will be able to feel the sence of achievment by also creating support to our childrent (who are now matures) creating for them the support they need to build their own foundation.

Life as a whole is enjoyable, if we tend to take it from its dark side and its difficulties starting our first day at school it will never be enjoyable, but as for me I believe that when we are young we enjoy the idea of having free time, no responsabilities and at the same time creating our life time plan, which is if we manage to accomplish one day we will be forever happy.

	In conclusion the time which is more challenging to us is more fun and thats why I disagree with the statement."
4473,0,"I agree with the statement that it's better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. When we look around us, we can easily see that people we define as ""successful"" are generally the ones who have and eclectic knowledge on subjects.
	As a high school senior who is in the process of apllying to colleges, I've realized the importance of being a well-rounded person even. Colleges don't just want kids who have great SAT verbal scores; you have to get a high score on the math section of the test as well. If you want to guarantee your spot in the admissions, you better be ready to take a shot on the SAT subject test.
	The people who earn the most money, according to some surveys, are bio-medical enginners. Have you ever thought why? They not specialize on medical subjects but also are experts on engineering. Or even doctors. It's not enough for them to specialize on biology, or anatomy; they have to learn a wide range of subjects of they want to become successful in their professions. Also if you have a wider knowledge on things, you can have more options to choose from in your life.
	The human brain never fails to amaze me. I've experienced that as you put more knowledge into your brain, it just starts wanting to absorb more and more knowledge. It never gets enough. Even if one believes that specializing in one specific subject is better, they should start by trying to gain a broad knowlede on things, because it will make it easier for their brain to understand.
	Everything happening in this world is related to another somehow. It is hard to specialize in physics, for example, if you don't have much of a knowledge in mathematics; which makes me start to think that it is ""necessary"" to have a broad knowledge of many subjects ""even if"" you want to specialize in one subject."
10164,0,"I agree with the fact that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.
When we travel to some new place for ex pushkar which is in India ,this place is totally new to me and I have no idea on what exactly I should be seeing and look for.The significance of  this place is known to me but other then that I have no clue what  exactly it stands for.Tour guides are those people who will know the in and out of this place and they will have wide range of knowledge about this place and its tourist points.So once when we reach this place and visit places like Brahma temple which is one of its kind in the whole world, from these tour guides we  will get to know more about the temple ,the history,other significance etc.Apart from the  temple they will take us to  all the other places which is famous or has some other historic standing .And being in a group its always fun because we can have lot of interactions and have loads of fun.
        Apart from this if  these tour guides are travelling with us from our starting point ( the place where we departed from ) they will take care of all the hotel bookings ,our lunch /dinner ,the number of days we need to stay ,the amount of time we need to spend at each place and etc.So we tend to benefit more from them and the extra cost we will have to pay for this will be negligible.
      When the tour guide is taking care of all the above things we as tourist can just relax  and enjoy the trip .The  whole travel  is organised in a proper way and it  becomes a wonderful experience to be remembered for life long."
5974,0,"These days a large number of people say that leraning facts is the most important and substantisal way to improve themselves. However, I agree with the idea that it is more important for students to understand idea than to learn facts because students with ideas or concepts can enable people to explain things more efficiently and students have more time to spend studying than do adults. The main reasons are as follows.

One reason that students should put higher priority on ideas or concepts than on facts is that ideas and concepts can help people to explain things logically. To be more specific, studens can classify, confirm and assure things with fixed ideas. For example, my brother always tell me the reason why things go on  as it do because he studied a lot of ideas and concepts in his university. However, I did not study ideas. So my knowledge is just only from experience or facts. To be honest, it is quite difficult for me to explain something to other people because I do not understand the real ideas or concepts. Many people told me that they do not understand my explanation at all. That is why I thing to learn ideas is the most important.

The other reason that students can have better benefit from ideas than facts is that students have more time studying ideas than does adults. That is to say, even if adults want to study ideas, it takes long to learn concepts of things. For example, as I mentioned above, my brother studied ideas and concepts in his university. I actually envy him because he can explain things better than I. So I decided to learn concepts by mysefl. However, sicnce I am working for a company six days a week, I did not have enough time to learn ideas enought. Hence,I regret not studying ideas in my university.

In conclusion, I agree with the idea that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than is is for them to learn facts, for the above reasons. When I have children, I will force them to learn ideas and concepts in their universities in order not to have trouble explaining people."
5396,0,"It is highly probable that people who have reached success in life have taken certain risks that others were not inclined to undertake. 
In my opinion this statement could have a certain credibility, even if a satisfying scientific evidence seems hard to be obtained.

On the onset, the issue is to define the term ""success"". There could not be clear agreement on its significance. If for many success means the holding of personal properties or of large quanitity of material goods (money and the like), for others could be exactly the opposite. Success for them is simply the reaching of a happy life, being satisfied within the family and the close community. 

It is true, however, that we could agree in general terms on its perception. A successful person is the one who has reached a certain social prestige, who maybe has a certain public visibility or has influenced in some way the lives of other members of the community or the society. 

In my opinion, it could be true for certain persons to socially succeed (attaining a social visibility) and become known by others. This is so because curiousity as well as capability of taking risks are part of humanity. Intellect makes human curious and willing to explore new territories. The natural qualities of humans make them to aspire to reach new goals thorugh specific projects. 
For sure we have examples of successful people in many fields, like the humanities the finacial and industries and similar. 

We can think about Plato or Aristoteles or Enstein or great leaders, like Julius Cesar or poets like Dante. They did something that distinguished them from the others. They tried new things. Einstein explored what was unthinkable before him.  Dante left us one of the most complex and inspired poem.  
For many of them,  however, it seems that the driving force is not the search of a personal reward for its sake, but the search of an interst in life coupled by curiosity and service to the society. In breif, if we know today that they gained success, it would be very interesting to explore what were (and still are in successful people today) the motivations at the base of their projects and risks."
8485,0,"Most people usually tend to tell the facts without having explained the ideas and the concepts. This would have a worst impact on students. I think it is wrongly done and it would be a lot more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it would be for them to learn the facts.It is so for many reasons: less geniuses in the world, a non evolution of the world and the promotion of a non democratic system.

       By learning facts, the students will never gain a lot. They do not really understand, they will certainly know what they are said,  will memorize it, but will never understand why is that, making them  foolishes or  machines  with no brain. It would even be harder for him to memorize the facts. But on the other hand, if he understands the ideas and the concepts, he would be able to get to the facts on his own, without having to memrize them, perfectly knowing what is going on. Understanding these concepts and ideas, the student works his brain and can even think of something new and way better. This is how the world grows and expands and the evolution goes.The student will also learn how to work on his own, express hiself, his opinions and contribute to the development of a stronger and powerful society. If they just learn the facts, it means that only one or a few persons will know the reasons, giving him or them the entire power over the others, the ability to make decisions as he wants, even if they are wrong or should not be done.

        I strongly agree with those who think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn the facts.  We will build a more effective world that way, and promote the world solidarity ."
4333,0,"Life was a box of chocolate, you'll never know what you are going to get. Yes, I start my essay with this famous sentance. I always consider life is a period of unexpecting experience.No matter we like the situation you're in or not, we should accept it; no matter we were young or old, we could not escape any of those experience. My point of view is that we could enjoy it, with a grateful heart, seriously and hopefully.

When I was young, I begun to learn dance when I was four. I should practice everyday after class. I not only received numorous awards in dancing competition, but also gain much more joyful compared to my peers. I have a vivid childhood. When I grow up gradually, I still like my life full of colorful experience. I never give up attampt different kinds of things, either for entertainment or for serious academic subjects. My interdicipline research includes economics, journalism and political science, much more broader and deeper than others. I'm content with my life pattern, I believe I enjoy my life more than the generation older than me, such as my parents.

My parents was almost fifty years old now. I was always believing that they were busy working everyday, all of theire concern is earning our family a much better life, competing with others, and so on. But things change when I begun to oberserve them more carefully, I begun to doubte myself, does young people really enjoy life more than older people do? 

I found although they are becoming older and older everyday, and they still have their own work to do now, they go to park every evening after dinner, contiuning for twenty years. You could not imagine how beautiful that picture are---at that very moment when they are walking together, talking and smiling,it is the happiness. 

Yes, walking together in the park, for several years. It's quite simple, but i believe for them, it's the joy of life. As I stated previously, no matter we were young or old, enjoy life with a grateful heart is my own choice. All of us could enjoy life well."
11299,0,"Nowadays, a lot of people use their car for traffic. But, some people say car is not good for the enviroment and migh think that there will be fewer cars in use in the future.

Car is really convenient because when people go somewhere, they do not need to use their own power. Even if people become old or tired, they can drive it. And car is going to be more useful because of adding new functions such as navigation. People can watch movie in their car and also can listen to music and radios. Car become gradually more comfortable. People probably hoped to increase cars in the future.

Others think that car is unnecessary for their life. In Japan, long time ago, people used horses to carry people. This does not need any resources such as petrol and this does not pollute the air. Furthermore, train is really useful to transmission. Train is usually moved by electricity. And rate of accident is fewer than cars. When people gat drank, they use train because the goverment does not allow to drive their car.

In conclusion, I prefer number of cars is going to decrease in our future because I want to die by accidents and I also hope to save people life. And I really consider about the enviroment. The earth has a lot of enviromental problems, for example, acid rain, ozon hole and increasing temperature. These ploblems almost happen from the gas of cars. Even if we do not have car, we can live or we might live more ease life. In addition, I suggest to echology cars for enviroment. And car companies have to think about safe more when they produce cars. If the goverment should ban to drive a car, some people might disagree with it so the goverment have to try to ask some opinions from people."
789,0,"I think it is pretty hard to say this in general. Maybe it is true for some people but false for others.
But for the first part in life it may be true almost for everyone:
Let us start with the childhood age, usually the youngest one can remember. Apart from several people, that go through rather harsh times during childhood (divorce of their parents, deseases and so on) usually people enjoy life to the fullest in that period. You have a lot of spare time, school is not so important to you and you don't care about the future too much. So normally, you life a live that is free of sorrow and worries.
After that, during teenage, it gets more complicated:
Many people get a little bit depressive, it is not called the difficultest age for nothing. In that phase of life, people usually don't enjoy it that much. But there are always others, who go to parties a lot, and fall in love for the fist time and all that, so these ones will enjoy that time a lot, maybe even more than childhood. I am not sure which one of these is the bigger part, but I think, in general, most people would say, that this age was not as good as childhood.
Then, after graduating form high school, one either starts to work or begins to studiy at college. Both ways of life have in common, that your free time gets more and more limited. Either you have to work from nine to five, or you have to learn and pass compicated examinations. Many people in that age are getting concerned about future. They may have fear of losing their job, or failing in some tests at college. Besides that, in that age, you have to organize your personal life at the same time. There I think of founding a family and raising own chidren. So more and more your time gets less and your worries increase.
But maybe there is light in sight at the end of the tunnel:
There is a whole lot of people who start to enjoy life the most, when they are retired. They then have plenty of time again, and they don't worry too much about the future anymore.
So basically I would for most people it is enjoyable at the start and at the end of there lives. Maybe like walking through a valley. But of course there might be very much exceptions to the ways of life I mentioned above. For example some people are either lonely or very sick at the end of their lives. In that case, there is no doubt, wheather they enjoyed life more when they were younger."
7134,0,"To choose  between a broad knowledge of many academic subjects or a good specialization in only one specific subject is not easy, as both possibilities have advantages and disadvantages. Anyway I agree with the idea that it-s better to have a broad knowledge of several different subjects, and that for several reasons.

     First of all, a person with a variety of interests and knowledges in different fields is probably a person with an open mind  who shows a strong  intellectual curiosity. Famous intellectuals of the past, like Leonardo Da Vinci, just to name one of the most known,  had an incredible variety of knowledges and curiosities. Then, having a broad knowledge of the world in general might help people in their carreer and professional life. Also, having a good knowledge in a variety of subjcts doesn-t necessarily mean that a person can-t have a special field of interest in which he or she is more competent. 
An open mind and a broad culture can be a great advantage in a fast changing world as the one  we live in today.  In fact we must be ready and able to adapt to different situations and conditions. 

     On the contrary, if we are too rigid, if we are overspecialized in a very particular field, we might be unable to get the whole picture, so to speak, and  we might be less flexible, less able to cope with any change we can have to deal with in our lives. Of course there-s nothing wrong with being very good in a particular subject we like more. I think that only overspecialization is wrong. If someone is competent and interested only in a very special field, he or she might be very good in his or her job, but might not be able to adapt or to react to situations that require a more general approach. 

     Sometimes you read on papers of terrible mistakes doctors do in their work, as not understanding exactly a patient-s desease or simply confusing symptoms described by patients. That can be due to the fact that some doctors are extremely well prepared in their field, but are sometimes unable to analize the whole situation, and they might miss the fact that they are dealing with people and not just with sick kidneys or livers,  to give an exemple. 

     For all said reasons, I do believe that having a broad knowledge of many subjects and keeping the curiosity and passion for learning all our life is definitely better that limit our knowledges only to a specific field of study."
10300,0,"Nowadays many persons have the impression young people do not dedicate enough of their time to helping their communities. What my personal experience provides is that society has a strong tendency to observe only the negative examples provided by the young people and that it is really hard to find free time to dedicate to others.
    Today society seems to love to notice only the bad examples of young people and unfortunately this phenomen usually brings to a strong critic to the young people in general. It is true that there is a quite big amount of young people who are pretty selfish and do not care at all about others,but only about their own good.What is extremely important on the other hand,but that unluckily is noticed by the society just few times, is that there are many young people involved in, for example, volunteering activities. What is even more important is that this number would strongly increase if young people had more free time. School is really hard and requires lots of efforts,many young people also dedicate some of their times to other activities like playing a musical instrument or learning a new language, they perhaps also need to rest sometimes and so it is easy to understand that finding a free afternoon to dedicate to others is not easy. For this reason those young people who are engaged in volunteering activities must be admired by the society because they are able at the same time to care about their own good and that of the others. I, for example, dedicate my Friday afternoon to help young children with their homework. This activity gives me a lot,but often I have to renounce to study in order to have time to do it.
    The amount of young people not involved in volunteering activies is big, but at the same the number of young people involved in these activities is big too. These young people have to be admired because they are able, within a week full of things to do,to find time to dedicate to others."
10772,0,"I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to unterstand ideas and concepts rather than just learning facts. I believe this, because students will gain a higher level of education that they need in their jobs and they will also have a higher motivation to learn.

The first point is that I think students should understand academic models, ideas and concepts in order gain a higher educational level. When understanding a theoretical model, a student will be able to apply it to the real world even if the real world does not exactly match the theory and its assumptions and implications. For example, when just memorizing and recalling facts, a student might not be able to make a proper decision in the real world because some assumption or conditions have changed since the facts were learned. This way, a student will not be able to customize his decision to the new situation when using her knowledge. So, a student who understands the theory and get react to new developments can achieve by far more in her job, which is ulitmately the goal of education, namely to prepare for the work

Another good reason for understanding ideas and concepts is that students will most likely have a higher motivation to learn and therefore learn more. In contrast to memorize facts and recalling them, understanding an idea is less boring than a process of memorizing, which is repeated over and over again. When I was in school I did not like to just learn facts, and propably everybody else I knew did not like it, we all learned far more things when understanding a theory, which supports my point here.

To sum up, it is far more important to understand the ideas and concepts of the matieral that should be leard, rather than just facts. The reasons are the higher level of education with a significantly higher chance to suceed in work and the better motivation of students which will yield to more knowledge."
3514,0,"Considering the statement that ""in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today"" you definitly have to consider the aspects of money. To own a car and to drive it frequently is already quite expensive and people are always complaining about high petrol prices, In addition to that it seems that they continue to increasing constantly. Therefore it could be possible that some people think about using different ways of transport instead of driving a car.
However, in my opinion there will not be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today. Most of the people that will be allowed to drive cars in 20 years are already living nowadays and they grow up with the comfort of having a car in nearly every familiy. I think if you get once used to cars and all the comforts they provide you will not like to miss them. There is, for example, the independency that a car provides. If you decide to go somewhere, you do not have to look up the schedule of a bus or a train, you do not have to wait untill the tain leaves or search for a possibility how to get to the trainstation. If you have got a car you can just go outdoors take your key and get away. Moreover the car is very practical if you want to get to a place without wasting lots of time. By car you can go more directly, because there are more streets and roads available than ways for a train, and therefore it is possible to save time. To save time is one aspect that seems to be quit important in modern times. You can easily observe this if you count how often people mention the sentence "" time is money"". 
In conclusion I would say that people will not give up their cars the only aspects when cars will probably be used less than nowadys is for long journeys. I think therefore people will use flights more frequently."
1210,0,"Everyday I leave my house for school, I see a car. I see many cars. As a matter of fact, i nearly get hit by many cars. They have become as much a part of my life as food. Also like food, I forsee much, much more of them in the future, and for much the same reason. People like food. People want more food. Therefore, they are going to make more of it.

	Some believe that cars will lessen out in the next two decades due to new, cheaper means of transportation, such as the segway or aurplances. However, virtually every household in America possesses at least one such vehicle, often two. I don't think people are going to throw away their beloved sedan simply because someone recently invented a new fancy toy that rolls on two wheels and requires no gas. They simply put too much money into their cars, spent too much time with them, to throw them away for the next new fad. When the cars break own, they'll probably jsut buy a new one instead of giving a new invention a try, since they prefer familiarity over the unknown.

	People often complain about how cars create pollution, with all the fuels they burn, the exhaust they produce, and all the wasted metal when they break down or outlive themselves. Despite all of this, people still buy hondas, BMWs, and ferraris like crazy. People don't care about the polution problem enough to quit driving and take up biking, and major car companies squish their fears by insisting that they are producing more efficent, cleaner cars even as they speak. Therefore, I believe it's safe to conclude that the number of cars will actually rise within twenty years, not drop.

	As gasoline prices have shot up, the number of people buying cars have dropped slightly, but not by enough for anyone to really notice. As the demand for motor oil increases, so will the number of enterprises that go out searching for the stuff. Thus, if anything, the oil supply will increase in twenty years. Even if they fail to find anymore gasoline resveres, the car companies will most likely develop cars that run off other fuels, such as hydrogen, fuel cells, or simply electricity. As the fuel gets cheap, so will the cars. As the cars get cheaper, peopel start buying more.


	Cars will not lessen within the next twenty years, unless they invent a new vehicle that makes the beloved automobile obselete. People simply love their cars to much to care about how neat the newest invention is, or how much pollution it generates, or how much gasoline prices have rised."

8910,0,"I agree with the statement that a lot of the advertisements spread across our society are trying to make products look better than they are in reality. Actually, the reasons for this development are rather obvious:

Firstly, the steadily growing amount of products of comparable function and quality causes the need for customers to distinguish between these otherwise equal products. Taking into account the enormous exchange of information nowadays, it is quite understandable that evolving a product is not as common as it was in the past; Most of the related products are on the same level of invention most of the time. Therefore, advertisments have to come up with a individual way of creating an incentive to favour a particular product among others.

Secondly, the average customer is actually looking for something superior to the contents of his or her's everyday life to enrich it. He or she wants to be special instead of comparable and is thus looking for attributes that make a difference. Ironically, this IS what makes these people most indistinct, since a lot of them are motivated equally by these unconcious desires.

As a result, the authors of advertisments compose their creations servicing as well the wish of the producers as the wish of the customers, making products seem ""larger-than-life"". In some aspects, advertisments are a replacement or addition to religious or spiritual desires: the irrational longing for a special importance of the own existance, the wish for immortality through extrinsical approval rather than intrinsic satisfaction.

In my opinion, this development is something rather annoying - at least, if you are a questioning person. I would not go as far as to call it intimidating or even dangerous - from my point of view, this development is more likely a symptom than it is a disease and therefore not the issue itself but a consequence of it."
11097,0,"I agreed about that statement because of two reasons. 

At first, I think the number of cars will be reduced in the future because of lack of fuel. Nowadays, the fuel we used to operate cars has showed the bottom. I think it will be disable to use in the near future, so we will have to find altinative things. Another transpertation can be appeared or people can use more public transpertations than cars. We couldn't expect what will be the solution to solve lack of fuel, but expect the nember of car is reduced. 
 
 The second reason that I think is that cars can be products based on trend like other products. When l went to Seatle, l saw an interesting sentence on a woman's T-shirts, it was saying ""Computer is a Trend""  It looks like non-making-sence thing, but l thought it was possible. Like computers, cars also a products making by a factory and following trend.  The color, shape, brend people prefered are always changed by the year's trend. It's possible that people  don't want to have car anymore and prefer another more awesome products.

 for these two reason"
1572,0,"Some people might say that knowledge of many academic subjects is better, rather than to specialize in one specific subject. I believe that one should surely posess knowledge about various subjects but its  better to specialize in one specific subject for many reasons. 

Firstly, students are taught many academic subjects in the college but when they pass out and look for a job, they are asked to prove  skills in one specific field. For example an MBA student can choose specialized courses while he is studying like Marketing, Finance, International Business and Information Technology. This helps the student to choose the field he is going to work in the future. A software development company would always prefer to hire a student who had taken up  Information Technology as specialized course during college as its expected that he would understand the work better which he is expected to perfom during his job. 

Secondly, it helps students to take up courses in which they are good at. For example a student might not do well in most subjects in college but they would be good in one. So they should be given an oppurtunity/liberty  to decide the field they are most interested in studying and making a career. Few students are weak in mathematics but it doesn't matter to them if they are good in political sciences and they want to make a career in politics or administative services. I have even come accross few parents who give their children the liberty to choose they career goals or a specific field of education, no matter if they aren't doing well in most of the academic subjects. 

In conclusion, I would like to express disagreement for a person to possess broad knowledge of many academic subjects. After all if a person is ""jack of all trades, master of none""  he would not be able to work in this competitive world which exists today."
11791,0,"In 20 Years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today

	With the constant advancement of technology in our world today, many solutions to problems we face today can be solved. Certain issues that can be seen to have always been discussed and debated over, time after time can probably come to an end. Through advancements of technology and the convenience that cars seem to have brought to human beings, it came hand in hand with a number of issues that are widely discussed today. First of all, there is the pollution issue that rises or declines with the usage of cars. Next, there is the depletion of scarce resources that we use to fuel our cars. Last but not least, is the cost of purchasing a car and the gas to fuel it. It is because of these issues, that there is a high chance that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.
	Pollution contributes to the usage rate of cars within a country. Take Bangkok, a city that is polluted and notorious for its traffic jams as an example. People living in Bangkok are probably immune to the amount of pollution that they breathe and interact with everyday. Tourists however, are a different story in terms of the pollution rate in Thailand. Some complain of bad skin, some claim of constant coughs, some complain on blurred vision with the amount of smoke on the streets. When the pollution rate of a city is so high, there will be a reduction in the amount of cars that are used. The government will most probably bring out policies that control the amount of cars through means of indirect tax on cars and the amount of roads that they allow to pass through at a given time period. In this case, it would just be convenient for people to travel through modes of public transportation. When there are tax on cars, lesser people will purchase cars, and for convenience purposes, more will use public transportation. Thereby, reducing the amount of cars that are being bought and driven on a daily basis.

	Following that would be the depletion of scarce resources of gas. The escalating oil prices have made headlines more than once in any form of mass media worldwide. The Thai government had subsidized the oil price from rising in Thailand for quite a while, and this allow the Thais to continue their transportation as they wish. However, after the Thai government ceased to subsidize the oil price, did public modes of transportation like the subway become overcrowded. With the gradual depletion of scarce resources like that of oil that fuels the car in which we drive in, the costs for the scarce resource will rise. When a price of a good rises, this will discourage the consumers from purchasing such a product. It can be seen that oil fuels cars, so without fuel for cars, there will be adequate reason to purchase or use more cars. In this case, the amount of cars that are used today and in twenty years time will most likely have decreased substantially.

	Last but not least is the better alternatives that our technology is coming up with. On a day-to-day basis, there are advancements of technology seen everywhere. Even after the rising gas costs, countries turned to alternatives of gas. In a few years of course, it can most probably be assumed that gas will run out so another alternative will have to be thought of. Now with the convenience of public transportation in the sense that it is more efficient, less time consuming and cheaper in terms of gas and maintainence price of the car. Most people will be turning to public modes of transportation as opposed to private modes of transportation in travelling in cars. More and more people are becoming educated, and this has increased in the awareness of the environment. People will then try to reduce the amount of pollution by using less of products that produce pollution by finding other alternatives like that of using public modes of transportation. In this case, because cars produce a significant amount of pollution to our world, the amount of car purchases will have decreased quite a deal. Hence, it can probably be seen and assumed that within 20 years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. 

	With escalating oil costs and pollution, gradual depletion of scarce resources, better technology that can come up with alternatives and enivornmental friendly people, the amount of cars that will be purchased in the next few years will be gradually declining. Therefore, it can be assumed that in 20 years time, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today."
7473,0,"I think being youmg means to be able to do things more easily and freely. When you are young, you are less responsible and you have more energy and the feeling of excitement for life. Hence, I do agree with the statement saying that 'Young people enjoy life more than older people do.'
	To illustrate my opinion we can compare some family members. The parents are responsible for both their lives and their children's lives. So, they can not move free from their children. For example they can not go to holidays without considering their children. They should find a solution about their youngs. Also, they should take permission from their work. On the other hand, children can easily go to holidays by just taking their parents' permission, although sometimes they even do not do this. They are more free to do the things they want to.
	If we think about the couples just married, the situation is not too different again. Once you begin to work. you become a member of real life dealing with real problems to survive and you forget about the beautiful parts of living. You are so surrounded with the problems that you become having a monotone life full of problems. However, when you are young, you do not have to earn money to survive. Your family supports you financially. Youngs also have responsibilities like finishing school, but they have more free time compared to older people. You just care about school-based problems and friendship-based problems. Life is mostly full of enjoyment for you. You are not still aware of the real life problems even you hear about them. Most of the time you just think of your own pleasure.
	Another thing is that, the older you become, the less energetic you are. To enjoy life, you should have the desire of living. When you are younger you are more inexperienced and you aer not aware most of the bad parts of living. Thus, you want to do every enjoyable thing. However, as you become older you are bored of living since you have experienced lots of bad things and so you think that life is not very enjoyable. 
	In sum, I really believe that young people enjoy life more than the older people because young people are more energetic and less responsible and they see just the enjoyable part of the world."
4962,0,"I disagree with this statement. I would like talk about my opinion with  3 reasons.
  The first, It is problem about feelings of us, humans. We already know the eirth has a lot of enviromental problems. I think CO2 is a most famous reason of distroyeding the earth, so using a car is a big reason, too. However we already know how a using car is so convinience. If the famouse people or gorvanment said ""Stop using a car!!"", we can't do it.
  The second, it is problem in the developed counties. I said about the car which made CO2, but now they are reaserching some ecology cars in some company, forexsample hybrit-car. Those are already famous, and sometime we can see this car in my city, but it is expensive than normal cars. In the other hand, there are some problems in the butteries, too. Some of people worry how we charge any enelgies. If resarchers make more serveys or think more useful ideas, those will are used more people. 
 Then, how about the developping countries. The last reason is problem of the developping countries. Some of the place in the developping county, there are no an airport or a train. The people who live in like this erea use only a track or a car. If they can not use those, they can't transport some foods or things. I think some ereas must develop to inprove own country's economy of situation, so transportations are most important to develop. And this problem is not only this. The developed countries send a lot of used car which is ofcorsed making CO2 for the developping countries too cheep.  Those will be more inreasing.This his problem is not only the developping countries bout also the developped countries.
  Therefore I dissagree."
4064,0,"I totally agree with this statement because I think that, since that kind of people already are successful, they will be less hesitating to try something new because they have their first success has a backup. Even their new project does not work out, they will not be hopeless because they already had their time and they think, in my opinion, that it will come back if they try harder contrary to someone who has never succeeded in something who will take less risks because, if he fails, he will loose everything.

I also think that successful poeple have some kind of confidence resulting of their first success because they have in mind how they managed to succeed and they know how to do it again. According to me, when you believe in something and you have faith in it, you can reach it in an easier way than if you don't.

We could take the example of the chairman of a big company who starts a new activity different than his first one or a famous singer who starts an actor career.
Indeed, lots of already famous singers have tried to succeed in the movie entertainement and in the most part of them, they have.
An actor hasn't become one of the most recorded president of the United States of America ?

In order to conclude, I think that, even if we can predict a success,"
2416,0,"In many different ways of the transportation, I think using cars are the most comfortable one in our daily lives. Although there are newer technological ways of transportation such as metro and plane(preferable especialy for long distances), car usage will never decline in future years for several reasons.

Firstly, travelling with your car is different than most of the other transportation ways as you may travel alone in it. But when you choose a bus or a metro or a plane you have to travel with other people whom you don`t know and whom you may not want to be together. 

Secondaly, using cars gives you more freedom as you don`t have to catch up with scheduled times of other transportation ways. You may plan your travel or vacation as you like, you may stop whenever and wherever you want and don`t have to worry about the restrictions of bus stop points for example. 

Thirdly, although some people may argue that fuel stocks will be diminished and therefore there will be fewer cars in use, new technological inventions will always find a solution. There are some studies such as cars working with solar energy. Such kind of inventions will solve the giant need of fuel for cars and they will be in use also in future. Perhaps, their appereance and thechnology will be different then now as a result of constant improves in technology.

Finally, as cars are different than other transportation ways, in their comfort and freedom, they will always be used in the future as much as they used now untill there will be an invention of a new transportation machine as speed as and as comfortable as cars."
9265,0,"With the recent rapid economic development,the pace of life is becoming faster and faster.Consequently,few people nowadays think it is more vital for students to understand ideas and concerts.On the other hand,there still some people who think learn the facts is more important.In my point of view,whether to choose or not is not a critical matter,and personal preference should be respected.After consider my personality and the fondness.I will choose the latter one and list the reasons as follow.

The first arguement that can be presented to develop my idea is that learning the facts may make students understand the ideas and concepts more easily.Both common sense and our experience have informed us that learning fact may provide a more general and clear view.A good example could give some light to this point.As the students learning fact through the real example may give them a more specific and detail of the general idea of the thing.Moreover,opposite example can be found to demonstrate that students understrand the ideas and concepts may not know how to use them into the real life,such as the learn the theory on the class and do not know how to use it into the real experience,so there is no meaning to learn it as students do not use it.

In addition,it is easily obseved in modern soceity that learning the fact my be more effective.It is obvious that student studing by learning the fact may be more effective as they can get the general idea from the fact.To illustrative this there is an example that is very persuasive.Students learning through facts which may more impress them than just let them understand the concepts,so they may learn it more effective and do not just learn the idea from the book,learn the facts are more interesting student to memonrise it.

Nevertheless,students understand ideas and concepts also have advantages to some extent,they can know the basic idea of the thing which may give them a direction to solve thing.However,such merit is speculative,what is more if you can see that not everyone can understand it deeply and use it.Therefore,learning the facts is more important.

In these circumstances,after close comparision between the learing the facts and understand ideas and concepts,it is not difficult to draw the conclution that it is crucial for students to learn the fact rather than understand ideas and concepts."
5849,0,"The best way to travel will depend on the particular character, personality and needs of each person. However, when you are traveling in a group led by a tour guide you can miss the most real important things from the places you are visiting.
Having a tour guide will defnitly take you to the most 'common' areas and you will be able to have a picture of yourself infront of the most known places in the world, nevertheless this you can also have doing a photomontage and placing yourself where ever you want to.
What it really gives value to a travel and what it makes worth it to visit a new place is the people and the new cultural difference they can show and share with you.  The people is what builds a specific society and the people is the one that gives the specific place its own personality, either shown by a building or even also shown by their particular dishes.
There are many examples of the new wonders you can find if you really are willing to talk with the locals. However there is not enough time to have several examples to share, therefore lets take one specific Country like Germany.  This example can be narrow even more taking one of the areas like the Baden-Wuttemberg.  This area is known more to have the very famous castle known for almost everybody, the Cindirella Castle.  Disney was taking this castle as his most importan logo and practicaly importilized it,  and now it is being visited by people all around the world. However once you are there, eventhou the sight is beautiful and the walk to the inside of the castle shows a very nice passage, there is almost nothing else to see there and almost no time to enjoy it since there is too many people on a queue infront of you and behind you. In the mean time you are loosing the great oportunity of visiting other castles, even nicer ones in a more calm way. 
The food is another very good argument why it is better to travel by yourself and giving yourself the chance to relate with the local people. It is amazing but no matter where you go, you will find a McDonalds.  If you are with a tour guide and there is time, maybe he/she will take you to a very expensive restaurant and most probably will not have the typical meals of the area. On the other hand if there is no time and the tourist guide consider that there is not enough time, and lets emphazise on the fact that this tourist guide is the one making the decisions for you, there will be a high probability of having the famous hamburgers mentioned before. If you take the time, the locals will really appreciate it, you may even be lucky enough and have a meal at grandmas place.  There is nothing more delicious than that.
There are many reasons to say why it is better to travel by your own, which does not mean to travel alone, than to travel in a group lead by a tour guide, but self experience will determine it at the end and it will give you the true reasons to choose between them.  If I have to choose, I will defnitly always try to have my own trip with my own itinerary."
9024,0,"""Who wants to be a millionaire?"" is a TV show produced and broadcasted in many different countries. Everybody who regularly watches this show will recognize that people winning high amounts of money in this show have a broad knowledge of a variety of subjects. Many people claim that it might be better to have such a broad knowledge of different fields than to be specialized in only one given field. Nonetheless I think it is better to specialize in one specific subject.

The first point to support this opinion is the rapid growth of knowledge. Man's knowledge doubles every three to five years. Several hundred years ago it was possible to study theology, astrology, astronomy and medicine and then claim to be a man having the whole knowledge of the whole world, being extensively educated in any known field of science. With the huge amount of knowledge we have gathered today this is no more possible. Thus there is a certain need to reside in one specific subject.

A second point is that one has to adapt to a certain grade to what industry and society needs. Industry is looking for highly trained specialists, engineers, physicians and phycisists. But not for someone who tells them he knows everything, but only to quite small extents. With this knowledge you might be an interesting candidate for ""Who wants to be a millionaire?"", but not for a good job in industry.

Third, I think it might be quite a boost for your self-confidence to be able to see yourself as a real expert on a given topic. Last year there was a certain awareness concerning avian flu, and there was no single day without the news reporting about it. In most of those articles and shows there were citations of experts on the topic of virology, highly trained specialists who really knew how to fight flu. But there was no single citation of anyone claiming to be the one to know little about flu, but also about every other topic. To have a chance as an expert, you need to be a specialist in this subject, and this will only leave you little time to gather broad knowledge of other subjects.

What we need today is the expert highly specialized in one specific subject. To address different issues it might be necessary to combine experts and build teams, but in a world facing such a rapid growth of knowledge specialization is according to my opinion definitely the best and only effective way to go."
7615,0,"Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know to do well. I agree with it, and I think this is perhaps the summary of how to be a success person. 

First,  to be sucess, one should be at least in the five percent top in the domain he works. It means that if there were one thousand people which do the same work in this world, you should be better than other nine hundred and fifty person. More competitors in the domaine, more difficult to be success. Want to be success, create 

Second, always repeating the same work, satifying with the recent life, not  being willing to take the challenger, all these  are not the characteristics of the successful people. If you want to be success, you have to surmount the achivement you have got, you must get higher and higher. When you chose a new thing which nobody else had tried, this is the challenger and this will cause the risk."
8514,0,"This statement does not offer a definition of ""successful"" - unless success consists solely of doing new things and taking risks regardless of wether or not one succeeds in these new things and risks. This is to be doubted. Trying to find out if I can fly makes me daring, and probably a hopital inmate at the least, but not successful. Therefore, I would have to disgree on a formal level.
More importantly though, I would like to challenge this statement in regard to its meaning as well. By not offering a definition of what ""success"" means,  the sentence is not only malformed, but furthermore appeals to a kind of common sense universality. Immanual Kant proved that the only maxims that may be universal imperatives or truths must be rationally applicable to any thinking being. If we now try to formulate this statement as a maxim - that is : If you want to be successful, you have to try new things and take risks - and see if it holds true for any given rational being - let us say Immanual Kant -we find that it is false: Immanual Kant lived in the same city his whole life, never changing any of his habits; he positively did not take any risks regarding his work either: He worked an entire decade on his major book before publishing it, just to be on the safe side. But Immanual Kant is undoubtedly one, if not the most successful philosopher in history.
His speculation on maxims can help us further along in solving the question of success: If a maxim cannot be proved universal, its scope needs to be smaller. Thus, if we enhance the statement by saying that people who try new things are successful if trying new things is important to them, we end up with an applicable maxim.
As a conclusion, I would like to suggest that a more appropriate statement on successful people would be the following:
Successful people do what is important to them, rather than doing what they think they are supposed to do."
1619,0,"I do not agree with the fact that in twenty years  there will be fewer cars in use thanthere are today, and i will explain why.
I think that it will take more time.
First thing first, even if nowdays industrial countrys like in nothern america or europe does not sell cars as they used to do , i personaly think that more cars will be selling in the furture because of the commercial growth of developing countrys such as china brasil and india.
With the growth of their portfolio or wallet they can access to a lot of things considered privilege in the past like luxury and of course cars.
For exemple China needs so much cars they are actually brand new automotive industry. For that they buy and produce steel fot their own that it created unemployement in metallurgic industry in USA.
Also automotive industry in europe and in USA are afraid by the low cost production cars that will coming from China, not for their own market europeans and americans customer do trust their brand mark, but for foreign market like africa south america or asia.
Second , the price of the gas barils does only affect the economy, like fishermans for exemple. People need their cars everyday, they use it for work and other activities.
Even if there is the existence of what europeans called bio fuel which is a combination of gas and ethanol (and alcool produce by corns) it seems that"
10738,0,"We have rights to know and educate the truth occuring in the world. Advertisements make products a lot of information through television, radio, newspaper and internet. I do not agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than really are.
     	Some persons who works in the advertisement companies give information to us. They have a focus on the some events, and in detail they give their thoughts and insights.  If they all have caught a mistake sensation of the actual events, there is huge problem. However since actually advertisement presents to us after cheking many editors, I believe that overmistaken advertisement will disappear from the advertisements.
	For getting really advertisements and information, it is necessary to be free in our sociality, education and economy. If we do not have the freedom rights of knowledge, education, speaking and religion, I  agree that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Under the condistion such as no freedom rights, we have possibility which prodcuts seem much better than advertisements really are. 
	For example, the peoples in North Korea are blocked from a lot of information of the others' countries. They hear only information which central social committee decides that may advertise for the peoples. However they believe true information because they do not know the information of the others country. 
	In conclusion, when we could have freedom rights, most advertisements make products which they really are. If we could not, most advertisements make products seem much better than they reall are. In United States, since I have freedom rights, I do not agree its sentence."
6875,0,"The students in the class room learn abaut ideas and concepts but is better for student learn facts, In my opinion is more important for students learn facts for many reasons: First learn facts is important because the students learn doing the things, because is more easy the students make and dont forget he or she did, for example do or paint a apple the students never forget the color and form the fruit.
Second the students need understand ideas and concepts but that is easy forget, for example the Teacher prepare yor team and explain this, and the students if not study or review then he or she forget. In many cases the students is lazy and arrive the home and forget your books in the room and begin to play them forgot the lesson.
Third is important learn facts because them learn of your own experience. For example if your theacher it's theaching abaut the resources naturals is better go out the camping and see trees, animals, rivers etc. theaching the importance them the students don't forget that experience.

It's difficult to directly say that whether most of the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. In my opinion, there are only a few people make advertisements seem much better than the advertisements really are nowadays, and also in the future.

Advertisements are used for introducting the stuffs what are expected to sell, so if the advertisements makers show people some real advertisements. There will be many people who are glad to buy. There won't be a problem that if people have known the things well, because after they have spent their money once, thet will believe these advertisements, and maybe some of people will regard them as their favourate, whatever which kind of advertisements they are. For example, food, tools or electrical equipments. They'll be sold well, and the sellers will get a lot of money in the future because their honest in the advertisements. So it's good to make advertisements as real as they are.

We have to believe that nowadays there are also some sellers who make advertisements much better than they really are. At first, a lot of people don't know the advertisements a lot, so maybe the sellers can increse the prise and earn a lot of money in the beginning. Later, after everyone has known the truth of the advertisements, how can the sellers get money continue? They cannot!

All in all, I think that not most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are."
1102,0,"I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.  My opinion is based upon the following reasons:  

   First, the number of the oppotuinities to contact the communities has been decreasing because of the development of internet or other erectiric device or the increase of hard-working life styles.  Nowadays, we will finish almost all businesses without facing any person of our communities.  For example. in my childhood. security for criminal was regarded as one of the most important role of a commnity.  However, recently, the security has been thought of as one of the most significant facilities of a house or an apartment themselves.  I believe most Japanese people depend on the security facilities rather than their communites.  

   Second, young people tend to seek for more interesting or stimulaous lives.  Except for a few arban areas, I believe most young people feel boring in their lives. In quest of stimlus, many young people will reject and leave their own commnities.   \

   Third, there is the shortage of effective resorces to provide young people with the imformation on the oppotunities to be asked toward  young people to take part in.  So, if young people are interested in the activities in their commnities, they will not able to use such oppotunities effectivelly.  

   Fourth, there is no education on how important people are involved in their communities.   It is very impotant to contact with their communities because such contacts will bring about the discovery regarding the affairs closest to us and make our life more enjoyable.  In additon, as I stated belore and has been intensively discussed. the relationship between young people and their commnunities are essential to precause criminal affairs or other dangerous things. 

For these reasons, I agree the above statement."
419,0,"I do not agree the opinion that young people enjoy life more than older people do. It is true that young people have more physical capacity than young people,but older people have more precious experiences than young people.So older people also enjoy their life.

Young people have a lot of energy,physical capacity.So it is easy for them to travel foreign countries and able to have valueable experience.On the contrary,it is difficult for old people to do such a experience.But they are able to think and find many interesting event around them.They may not be able to have experienced foreign countries,but they are able to have enough time to love cherryblossoms in bloom in spring,and they also enjoy the rain drops in rainy season.Many young people might  not think such a thing,but I think it also can be a element for enjoyable life.

Second abundunt physical capacity does not always people happy.Recently,there are serious social problem like a murder , violation,and so on. These problem is derived from innapropriate use of physical capacity,that is innaproproate use us youth.Older people also do such a thing, but the probability to do such a foolish thing less happens.

Youth is very useful element  to enjoy their life,but it is also become an  important element to be an old."
5795,0,"In the first years of the car, you could hardly saw it on the streets. After the time spent, this have expirienced an enormous change. Nowadays it is imposible to get out of your house in the city and not to see a car. Nevertheless, people are now taking into concern how damageful it is and are trying to improve it.

For instance,Vitoria (Spain).It was a poluted city, with no streets for walking ang lots of cars in them. Therefore, children had no save places to play. Nevertheless, this city is having a big change. 
First of all, the city center. Some years before it was absolutly full of cars and noise. There were also lots of arguements between drivers due to there were no places to park their cars... But now, the city center is only for walkers. Cars are forbidden on it, which is wonderful. In additon, more parkings are available for cars as lot of places to park have been removed. But it is great that now people who want to get in the city center can park on a very cheap parking and can walk to any place they want to go.

The example of this city must be followed by the rest of the cities as it is having a fantastic result in the citizens.To my concern, it may be difficult in cities such as New York or Madrid but I think in a few years this problem will be improved in many places of the world.
Consequently, the enviroment, which is very damaged due to the fact that we are overusing the car and the rest of poluting objects, will be improved. Therefore, our children will have a better world to live in and they will also learn from us that they need to look after the environment."

If we keep doing things the old way is not room for improvement, knowledge, advance in technology  just to name a few ,and it  will be no progress at all.
In order to succed we need to keep looking for new alternatives that allows us to grow fast enough as the rest of the sciencies, like for example when Sir Isaac newton created the ligth bulb was after many attempts his mind was hungry to discover new things.  if he did not take a risk and keep on trying  we will be still using candles to illuminate our homes.
In the same way construction companies they have to keep loking for  better solutions for all the housing problems, every day is a new and advance equipment in the market that will  help them to provide to the population a safer,confortable, affortable and prettier look to the construction.
Not so far down , what about the medical advance we have now and all of that thanks to people that  does investigation even though sometimes they are expossed to several degrees of pressure, but at the end everything is for our own good as a society, for the better future.
No to mentioned poor people that were idealistics and started a bussines just based in hope and nowdays they are veryr succesful  in wathever they decided to do like for

But I have to say that, if I were faced with the direction, I would probably follow most advertesements make products seem much better than they really are. First reason refers to profit. Only you show your product is very nice, the people will by it. but problem is their product not really so nice. so they use advertisements to expend their merits of products. Secondly, no consequence and law to control their behavir. In the following disscusion, I would like to reason and provide evidence to support my viewpoint.

No issue is more important than now the one that refers to profit. History witnesses and presents many examples. Such as some products of company lead the people dieth or disable; or some hair condition include the toxins; or some toy hurt the children. But alll this product in the advertisements is the best product compare the sample kind of products in the wold. the people do not know the truth,and buy it. This way can make a huge number of profit for the companies, so they like to do that. Do you think these examples are very persuasive?

Another reason is head and chief that I have chosen to put here. It is no better illustration can demonstrate the view. For instance, the people know some advertsements is not true. But they also are not so much fake, too. So the people can not use the law or some rule to control their actions. This  case is exist in the most of advertisements. If you can see that, you can understant it more deeply.  So the most striking conclusion is obovious.

To sum up, givern the reasons discussed above, we can arrive the conclusion that most advertesements make products seem much better than they really are. NO only did I prefer to agree with this point, but also I were a witness, too."
3207,0,"According to my point of view, learning facts is important for students as well as learning concepts and ideas. Indeed, they are the two sides of the same icon, let's say ""the learning icon"", because facts show that concepts and ideas are right or wrong in the real world. In addition, they show how different ideas can be interconnected or influenced by each other and provide an effective way to make a concept understandable.

Concepts and ideas must be learnt, but how to verify them? Physics is a very important example. You can learn much about physics by reading a book and solving mathematical equations. But how to show that all the learnt knowledge is right and applicable? You need to know about experiments which show the constraints of your theories, therefore you need to ""learn facts"".

Then, facts are important to teach how different concepts and ideas are related. Think about mechanical science, for example. There are many concepts, often coming from other different fields. Students can learn them but how they can truly understand how a system works without studying a machine which is an application of all those ideas and therefore a fact by definition?

Finally, let me highlight that facts have always provided an effective way to understand a concept or an idea. Einstein was very famous for many funny examples which he used to explain his own theories. Another example is Informatics. If you want to learn informatics, I am sure you will be told that you can compare a processor to a brain, a folder to a desk where you store papers and documents and so on.

Summarizing, it is my firm opinion that facts are necessary for an effective learning. You need them to verify theories, to explain how many concepts are related and to provide examples for a better understanding. A famous statement is that history, here facts, is a great life teacher"
9941,0,"Nowadays, Many people put much emphasis on the importance of helping each other. In sptie of the importance of helping each other, some people told that "" Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities"". However, I disagree this opinion. Rather, I think young people have much more time to helping their communities than before. I'll explain my opinion this following reason. 
The first reason I think young people have much more time to help their communities is the change of education policy which put much emphasis on the social wellfare activity. Todays, the education authority, or Ministry of Education (hereby referred to as ""MOE"") puts much more emphasis on social wellfare activity than ever before through ""the Education Reformation Plan"". In this plan, the MOE recommed that each school teach its students to envolve actively in the social well-fare activity. The best example of this plan  is to help elderly and clean the street. To fulfill the requirement of social wellfare activity which gives enough credit to apply the University, Many young people have much more time to help their communities than ever before. 

The second reason is the advent of internet age. As you are well aware of, the internet has ""INTERACTIVE"" charateristic. Today. many online community prosper in the internet world, The best example is ""Sy-World"" or "" Friend Society"".In this internet community, there are many activities to help social communities. Young people have more time to construct clean and sound society through suggest their opinion on the internet site. Sometimes, they check the behavior of Congressmen to make clean political environment. 

In conclusion. I think young people nowadays have more time to helping their communities. I think the change of education policy which emphasize the importance of helping their communities and the prosperous of internet community which envoles major social issues is the main reason that young people have enough time to helping their communities."
2293,0,"I do agree with the statement that nowadays young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. 

I think it is really important that the kids of today do not only sit in their rooms and playing computer or watching TV. But that is how they spend their free time. They do not care about people who really need help and they are only interested in themselves.

For my application for a student exchange programm with the government I was asked to spend some time in a place where people need my help. I chose to go to a place where homeless people can have lunch and dinner. During that time I saw so many poor people, with old and dirty clothes, who were very hungry or who needed medicine. It really was an experience for me. I helped to give them warm lunch and dinner and I felt so good when I saw that the homeless people where happy about the meal and that they could laugh again. There I felt as if I really can help people and that I did something important. But if you go in the cities you see many kids who are laughing at homeless people, who are angry about them  and who say that they should be taken away by someone. But who is the ""someone"" if they do not want to help? I think it is important to change their behaviour. 

Furthermore, the same thing happens with old people, who cannot live longer on their own. The youth of today does not care about what happens to these people. They only say that they are old and that they will die soon. But the question is what they would say if they are in the position of the old people who need help? They would wish that there is somebody who helps with their shopping, washing, cleaning the room etc.

In my opinion the experience to do something important and to see people laughing again, is really important for the eduction of today's youth. You do not only need to be good at school and know how to work but also how to handle other people and what to do for the society. For me that is, when you are ready to become a responsible human being."

 Young people enjoy life more than older people do.

  To enjoy life, their age is not matter.  
 Most  important thing to enjoy their lives is having  strong perpose to
 live. 
  If people do not have certain  perpose and reson in their lives, they might to spoil  their  time.
 Even they are still young, they  will spend their precious time to just
 have some fun.

 I think Enjoying life and  Having some fun time is not  same. 
 Recently some American  rich girls appeare on magazines,
and they show their daily life-ltyle,  go shopping, travering, atending  
party. They are rich and cool. But they seems not to have some special meaning to live. they just spend their time and money.

 People who have no money, no good-looking,but have strict aim to live and the pattion about his/her life, they can enjoy his/her life. 

 In addition , aged people have much experience and more patint
 than younger people. And I think it is impotant poin to enjoy life."
724,0,"I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. 
	The phenomenon appears in a lot of different categories, but one of the most import ones is business. Success is often related with money, which means, that a well know company would take more risk than a small family business. That is not completly true since one has to remember that the opportunities of a big company are much higher becuase they have the financial resources. But if one compares a successful company with an unsuccesful company one will see that the the compay with a high profit is risking more than the other one. 
	For example, Coca Cola is nowadays one of the most successful companies in the world.  But it did not start form the beginning as a big company. It started with only one product called Cola. When Coca Cola was establish on the world market the Coca Cola company raised its porfit each year. After that the Coca Cola company took a huge leap of faith a invested in a new produced called Fanta and Sprite. That was very risky because the people might not like the new drinks and would not buy them so that the Cocal Cola company would not get back their production cost. But even if they would have lost all the money they invested into the new produvct the Coca Cola company had remaind as a successful company. 
	In general, successful business take more often risks to gain even more porfit rather than unsuccessful buisness because it does not matter to them if they loose."

This is a theme that is always in the spotlight, and is always so controversial, that create always the same questions. What could happen if the market when they are promoting products or services be as they are in real life, no fantasies, no like gold, that eventually marketing do that to their products?. Like they were, new the only thing that hasn't reach the market.
Well when people asked me about my opinion of this, I think a great idea to put your prodcuts like there is nothing like them. Because thats the reason they are selling. And if we don't do it, I bet a lot of sellings of some products will come down just right away. Because in the other hand we have prodcuts that doesn't need that publicity, since is a basic product,  and no matter what you don't is going to keep selling.
I know that not the best thing to do, some people just felt terrible went something is underneath their expectations, just make you feel like it wasn't worth it. That your money is value. And to lie or play with your mind is just doesn't feel right. In my personal opinion I feel angry, and just want to takeit back. But that the point of marketing and publicity, and those advertisement tehy put on the streets and meka you feel that sensation to own one of those.
The main point of marketing is to grow up the sellings, and if that what they need to do, is valid, they are not making nothing illegal. 
Maybe may though of this, with agreing with the advertisements, is that some day in the future a would like to have my own company, and is I need to use that kind of cheat, I will use it without a questioned."
8533,0,"I believe that people who are successful try a lot of new things even though they have high risks for the following reasons; changeing time, improve themselves, and enjoying themselves.
	First of all, time must be changeing. Our life style are changeing with time change. For example, people who lived in sexteen century did not use cars. Their transportation was horse, caws, and so on. However, now, we cannot live without cars, especially in the United States. A person, who made car at first, may be successful, and made us more convinience to live. One idea can change our life. 
	Second, when we are trying a new things, we can learn how to endure without conciousness. When we learn new things, we need a lot of knowledge, infortmation, and results of tests. It will take a long time. I respect to Mendel, who identified the existance of DNA in 19th century. He tried mating peas again and again.  
	Finally, trying new things make ourselves happy. In my opinion,  people who do not have curiocity are like old-men. For example, I am very interested in Science, especially Biochemistry. When I study it, I am excited and I enjoy studying it. When I get good score on tests, I am very glad to study it hard. In addition, I can understand what happened I, environment, and earth thorough the science aknowledgements. In my childhood, I was not interested in Science; however, after I came the United States, I took chemistry class, my mind was opened. I felt that I could do anything I want to do. Therefore, I can enjoy my life, now. 
	In conclusion, I think people do not have to worry about risks of trying new things. Trying new things will make them more optimistic and give a lot of confidence to them."
11325,0,"The situation and responsabilites of young people has been always a major topic in social issues. The limits of the latter has been changed according socio-political conditions of each country or society. Nowadays, debate abount young people help attitudes towards their community is growing.
Advocates of this argument claim that although a deep understanding about social collaboration and establishment of  non-profit social organizations dedicated to help others is growing, young people do not choose to be a part of this life style. They argue that they waste their time by some other kind of activities. However, this approach can be critised by claiming that our lives is not strictly determined by our free choices.
As I mentioned before, the environmental conditions in which a young person is located is extemely determining in his\her attitudes. To exemplify this, we can consider a country where you have no social rights such as free education or health insurance and where you have to work hard to afford life expanses. A young member of a poor or even a middle-class family will not have sufficient time to study, to work and to be part of organizations which are devoted to help people. Considering education and earning money as two main obligations of survival in capitalist system, there is no time for involving in social organizations. One further exemple of the importance of social conditions in young people choices is the situation observed in extrene conditions like war. In times of war, there is an immense need for helping other people and whole life get a new direction according to demands of other. 
After taking account all this arguments, I can tell without hesitation that I strictly disagree witk the statement claiming the lack of charity behaviour of young population towards their communities."
2873,0,"I can easely imagine that there will be much more cars in use in the future compard to today. There are several arguments why I agree with the statement, that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. 

First of all the world population is still increasing very fast. This aspects leads to an simlpe conclusion. More people need more cars. Especially the populations in the cities are growing, because there excits an movement from land to the cities for the last years.  For the people living in this big cities or the little towns neaby, it is usual to own a car. So for this reason more cars are needed. 

Furthermore there is another very important aspect. The global buisness is getting much more important today and will be the main buissnes in the future. I infer from this aspect, that in the future buisness people, or working people in general will need cars and plains much more than today. I cannot imagine buisness men without a car even today and in the future it will be much more neccessary. 

It is said, time is money! And so it will be in the future. The third aspect I am thinking  of is, that people do not have much time today to reach theire destinations, because of the very tight schedulethey have.This will not chance in future. Today this mainly stands for buisness jobs, but in the future even this will change. People working outside the cities on the fields will need more cars to get in the next city to provide theire products on markets. I think in the future even farmers will try to sell things online, so a transfer form the land to the customer must be guarantied. You will need more cars for this, too. 

Finally these arguments are the reason why I think thee will be defentely more cars in the future."
2805,0,"I think that many of the young people enjoy life more than older people because they have an a lot of time , energies and other facts besides  the older people to get enjoy from the life.
	All of us birht ,grow, and dead. All things has a time to do and each of them are good when doing at that age. At the age of child or young you have an only jop that is your school at the other time your are free and you can do what ever you want and you don`t have other responsiplty. You can get out with your frend you can travel where ever you want.At that age you have a lot of friends to share your life and make it beatiful.It is the best time to get enjoyed from the life. As a young people you don`t meet by the heavy side of the world. But as you started to get older all things come one by one and you don`t have time to do your own likes.If you have a family you have to think your children, your childrens future, yourwife and go on.
	 I think at the age of 25`s thinking your future  will start slowly and this will bord you. At that age you will be grauduated from your universty and you have to find a jop to continue your life. This will be the small start of getting bored from life. Also when your are young mostly don`t have a healty problem and we enjoy from the life but as the age get older the healty problem starts and this will makes us bored and effect us from enjoying from the life.Also when you are getter older you have scare of dead.
	Finally the best thing to make life more enjoyable is to get enjoy from all part of your life. This will make your life more suitable."
1214,0,"In this essay, I will alternatively consider the pros and cons of travelling in a group lead by a tour guide, and of travelling alone, independently. I will come to the conclusion that it is both more gratifying and more profitable to travel by your own. I will illustrate my point of view with the experience I have of travelling alone in Brazil.

One can think that having one`s trip organized by a tour guide offers many advantages. When one visits a foreign country whose language and culture one completely ignores, being led by a professional, and being part of a group of tourists, can make one feel more secure. For instance, the guide will help the tourists  interact with the local population, playing the role of an interpret. He will also lead the tourists in places he will have chosen for their cultural value and their safety. 

Unfortunately, these very advantages are likely to impoverish one`s trip. Firstly, the journey being both controled by the guide, and dependent on the dynamics of the group, one will not have an occasion to adapt the trip to his own interests. And as one will rely on the services of the guide, one will mostly remain passive. 

On the other hand, travelling alone might seem to be more dangerous, or at least more uncertain. No one will take care of you, no one (except maybe guide books) will tell you where to go and who to talk to during you travel. But the freedom you will gain will allow you to make your trip exactly what you want it to be. And since you will have to organize yourself, since will have to face and solve   unexpected problems, you will gain a lot of experience.

My trip to Brazil taught me that. Last year I left France, all by myself, to spend several months in Brazil. There, I had to do everything by myself. I had to find a job to earn money, I had to look for accomodation, I had to meet people with whom I had no previous contact, and make new friends. And I had to decide what it was that I wanted to do there, where to go, what kind of life to live. All of this was a real challenge, but I learned a lot from it.

Really, I think that travelling alone is more positive"
5912,0,"At first, we should make a definition of enjoyment. When poeple have a bad meaning of enjoyment, they numerate drinking, playing with trivial things and unrestricted acitivities. But I want to make a distinction between good meaning of enjoyment and bad meaning. I think that young people can be described as a progessing unit to become a sound personality. In this case of young people, enjoyment can be a good way to enhance their ability to become a adult. If person could not have a chance to learn the good way to enjoy himself, he would not know how to make his life meaningful with balance between enjoyment and temperance.
The emphasis only on temperance can cause a stiff life and dry life style. To young people, the enjoyment means physical activities related with sports, travel, outdoor campaign. Because young people usually hav much more energy than the old, they can show their desire to enjoy their life more apparently that the old. From this difference, some people think that youg people enjoy life that older people do. But it is based on the different way to show their taste, not the fundamental difference between the younger and the older.
For example, as people get older, they realize that the outdoor activities are sometimes beyond thier physical capacitiy. This realization does not mean that the older give up their desire to enjoy their life. They want to find more comfortable ways to enjoy their leisure time as far as thier body condition can not be hurted. It will be very wiser for them to adjust their taste to situation.
So, in the matter of visible level of the enjoyment, young people seem to enjoy life that older people do. The visible thing can not explain all of the enjoyment. If we apply the enjoyment to the very limited category, the old people who do a yoga for health in leisure time would fall into the categoy of patients who want to recover from disease. widening the meaning of enjoyment can be helpful for us to understand each other. Enjoying their life according to their situation can not be blamed. The one thing that young people should keep in mind is that the enjoyment should be accompanied by temperance.
Usually, young people do not be equipped with temperance. They have less experience than the old. Young people take a lesson from old generation. As time goes by, young people follow the way that the old had trodden. 
Enjoying life is very important. Making life rich and giving a room aside from busy job is a basic function of the enjoyment."
7358,0,"Throughout the centuries there have been many talks on what kind of education would be best for students. Is it more important to help students understand ideas and concepts of what they're learning, or is it more important to help students learn the facts? Different countries have come up with different solutions to these questions, and as a person who studied under both types of education system, I will say that I personally believe it is more important for students to understand the ideas and concepts than to learn facts.
	From my personal experience of studying under the Korean education system for a year and from hearing my peers' first-hand experiences, I say that Korean education is more concerned on teaching facts rather than ideas and concepts to students. Students memorize facts and statistics, line after line, without even understanding the meaning of what they are learning. This has a harmful effect in a long run because after examination is over, students will no longer remember what they learned.
	On the contrast, if students come to understand ideas and concepts of what they are learning, the knowledge has become their own and will stay in them for long term. For instance, when I was little, I hated science because I had to memorize numerous formulas and facts that I did not understand. However, under new American science teacher I began to thrive in science as he taught me the basic ideas and concepts of science. As I understood what I learned and digested it as my own, I came to appreciate science more. 
	In conclusion, although both types of educaton is necessary and students need to understand and learn both ideas/concepts and facts, I think it is more important for students to understand facts and concepts first because it will be much easier to learn the facts after understanding the concept."
5023,0,"I agree with the statement that successful people should try the new things even it will take risks.As the discuss below:
First of all, it is true that successful people have already had their own bussiness, and if they still engage the same bussiness, they can do them very well. But we can not ignore the extra income of the other opportunities. It likes why some famous companies will renew their goods again and again. Because they know if they can creat the new goods which are better and can be accept by the clients, it will feedback much more profites than before. So consider about these, those worries on risks are not very important.
Further more, every new taste for those successful people is means a new task in their lives. For instance, Bill Gates, the CEO of microsoft, is very famous for his adventuresome behavior. At first he creat the system of personal computer-DOS and Windows. After that, he turn his sight to the interenet surfing tool-IE. Maybe someone will hold their view for Bill Gates, but no one can ignore his ways of thinking.
At last, the value of one person also depend on the result of his career. Many successful people have many different kinds of careers. Those different kinds of careers was not build by one day or one time. These people also do them one by one. And in the end, they catch their goals one by one, just like some famous scientists, Newton, Aistance and Aidicent. 
To sum up, successful people should try new things, that is why human beings can develope very quickly. Because under every risk, it will give back more valuable things in the furture."
7140,0,"Yes, i totally agree with this term of travelling in a group led by a tour guide. It is mainly because as we are a tourist so we dont know much about the places in a particular place. We will visit only those places which are known to us. But if you travel in a gruoup led by a tour guide you will be able to see more new places that u have neevr imagined to see in that particular place. 
The tour guide plays a very important role in making our tour very intresting and adventurous. He tells us about the stories of the different places of that place and make us feel more and more excited to visit that place. 
I visited Agra (India). I was traveling with my friends and we all planned to hire for a tour that is led by a guide so that we can visit more and more places and can come to know about the history of those places. As i know, Agra is a city of history. It have lots of history in it and i wanted to know the proper history of that place. I was sure that only a group tour guide can only tell us about it and i was not wrong at all. He told the whole group about the history of all those historical places in that town. As we know one of the Seven Wonders 'Taj Mahal' is also located in that city. I was touched by listning the history of that Wonder. Not only me but the whole group was touched by what all he told us about it. 
I think i was not in that group with that guide i would have never enjoyed my trip to Agra. As i would not have come to know all wat he told to the whole group. The history of great Taj Mahal. 
Since then i love to travel in a group which is led by a tour guide. Actually what i think one should must visit new places in a group led by a tour guide. Im saying so mainly because you come to know about the places of that town and everything about that town. If you like it then you can come again on your own without a torurist guide. But if you are visitng a new place for the first time then you have to travel in a group which is lead by a tour guide. If you have a tour guide then you need not have to take ant tension for accomodation traveeling from one place to another. All these tasks are done by a tour guide only. We dont even have to buy tickets again and again. In all when we are travelling in a group led by a tour guide we are in a full mood of enjoying. No work tension nothing. Only enjoyment and enjoyment.			
So i think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide."
7730,0,"Some people say ""no risk, no fun"" and because of this no profits and furthermore no success. I definitely agree with these people and with the given statement. 	   
  Of course there are witnessed examples of successful people who just copied ideas in order to earn big profits.  Of course many people who do not run a business in which risk and creativity are daily questions, are able to realize a nice career as well as high wages. And of course people who define success in a completely different way such as being a member of a kind of club maybe even the captain of a bowling team are successful with a high degree of riskaversion.

But from my point of view people are only successful if they are able to change their environment significantly. I do not reffer to the direct environment as the personal social context of an individual. I am talking about changing the whole society or at least the business sector you are concerned with. What would our world look like without great reformers and visons of few people? Personalities like M. L. King, Adam Smith or Mahatma Gandhi changed their society with their inventions, theories or opinions. But without taking risks or thinking in new dimensions, developments that occured as a result of their thinking would not have been possible until now.
To be successful it demands a low level of riskaversion, a genious strategy (that can be a simple strategy as well) and the ability to implement it. And facts you already know might be the basic knowledge to explore several ideas but without risk and the willingness to do something completely new success cannot be realized.

Finally I totally agree with the given statement. I would like to strengthen my opinion again by repeating that from my point of view risk and success are strong partners that cannot be changed."
11096,0,"If someone only knows a lot facts (like dates, names, locations, time periods etc.), he is definetly predestined to be the next candidate on the show ""Who wants to be a millionair"". But if he does not know the supporting ideas and concepts that actually connect all the single facts to a logical whole, he is of no greater use for anything else. In my opinion, it is our understanding of ideas and concepts that determine our ability to think analytically and to develop new ideas and concepts of our own. I therefore agree with the statement.

Students go to school and to college in order to get prepared for their professional life in the future. In most cases, their career will not depend on their knowledge of certain facts but rather on their ability to understand and grasp the WHY behind those facts and eventually create something new on their own. 
Consider a business economics student: If he is going to work in some business in a free economy, he needs to be able to understand for instance the competitors' success with a particular product. It does not help to do that the competitor produces that product and that it successfull in doing so. Rather it is necessary to understand the concept behind the product, that makes it successfull. In other words, he needs to know WHY the product is sold so well. Therefore, it is important that students learn how to analyze facts and situations. Accordingly, teachers have to emphasize on critical thinking and understanding rather than learning by heart.
Now consider a biology student. If he wants to work for the research  and development department of some big pharmaceutical company, he must sooner or later be able to to improve existing medicine or even invent one himself. He can only do so by firstly understanding the illness and what it does to the human body. Or he has to understand how an already existing medicine works and in which ways it could be improved. The former student therefore relies on his ability to understand a concept in order to improve it or create a new one. Again, this clearly shows that it is most important to train students to develop a keen analytical sense.

These two examples can only give a small impression of how important understanding ideas and concepts is in contrast to simply learning them. But I am sure that focusing on understanding will help any student who wants to work in a challenging surrounding."
8215,0,"I disagree with the statement that twenty years from now there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
Nowadays people are realising the benefits that the automobiles  provide to people.Its more convienient to travel by a car than by  other means of transport as cars provide us with a sort of freedom that we don't get from other maens of transport
And  since the economy is improving more and more people can afford to buy cars.This will lead to an increase in the number of cars in the near future as m
Nowdays the automobile companies provide variety of comforts with the car and hence make travelling more fun in the car.and thse comforts will only increase as the time goes on.
The safety standards of the car is also being steadily improved upon thus making a car journey  much more safer .The safety standars can only improve with time thus making cars much more safer than other means of transport.
Moreover it is easier to buy a car nowdays with the reduction in prices and the variety which is available .and a few year from now we will see more variety thus prompting people to discard their old cars and buy a new one.
Also the one thing that will never go away is the enjoyment one gets while driving a car.This will never go away and will make people buy cars.
Then their is the reason of economic superiority that we humans tend to show which make people buy many cars.
Thus all these reasons suggest that their will never be a reduction in the demands of car and hence we will see more and more cars on the roads few years from now ."
6023,0,"We are facing thousands of advertisements in our life. They are easy to say ""nothing is better than this"". However are they all true?
I don't think so. They do 'over-advertising' the product than the real ability of it.

   First, i declare most advertisements make goods seem much better than they are because of my experiences. Last year, i had really long black hair but my hair condition was not good so that i decided to make my hair healthier. At that time, a ran into some advertisment with a very attracitive woman and her hair looked like silk. What i felt that time was, if i use that product i would have facinating hair like that woman's! I used it for a long time but i couldn't have had a silky hair like that woman. First i was depressed, but than i began to think, that's what advertisers do. 'Over-advertising'.

    Moreover, in my opinion there is resonable reason that the company has to over-advertising.  From my experience that i mentioned above,  i was wandering why they are doing it? Why couldn't be just honest so that no one would expect which would be never happend. Then, i got the idea. There's hundreds of different shampoo in the market.

In the last years Tv developed very much and commercials are always more in our today life. 
Most of Tv broadcasts rely on the money that are provided by the commeracials showed on their cahnnels. 
Of course Companies of the products shown on tv need to make as much money as possible, and this is why they tend to make their products seem much better than they really are.  
Advertisements are not only selling you a product. 
They are selling you a product, a fantasy, and they are also sending you a message. 
        The primary goal of products companies is certainly to sell their products so they of course show you the utilty of the object in question, providing you the informations about it. 
On tv the time is so short and limited that they can avoid to spend too much time to show you the quality of the product. 
Consequently the quality really decraese also in the reality. 
        One of the parts that obviously the companies care about the most, is the fantsy that they are selling you, infact, in the world of today where most of things are fantasies, unreal, or abstract the TV ends to be our reality. At least the one we believe to. 
With their advertisements the compnaies that whenever you will be using that specific product the commerical will come to your mind and depicts the devices in a better way. 
         The third aspect imprtant in TV commercials is given by the fact that companies send you a message through their advertisement. They tell you that if you use that specific kind of cell phone or you wear that particular kind of shirt you will be cooler, or more self confident or more relaxed. They practically tell you the way you will feel using that product, and that of course affect people's mind.  
          Nowadays televison certainly make products seem much better than they really are. This is regulated by the law of the televison thatis basically that people like to be tricked and beshown unreal things"
4927,0,"For me ,it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in only one subject.Because the more knowledge we gain the more opputunitues for having jobs we would have.

Having broad knowledge is the key element which we can gain jobs.For example, I want to study accounting at university ,and later I will have got  the CPA .However , I will choose to study how to direct  film as my subsidiary major because if one day I am tired with my  carreer as an accountant , I can stil   choose another job as a director.

Secondly. I think when we gain more knowledge we can learn a lot of beneficial things of those knoledge .For instance ,when we learn about the history ,we can learn about the major  facts or issues that happened in the past ,we can  try to circumvent those malicious facts such as the WW2 and other disasters ,and we can make some improvments from those historiucal facts.

Thirdly ,learning more things can give us another aspect of viewing the world .From learning we can not only gain  the knowledge from the academic subjects but also expand our minds.For example ,when I was a child I viewed everything in the world with a narrow mind ,but since I went to the high school I lea

In conclusion ,I agree on that we should better to have broad knowledge of many academic sujects because it can give us more advantages than it gives us drawbacks."
10158,0,"The issue at hand is that the young people do to not give much time to helping their communities. Yes I agree with this statement. This issue is very important as it shows the unawareness of young people towards their communities. I don't know what's wrong with today's generation. Now a days nobody is concerned about the welfare of their communities. Every individual is so busy in his/her own lives that they are not even bothered about this.

The first reason is that the youth today is so much interested in just filling  their own coffers  and for them wealth is everything that they don't have a single second to waste on such a stupid issue as thought by them. 

The second reason is that they are forgetting the value of a community. Today people have become so selfish and so inhumane that they show no responsibility towards their communities. They are just flowing with the tide of 21st Century and don't want to realise their duties. 

Furthermore, its the modern times which has completely trapped the youth in its web and is not letting them to make a noble move towards this issue. Well its hightime and the youth will have to come back from hibernation, otherwise their ignorance regarding this issue will simply destroy the values and ethics from the society.

Lastly, I feel that the elders should take part to help young people to be an active player in helping their communities. The elders could be the right teachers under whose able guidance the life of youth can flourish."
5198,0,"In essence, I totally agree that a broad span of knowledge of many subjects is better than specialization in one subject.


A broad knowledge span of many academic fields contributes to the overall scholarly status, or level of education, of a person. The world  we live in  revolves around everything we can perceive from science to literature to general knowledge. For example, a physicist who can only talk about physics and the very technical areas of his field of study is, at least to me, very difficult to be called a scholarly person. It is true that he may excel in his own field of specialization but he will find it to earn respect from people in the society in general, partly because his lack of knowledge of 'other' subjects implicitly implies his disregard for the people  engaged in these 'other' subjects. To me, this physicist can not be called an educated person.

In my opinion, no one field of specialization can evolve and flourish solely on its own. After all, whatever ideas, however abstract, that are involved in that field are developed and perceived by human beings who live in the real world that comprises of all different things. It is inevitable that even the most abstract of ideas in one field should have the slightest association to another idea most likely in another field. Since these can be linked in some way or another, it is apparently condusive to know other fields in order to see these links and perhaps also to better the field of specialization.

Another advantage of a broad knowledge span is different approaches and perspectives to viewing a problem. Different academic areas implement different ways of thinking about problems. For example, maths mainly adopts logic and reasoning, while literature may use a more elegant and artistic style to viewing the world. Realizing this should make a person more flexible in solving problems in general and better understand the things around us, or concepts in his field of specialization, in multiple perspectives.

The above re-emphasizes the fact that single specialization is not desirable."
5961,0,"I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.
From my point of view it is very important to have people within a society who try to do new things. This is especially important when it comes to innovation. Up to now there would not be any automobile or plain if people did not try to do new things allthough these things were connected to high risks. On the one hand society needs inventions but on the other hand you need to have a look at the risks aswell. Regarding Albert Einstein and his inventions everybody would agree that he created huge value for our society. On the other hand the question must be raised if nuclear weapons existed today if he would not have been that innovative.
As most people are part or member of a community or a company,
I would like to focus my answer to the strategic management of a company within a highly competitive market. From my point of view the only possibility to be successful and to create sustainability is to be innovative and to have innovative employees. Of course there are a few companies staying in the market by focussing on their key competences and by ""doing what they already know how to do well"" but to become ""successful"" as mentioned in the question you have to be innovative. Of course one could say that a company focussing on only one well known activity does not have any risk but from my point of view  the risk is to get kicked out of the market by another very innovative company.
There is a famous statement referring to the strategic management of a company and its employees which can be used for all other people as well: ""Often it is more important to do the right things than to do things right"". I draw the conclusion that people trying new things are successful allthough they must be aware of the risks."
4993,0,"Being able to speak about everything, even just a little, is a very attracting idea. However, I disagree with the statement beside. In my opinion, if on one hand people knowing the main issues of many major topics can be useful, on the other hand we still need very qualified people in very specific fields. 

Particularly in politics, it is useful to have elected people who are able to take into account and to pay attention to a large panel of issues. Their role will be to look  at the pros and the cons and to decide. Someone who is working hard on a topic might become unable to keep a clear sight of the whole situation. He or she might be likely to support his or her point. I think that it is the same at a smaller level. In a firm or in an association for instance, a person with a large knowledge is important to drive the whole structure toward the right way trying to define consistent decisions.

However, we still need specialized employees and managers. Consequently, students who wants to get a very specific training are very useful as well. These people are the bases of many domains of our society  because they are able to give very precise specifics. When a manager or a director has to take a decision, he or she will ask advice to experts. If nobody was able to bring detailled answers, we zould live in a very syuperficial world.

In conclusion, I think that both are very useful"
9978,0,"I really do not agree with that statement. I have made a lot of travels with groups and alone and I have strong reasons to prefer hanging by myself.
	First of all, whenever you go somewhere with a group you have to move by the schedules that a tour guide or an agency already made for you. You are not free to get up at the time you want or visit other places than the expected ones. So, by the end of the trip you will never know if you really knew a new place or visited touristics sights.
	Secondly, people in groups do not usually show respect for each other. What is more, they are mainly formed by an agency than by particular interests. In this way, you are forced to hang around with people you might not choose to be specially a close friend. You have to wait, for example, to those who are always late and you lose time you have already paid on those waitings, besides your conversations never grow in deepness.
	I think travelling alone is much better. First of all, specially if you are on your holidays, you do not have to share or discuss your desitions with anybody. It happens to me last year, when I was on a group journey, that we were always arguing about what places to visit or even what to eat. On holidays, your are so tired of the whole year that arguing with someone exhaustes more than relaxes. 
	Thus, I like visiting places that most of the tourist not, for example museums, old buildings and cultural centres. Why should I spend my time visiting places I am not interested in or discussing my preferences with persons I know will not share them?"

In my openion, i think a person who do somethig dosen't give up which can call successful person. The successful people maybe a rich or scientice or a politican. For example,Bill Gaze, the most rich person in the world, I think it's a good  sample for people who seccessed. Bill, as we know he have a famous company Micosoft. Why bill can become richest in the world? I think it's about his attitude, he take risk of computer system Dos. In that times, no one know Window is much useful for people, and can change people life. But Bill saw. So,he become the most richer person in the world. According to the reporter lastly, he still the most rich guy in the world. Why? Why he can be the most rich guy so long. Because, he try new things. He not only take fouce on computer but also in TV games. For example, X-BOX. I think many person have hear about it, maybe you had play it. Bill, knows try new things and take risk. Therefor, he become a successful people. In this two sections, you can understand how important about try new things and take risks. So, if you want be a successful person, just do it."
6909,0,"My opinion is very simple...i think that is true,young people don't give enough time to helping their communities.
But i think that they aren't totaly guilty of this.
In many case the actions of a person born to the contest when they spent their life...
Family,school,frieds and tv and all of the things that a person do in the first part of his life will influence his personality.
The gift that a young people take to his life coach,are deeply wrong.It's true that people don't help enough their communities ,but is early true that  at the moment there isn't good examples to follow and so will become  everybody best person.
I know that there are many person that are more intersting to help everyone,but for me this person are early a small number.
I'am very intersting for this theme....really!!!
At the moment ,in fact, i work on a call center that help some students of my country that have family problems and thei don't have the possibility to explain their problem to anyone...

9717,0,"I think its true that most of the young people in an age of 20 bi 21 enjoy there live more than wsome old people in an age of 70 bi 75.  young poeple have all there power and don`t have to thin about there health an death. old poeple have not so much pwer and some are rearly frightend about theire death, so they life with thoughts all around there death and so they are not so happy like young people. But if somone is old but still hase enough power to do sports and if he will be happy too. When the person hase an religion and believes in an life after death, it would help him or her much not to think always about there death. So I think that young and old poeple could both be unhappy or happy in there lifes.  when I think about it I`m comming to the result that yuo can`t say that old people  don`t enjoy theire lif as much as young people do, its different from person to person. young people have more power than old poeple have but old people have seen more in theire lif than young people, learned more and know more.young poeple have more problems with love, school and selfconvedence and old people have more problems with death and staieng alone. Young people and old people enjoy there lifes otherwies. young people make more sport or go to the disco and dance, but old people can read and learn and have no work to do who says that they can`t enjoy that. i think you can`t say that young people enjoying ther lif more than old people do it i think if you  enjoy your lif or not is only on evryone himself. So if I want to enjoy my lif i`ll do it and when I`m old I`m the same person like now"
1138,0,"When people travel, peopple might have different preferences on the way to travel. I disagree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. I always like to travel with my plans. I believe that the travel planed by myself always makes the travel enjoyable due to three reasones. In the travel led by myself, it enables me to decide where I can visit, how long I can stay at the place, and managing those plans make me a great traveler. 
 As I travel to somewhere, I have to think where I better to go. If I want to have a great trip, I have to know some information of the place. It is not only about places, but also the weather, transportations and so forth. Through those process, I can decide the place to travel and the place will be based on my interests. That's why it might be one of reasones.
 During travel, there might happen something different things from my expectation. For example, the place, introduced in a travel magazine, might not be really beautiful place than I expected. If those accidents occured, I would arrange my plan for the trip. I might leave the place and move to next plan. In this sence, I can adjust my plan to the situations. Therefore, I might like freedom in my travel.
 With whole process to have a trip, I can learn a lot of things that I did not know. If I participate a travel with a tour guide, the tour guide will schedule everything. Although the travel with a tour guide might be easy and not necessary to plan a lot, I want to learn many information for the trip.
 By those three main reasones, I disagree to the opinion. In addition, I prefer a travel led by myself .o"

6942,0,"Evolution has prooven that, specialized organisms as well as organisms that have refraind form specializing have endured. Specialists were able to ensure their survival by fitting into a single vacant ecological gap in which they flourished. Unspecialized organism have to rely on their flexibility; and that is exactly their advantage. Because, they are not specialized and are dependent of their flexibility, they are more capable of adapting to a new situation. Oraganism that don't adapt die and eventually their entire species will become extinct. One can easily project that image on human fields of knowledge. Being able to build life decisions on a great base of knowledge is more profitable then being specialized in only one field be it an academic subject or set of ideas and values.
	Being able to adapt is of greatest necessity. It is part of everyone's everyday life, you adapt to the people you talk to, you adapt to the people you work with, and you even adapt to your own family. If you have been specialized in one field it would probably be the one of greatest interrest to you, this does not mean though that all the people around you shre your enthusiasm about the same subject, which means that one has to be able to talk about other mayor topics in life. Granted, being a professional specialized in something vital does serve one well in the modern world in sense of economical seccurity, but what good does it do when you posess omnipotet knowledge of one field but are incapable of seeing the conections to another? When the company, in which someone was the specialist for that and only that specific company's computer network, goes bankrupt, he is jobless.

508,0,"Have you ever seen a  movie that the cars ride not on the road, but in the sky? At least, most people have ever thought about the surprising situation. I agree the statement that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years. That's because science technology developes rapidly and  the air pollution is a crucial problem.

  First of all, science technology's  development is rapid. Today people can send a e-mail to others who line in other country. and they can go easily abroad in several times. So in twenty years, there will be more transpotation. then the use of cars is reduce. In this s
ense  the neumber of cars is declined.

  Next, the air polution is the main issue in terms of environment all over the world. Each country tries to reduce harm material. One solution is restriction that person don't allow drive. In Korea, new policy announce that a day of week don't have to drive. In case of my father don't drive in friday.

 In conclusion. in twenty years there will be fewer cars, Due to technology and air pollution."
3627,0,"I`m sure I can say I totally agree with the statement. In fact it`s the reason why I choose a course of degree that cover a lot of different subjects. 
I think one simple (but not so stupid, i suppose) reason is because studying a lot only one subject  can easily become very very boring. I can`t immagine to pass all the years of the college studying all the aspects and features of the same subjects over and over again. I`m sure that this way one will become a great expert of the subject, but i think in the end he could even begin to hate it, unless he is totally fond of it.
Another good reason to achieve some knowledge in at least more than one subject is that you can never know what life`s deserving to you. One question:  what if you can`t find a job that`s concerned with that subject you have studied? It means that you are really unlucky, but it could happen. One extended knowledge in only one subject means that probably you are very little competent in any of the other numberless subjects that exist. With an academic preparation that covers a lot of different subjects, you have at least medium-to-high skills in a greater number of them. So on your curriculum it`ll written that you have matched during your academic carreer a number of subjects, meaning you could more easily find a job in a variety of environments; after all, I think, you can achieve the real expertise in a field of knowledge only with the direct experience on the working place rather than with the academic studies. I think this is true at least for what concerns my biomedical engineering studies, I`m sure that the knowledge of chemistry, physics, mathematic, biology and medicine that I`m learning, although they`re not totally complete will help me in future finding a possible job in a number of biomedical applications."
10421,0,"I don't agree at all with the idea that a young generally enjoys life more than older people do. We usually think about youth as a golden period of our life where we experience many unforgettable moments while we tend to consider the final period of our existence as the most painful one. Nevertheless we have to consider also the other side of the coin as a young person usually faces many difficulties an older person doesn't deal with anymore. 

There are in my opinion three different kinds of problems you face in when you are young.

First of all, everything is brand new to a you. You pass through a lot of experiences you don't know how to deal with because you lack the required experience about it. This often creates fears and doubts that is quite difficult to cope with unless you get the help of an older knowledgable person. For instance the doubts faced for the choice of a university, a crucial step in  life, can be lived in a very negative way and can create a big sense of lack of direction.

Secondly there are many situations that during your life you experience several times thus getting used to them. But when you are young and you experience these situations for the first time you are much more sensible to them than a older person would be. A typical example is love. A young person usually suffers much more than a older one because of love relationships because they are not yet used to them while getting older you acquire the experience that allows you to suffer less.

In the end, when you are young you don't know yourself very well since you are not aware of your strengths and weaknesses. This can cause a serious lack of self-confidence that creates very unpleasant feelings and thoughts in ayoung person. When you get older, instead, you are aware of your successed and failures and you get no more disappointed by them."

I do not agree with the statement because he following reasons>  

 First of all in a laboral enviroment people specialized in one specific subject are more likely to be hired, because they have a bigger knowledge about the job what are they going to do. for example> when you have a cardiac desease you would prefer go to a cadiologist with a PHD to go to a doctor who know just a little of every desease because you do not know if he or she can help you.  

My second reason why is that is easier to know a little of lot of subjects than have a specialized knowledge about one subject, what I mean with this is that someone specialized in one subject can learn easier a little of lot of subjects than someone who has a broad kwnoledge of lot of subjects. for example> If I am specialized in a subject I can after start to read about diferent thing and learn aout it a little, while if I am someone who just know a little about some things i have to study very hard o have the specialized knowledge. 
 
In conclusion because a specialized is more required in a laboral enviroment than someone who just has a basic knowledge and because is easier o become in someone with a general knowledge I disagree  with the statement."
2228,0,"The statement raises an important issue of the modern society. I completely agree to this statement. It has been seen that as the society is progressing the interaction of youth with the society, that constitutes its proximity, is decreasing. This declining communication restrains them from taking the initiative of supporting their communities. 

With the advances in technology young people have started spending more time in playing with the devices that they treat as the sources of entertainment. Consider for example television and computer. If an option between watching television or doing some social work is given to a bunch of young people then most of them would choose to stay at home and watch some TV show rather than taking the pain of doing social work. These technological gadgets and sources that promises to amuse the user do very little to motivate them for any community help. Hence they never realize the need of involving themselves into any social help.

Moreover very little efforts are put into to make the young people realize about the responsibility of helping out the nation and community. Young people don't want to help their country because they can survive happily without doing that. 

Another reason that might supplement the above mentioned reason to spare very little time for the young people is the expectations of the family. Every family wants to see their children as a succesful person. Very few families would like to see them as a citizen who is trying hard to help his community. This combined with the vast variety of sources of entertainment pushes the youth into a vicious circle where he/she either spend his time trying to fulfill his dreams or relaxing after the long duration hard work.

These points explains the reasons for the unavailability of enough time with the young people. But this should not be a justification. The modern society, which we call the developed society, is actually abasing itself if we compare the behaviour of the today's youth with that of the previous generation."
5930,0,"In light of the ever-growing environmental concerns, such assumptions can not be completely dismissed. However, the reason behind such an assumption can be argued with sufficient evidence from both points of view. Using current statistics and general population trends, we can only predict what the future beholds. 

As illustrated by the rocketing oil prices around the globe, there is a dwindling supply of oil and gas. The cost of finding and processing these natural resources are rapidly increasing, much to consumers' concerns. In a typical economy, once the price of producing a good increases, the price of consuming that good will consquently increase. Ultimately, the prices might become too much for an average-wage family to keep up with. If such a trend continues, the world will possibly witness a marked reduction in the number of cars on the roads. Whether the dependancy on cars as a means of transport can be reduced remains unknown. 

On the other hand, the world is experiencing a colossal population growth. Currently, there are around six billion people occupying the planet, however the numbers are expected to significantly rise in the near future. Logically, if more people are present then more cars are going to be required to transport them. An argument often made against that is that public transport methods, such as buses, trains etc... will be utilised more efficiently in order to mass transport large amounts of people at any one time. However, will people compensate their comfort and personal space in order to reduce the number of cars? 

Finally, many environmentalists are undertaking massive public awareness campaigns on the ill-affects of excessive car use. This could lead to governmental legistlations on the number of cars per family or similar restriction laws. In effect, this will definitely reduce the number of cars but will consequently leave many people unhappy. 

As displayed, one can only make predictions on population activity, especially when it involves large populations' activity. If I was to predict using the evidence at hand, I believe that such a statement will prove to be invalid and overly ambitious."
1860,0,"I think the products we see on TV ads, newspapers, magazines and billboards are usually exegerrated, but this is the point of an advertisment, to make us believe that we really need that product or that product will solve all of our problems about whatever that product is for. This is basically the heart of the capitalism.

	One of the examples of  overrated products is the fitness tools, which promise the consumers to have bigger muscles or to lose weight. These ads want us to desire to be like the people we see on these ads and then they convince us that we can be exactly like them if we buy their product, as if that product magically transform us into the person we want to be. The trick they usually use is to show photos of people before and after they used their product but these photos are often fake ones.

	Another example for the misleadind advertisements can be the ads that try to convince consumers that their product will change our lives in many ways. This time the trick they use is putting a lot of meaning to one item like that product defines who we are, who our friends are, etc.

	As a conclusion, advertisements and are used for two purposes by companies, to make us desperately desire their products and to cover a really bad product."
397,0,"I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts - at least at university level.

Having studied law in both England and in France, I have had the chance to compare two very different legal systems and more importantly, two different approaches to education, especially to the teaching of law. 

Studying law at university in England typically takes three years. After three years of undergraduate studies, students obtain their ""LL.B. degree"". It is also possible for students who have studied something else during their undergraduate studies to take a one-year-conversion course and obtain the equivalent of the LL.B. degree. The three-year period of time is relatively short compared with the study time that is required of law students on the European continent, for instance five years in Belgium and Spain, four years in France etc. The one-year-conversion course also seems to be a tremedously flexible alternative to the many years of studying law that are required on this side of the Channel.

This is a good illustration of diverging points of view on  the question whether it is more important that students understand ideas and concepts or learn facts.

Indeed, in British universities, emphasis is put on reasoning. Professors and students gather to discuss different topics, argue, give pros and cons... all for the sake of discussion and developing a critical sense. It is believed that students will not be able to learn all the facts and memorize all the laws and/or jurisprudence so the focus remains on understanding the reasoning and legal concepts.

On the Continent however, universities focus much more on teaching students something ""substantial"" and to that end, students need to memorize a lot of material which serves as the basis of their reasoning.

To conclude, I would say that having experienced both systems, I found the British approach more constructive. It could be compared to teaching a man how to fish instead of giving him a fish."
4266,0,"The issue at hand is wheter young people work enough for their communities. This issue is important because working for the community helps to develop social skills. I believe that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. 

First, young people nowadays are more interested in having fun than in helping their communities. For example, young people like doing a lot of sports or going out with friends. Beside these  activities, there is no more time for community work. 

Second, young people have to work hard in their jobs. The competition has become harder and harder. To keep your job, you have to be focused on it completely. Community work would keep you away from your work. Many of the young people avoid this kind of activity for this reason. 

Thrid, many of the young people are a little bit selfish nowadays. John F. Kennedy said once: ""You don't have to ask what your nation can do for you, you have to ask what you can do for your nation!"" Unfortunately, a lot of young people are more interested what they can get from the society rather than contribute themselves to the positive development of their community. A good example for the changing attidtude towards community work is the Swiss army: By law, every Swiss man has to join the army. But, in fact, more than 40 % of the young men are released from military service. Many of them just do not want do military service because it is inconvenient. 

Finally, the image of the community work has changed in the last few years. Whereas in earlier times people working for the communities were regarded as very respectful members of the society, a lot of people are laughing at them nowadays. Today it is much more important to have a lot of money and to be very succesful in the job. 

To sum up, I believe that the young people nowadays do not help enough their communities. There are different reasons for that, as I mentioned, but I do not think this development"
1099,0,"Even though it is quite important for students to learn facts as well as ideas and concepts, I would like to insist on the importance to understand ideas and concepts before analyze facts because otherwise students cannot keep right on truck. There are a couple of reasons why I emphasize for students to study ideas and concepts first. One is the fact that studying ideas and concepts first would work for students to learn facts efficiently. The other is the fact that learning fact does not make sense without a study from any perspective based on concrete ideas and concepts. 
First, if students understood ideas and concepts before learning facts, they could apply thier knowledge to focus on what the essence of the facts is and how those facts occur. This is one of the most important ability for students to learn in univerisity. They can not analyze any fact without fandamental ideas and concepts. For example, students can understand economic phenomena much more effectively with a number of concepts than without them.
Second, facts themselves do not make sense without any background infomation. If students did not study ideas and concepts at all, they would understand facts as just what happens at that time. However, they need study ideas and concepts to understand facts from different points of view. For example, when terrorists attacked buildings in New York , some people might say that it was totally Isram's fault while the others say the United States is also contribute to this incident.
In sumarry, students should understand ideas and concepts deeply before they learn and judge the facts. Although it was not really easy for them to study ideas and concepts because sometimes those concepts are very complicated, they still do this because facts do not make sense without any basic ideas and concepts."

In these advertisements, the companies generally try the best thing for themselves, they try to find ways in which they could make people buy their products to get their products sold and make a high profit from the business.

The purpose  of advertisements is first to inform the possible consumers of the product and secondly to make them buy their product instead of the products of other companies if present. The information about the product should be well-prepared in oder to sell much of them. However, in most advertisements, the products seem much better than they really are. This fact should be anticipated because people buy things of which they think it is the better one for their needs. Being aware of this natural fact, the companies advertise their products in a way that they look better than their actual qualities. 


Advertising a product in a way that it is shown in better quality than it really is might have also bad affects for the companies' reputation. The real fact about the product in poor quality may prevail in the general public leading to lower purchase rates for other later products of the company. The companies should balance the misinformation they give about their products in advertisements by considering the fact that it may eventually result in failure in their future business. 

To conclude, in most advertisements the products are shown to be in a much better quality to attract consumers attention to them. This is normal from the perspective of the companies, since they want to have products which are sold much."
7823,0,"Everyday in our lives we can see products' advertisements and spots almost everywhere we go. They are specifically studied to attract us, to steal our attention, thus making us think about them even for few seconds, even if we don't need what they are advertising. To do so they have to be direct,  colorful, funny. Everything they are advertising must appear beautifull, amazing, of great use or even really tastefull. So yes, I basically agree with the statement, and we can often have evidence of it.
For example - a really common one - we see on tv or on a paper something advertising something to eat, it seems wonderfull, hot, tasty and it also has a low price! I have at least to try it. When we go to buy it, we can see it is half the size it seemed and it is not even that tasty. Advertisements can influence a lot your thoughts. Not to talk about kids. If they see a toy on tv, it's shown colorfull and huge. They NEED to buy it. 
What I said works the best with foods, toys, something uncommon or that we don't usually see. Items used in our everyday life cannot be shown to much better than they are, because we know them, we know how they work and what they can and cannot do.
The base idea to advertise something is to make it appear fantastic. If you want to sell it it MUST appear fantastic. To do so it can seem even better than it is."
10812,0,"Understanding is an important aspect of the student education nowadays. It is very important to understand ideas and concepts that should help the students to be aware on its subject.

In some areas in the world and at a certain level of the education, student learn facts and do not try to understand the topic. This has a great consequences on the ability of students to express themsleves on any topic. Understanding concepts and ideas help students to implement the ideas and concepts they understood by trying to make realistic as possible. In the same way, students ability to to think is reinforced and their critical point of view would arise. For instance, when we explain a concept to a student and then we ask him to use that concept in his real life experience, he would be able to do it perfectly and at the moment we are sure that he understood instead of just learning the fact given by a teacher in class. 
Furthermore, a student who understands ideas and concepts should be able to give his own point of view in different manners. 

Based on my own experience I encooutered some students that learn facts and are not able when you ask them thinking question related on that topic to answer correctly. One day I helped a student to learn his biology lesson on root systems, they learned that are two types of root systems. I asked him to give me the difference between those types and I was amazed because he was not able to do that, but when I asked him to give me the two different types he started to give me all the writings of his notebook; this means that the student did not try to understand but only learning.

In conclusion, based on my explanation and support above mentioned, I agree with the statement that It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts."
9803,0,"I think that to learn ideas and concepts it is ok but until some point because what would happend if i have a lot of knowledge and i dont know when or how to use it, in the other hand we just cant only know facts because if  we just  know facts but if we dont have any idea or concept of how to use it, we have nothing. For example if a doctor knows all the concepts and the ideas you have to know about medicine and human body but never works with a person or does a surgery on his own when he finally have a person in front of him waiting for a surgery he probably be nervous because he have never done a surgery before, but if the same doctor insted of all the knowledge have been in surgery rooms all the time probably when he have to do a surgery on his own he would know what to do but dont know why he is doing it because he doesnt have the ideas  or concepts. But if the same doctor have a previous expirience with people and some ideas and concepts he can do a surgery completely sure of what he is doing without the fear if he is doing something wrong. Personally I disagree with he preview statement that ideas and concept are more important that facts for the examples i given."
6385,0,"Broading kowledge of many academic subjects is much better than specializing in one specific subject in my opinion. Not only because it will be more interesting but also because people will benifit more if the subejects are varied.

          The main reason that broading knowledge is more helpful is that people will be aware of many things in this world. they can expand their knowledge in an easy way too. If the subjects are limited, a lot of people wont care to know about other things in the world or in the kingdom which we live in. They will be satisfied to have the informations that are circuld around the environment they live in. I cant judge and say that all people will have poor knowledge, but i'm sure that the majority wont have that good knowledge. In other words, our society will be weak.

          Also if knowledge is limited to omly one subject, scientist wouldn't have reached the success which they have today. For example, if Nuoten didn't bother to expand his research on the gravity and stayed on figuring out why the apple had fallen toward the ground, i don't think he would have known the formula of gravity at all. he could have spend his whole life thinking alone and not knowing the reason of gravity. I think that his effort in studying every single detail made him conclude the concept of gravity. 

         If i were given the choice in any university or in any school whether to study only my major or have additional subjects, i would choose to study both my major and other additional subjects. that way i will be not only well educated but also my mind will have a good understanding of the world which i'm living in."

Actually I need to find solutions for an Asset Management company, which needs advise how to go on with their back office system. When I first met the COO he told me and my collegues to calculate a business case for his idea to centralize the back office business. This is my first job and so I have never done something like this before in university, but I learned some facts about the aspects a business case has to contain in my finance classes. So it was possible for me to take that challange. 
What I want to mention with this short story is, that you need both things in your daily life. On the one hand you need to understand the ideas and concepts the professors shows you, on the other hand it is also very important to learn facts, a kind of vobaburaly, to understand and deal with these ideas and concepts. 
At the university you first have to learn facts. It ist neccessary, not only in the field of business administration, also in natural sciences or other subjects. Without facts students would have no basis to discuss about. Everybody would understand a topic in another way and a comparison would be impossible. 
Facts build the basis on which you can set up walls, in this case, ideas an concepts. At the end you can build up the roof of the house. That means, the student can use all the facts and ideas he learned in a hole on a new topic. 
In your daily life you need the problem-solving competency to deal with different tasks you get. This competency you can only reach when you understand different types of concepts. So it is important to understand ideas.

7672,0,"In my personal opinion young people do not spend enough time helping their communities when it is needed. Our personal goals focus on ourselves whereas others generation's goals focused on community. there may be many reasons why this change came upon us, however, I guess the most important one is related to this our new style of life. Our way of life push us to worry about personal things rather than global ones. We care about our personal image, our personal grants and our personal skills. We have to. However we must try to change and we ought to realize what it is happening outside and in fact we should give our helping hand.Anyway, I think young people are no blame of this kind of selfishness but they are unaware. 

First of all, we have adquire a new way of life. We do live comfortable. Our parents usually provide us everything we need. Everywhere it seems as if nobody needs anything from us as long. Our community is rich and everyone can reach a good position as long as this person works. Thus, our goal is not related to our community in which everything runs ""perfectly well"" but it is focused in ourselves. Our own complains and artificial needs are highlighted. We have to be perfect not just good, but perfect. We have to worry about such things in order to survived in this ""ideal community"".
Inasmuch as we are so worried about ourselves we are not able to see the problems our community has, we are not aware of that.

Regarding this lack of awareness we can explain why we do not help but we can not avoid trying people realize their selfishness. We have to take a look over our reality. We must do more for our community than we are doing up to now. It is a good chance not only for the community but for us to grow"
9662,0,"I like listen to my father's story about his friend. He has own company and succeed ,but I think his personality is kind of strange, in other word, he is an adventourous person. He likes to go different places and buy new things. I thought he is a just rich person and wastes his money for fun; however, my thought was wrong. He is experiencing new things and planning what is next his project. From my experience, I believe that successful people try new things and take risks.
	Trying new things gives new idea while they are doing. If people don not try new things, they cannot have creative or intersting ideas. I think that from several experiences we can extend our knowledege and perspective wildly.Successful people go to a lot of different places and experince; therefore, they can inspire new ideas.
	Taking risks might be big damege, but from risk, people can learn what is a problem or weakness. Somethimes people need to fail from something because they can notice what is it wrong, but if they keep their rotuine and not try anything, they even cannot see new solution or ideas. For example, reserching costs a large amount of money, especially abroad, but this can be big asset after they success. So, people should not to afraid so much to take risks.
	Successful people have interesting personality. If people are doing the same things, their brain would be hard and cannot see other possiblities like stubborn. 
	In conclusion, I think that when people are success, they are interesting and intelligent people because of their challenge: trying new things, not being afraid of taking risks. So, I think that thier careea reflects their personality like enjoyable and rich personality."
8251,0,"People's personalities differ between each other , and so do their sklls and habits. What one person maybe bad at could be another's field of experties. The human nature drives to explore what is un explored, to experience what is unexperienced. We try new things and take risks every day at home, at work ,and among our friends , to find ourselves and to improve our charectors, and that is what create successful people. 

	Trying different things improves our charector. You may try different recipes for dinner, recipes you had never tried before, making mixs your self. That, for example, improves your taste and creativity. It makes you experince things you thought never existed. When you choose to start your own business but fear the loss, going on with your plans builds up confidence in you. When you travel by an airplance ,eventhough you fear it, that gives you courge. All the choices we make, all the experinces we have builds who we are and defines us.

	Sometimes we are lost, don't kmow who we are or what we were ment to do and be. Whether we were ment to be NBA stars or business managers, Holloywood star or a priest in a churich. We never know untill we try what we still have not tried. We are defined by what we do and how we do it and if we limit what we have done we will never have the nerve to do what we want to do.

	We are good at what we already know, but are we at what we never tried? That is the thin line that differs seccessful people from those who are not. We live in boxes that limit our way of thinking, and unless we relieze it, we will never get to where we want to be, will never achieve what we have always wanted to achieve--greatness and success."
1024,0,"In general, to be successful, many people takes risks. But in my point of veiw, it is better to do what one really knows to become successful for two main reasons. Low percentage of failing, and a better chance of developing the thing that one really knows well about.

	First of all, if one take a risk on doing something, there is a high percentage of failing it. By contrast, if you know what you are doing and work on it by researching and getting new imformations about it, although you might fail, it is more likely to succeed than doing what you don't know by taking risks.

	Second, if you do something that you have no idea what it is about, there is a low chance of being successful. But a person who knows the subject that he or she is dealing with could use the knowledge they have to develope the old one they already know about to a better one. For example, when I was11, my science teacher at school told me to do an experiment about electricity. At that time, I had know idea what it was about and had a lot of difficulty even choosing a topic for my experiment. I eventually did poorly on the experiment. But in the experiment I did next year was successful because I knew about the subject that I had to do a project with.

	In conclusion, rather than taking risks, it is better to do things that you know about to increase the percentage of being successful and have a better chance to develope a new thing and become successful in life."

1059,0,"I  agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do. It is the stage i think, is more comfortable to enjoy our living.
             I feel so because it is practically noticed that young one's have lot of zeal in them which makes them more active.The young people work hard for heir future and at times never let their enjoyment go down.For example consider a student who plans to pass in distinction in the annual examination. For achiving this the student works hard the whole year,apart from this the student doen't miss any other activities that involve enjoyment.
             Young  stage is the only stage where we can do anything as we can, no matter wheather it is right or  wrong. It is the period where things which cant be done when we become older can be done without any hesitation.
              They do what ever they want to do so that they can enjoy up to the maximum. For example they can dance, swim,play with the friends,roam here and there,can eat all the stuff which they want to,go for racing,can go for a challenge,involve themselves in entertaining programs etc.
               On the other part they can enjoy doing what ever their interest is in. Like  in research field,software, where they can makeup their mind set accordingly.
               Last but not the least i deal with the facts that everyone knows that the young stage is the most preferable stage where everyone finds it interesting when compared to other stages in our life .
            Lastly i conclude saying that the young people enjoy life more than older do."
2400,0,"Today, many older people  tend to travel all around the world, live in abroad, enjoy their hobbies, going to older people's school for talking and playing with same age people after retiring their jobs.  Thus, I disagree with this statement ""Youn people enjoy life more than older people do.""  
  Many travel companies tend to make travel plans and long-stay in abroad plans for only older people these days.  For example, my parents are thinking of traveling all around the world and  living in abroad to relax and enjoy their rest of life after retiring their jobs.  My university teacher has been talking same kind of things.  In addition, I know some older people who live in abroad.  I agree with their thinking because they have worked very hard and have not seen the whole world.  Older people can have a lot of free time to enjoy their hobbies.  They do not need to care about time.
  Thinking about young people, they also have free time when they are students.  During going to school, they can travel, study about their interests, stick to their hobbies.  However, after graduating school, they need to work and they have much less free time.
  Thus, I think older people enjoy life same as young people do.  Or might enjoy more than young people becuase they do not need to anything.  In my opinion, I would like to enjoy retired life, but I would like to enjoy more when I am young.  This is because to get a job which i want to do, and to get a happy life, i need to see the world by own my eyes.  Traveling around the world is very fun to me, and this would also benefit my future.  By the way, I really hope that my parents would have very enjoyable life after retire."
5971,0,"There are several reasons why I think  that young people nowadays give enough time to help their community, most of them based in my own personal experience, that makes me completely disagree with the statement setted.

In first place, we have to distinguish between periodic help to the community and flunctuant help to the community. The first one is help of young people almost in a weekly basis and with a very high grade of compromise. The second one is help given when certain natural disasters such as tsunamis or floodings arise.

Looking back throughout what I have been witnessing in this particular topic during the last 10 years, it is pretty clear for me that young people are involved in their community in a periodic basis. Just a small example of this may be a program hold in my University which consists on young people living with old people who live alone and need help. Of course there is an advantage for the young people from the program such as not having to pay a rent, but the really important thing of this program is that they are helping the community, helping the old people, helping their families and in general, helping society to become much more involucrated in the needs of the community. 

There are also many examples of non periodic help such as those of natural disasters. When that happens you always see plenty of young people moving to get food or clothes but not only in their own countries, but also moving themselves to wherever the disaster has occurred. An example of this is the Tsunami held in Asia a couple of years ago, again in my university, you could see every single student organization moving in order to get money, food, clothes or medicines.

So, to sum up and as I have argued before, young people make lots of efforts to help their communities and they really give many of their free time to help others."
10839,0,"To begin with, I do not agree with the statement which is exposed. To my mind, I think that students must understand ideas and concepts (absolutely) because it's a way for them to mature, and also learn facts. On the one hand, when they understand ideas they can afford exposing their opinions. The best solution to it is to attend school because it's a good way to attend different types of class and to understand different things from each one. The fact of speaking with students can make one's view. Going to school allow you to ask questions to professors if you don't know something or don't understand something. For example a student who used to believing that Doctor Kelly commited suicide and whose profesor explains him the real causes of his death will be more efficient after because he understands something. On the other hand it's really important on a student's life to learn facts. Indeed, the best solution to learn facts is to be confronted by. You can read magazines, watch television, surf on the Internet, in a word to put forward with times. When the unbelievable War in Iraq was declared and when people seen all that happened in this country, they learned something : violence is not the best solution to solve a problem. Besides, someone who is closed to his parents and doesn't cope with the exterior will not be able to face situations and to leave the family nest, he will not stand on his own two feet. That's why he had to read, listen or everything else that can help him to know what happen in the world and in that way learn facts. Anyway it's better if you are open-minded and not narrow-minded with the world's facts.
To sum up understand ideas and concepts are as important as learn facts because it not ban you of having a different vision and opinion of things, and it allows you to create your own personnality."
12012,0,"The education is more and more important to everyone in the world now, but different people have different pointviews on what is more important for the students. Some people think that understand the ideas is more important, but there is also a group of people thinks that it shoun't be like that, learn facts is more important than understanding ideas. I, however, believe that we should pay more attention on learn facts than understand ideas. because the reasons below.

The first reason, the most important one, the ideas are coming from the facts and the facts is helping us to understand the idea better. Here is an example, when we take the Physics classes, we always do a lot of labs, for what? To get the facts, then by these facts, we get the ideas by ourselves, then because we got the ideas by ourself, we understand these ideas much deeper than just learned from the teacher. And also, the facts is helping us to understand the ideas much quicker. As an example, if you want to learn swimming, do you think is it going to be learnning it quickier by just get the idea? Or you go inside the water, then you learned how to swim? Of course should be the second way.

Then the second reason, ideas sometimes get wrong, but how do you know? Without the facts, you never know. Like in the past time, there is a idea about if two objects dropped from the same height, then the one got greater mass would hit the ground first. but then a scientist don't think so, so he did a lab, he went on a tower and dropped two object with different masses at same height, but these two objests hit the group at the same time, so that means the idea said higher mass hit the ground first is wrong. So we see, without the exam by the facts, you never know the idea is right or not.

Well, from the reasons above, we can say that, learning facts is important than understand ideas, no facts, no ideas, even we got the idea without the facts, you might get the wrong idea. So I agree with the idea that pay more attention on learn facts."
11552,0,"TO BE SUCCESSFULL

In my opinion succes is not same for all people.It can change in which are it is gained and people have different feelings about the area which they are successfull in.However ; for me it is true that successfull people can do the best while they are trying new things and if they take risk  although the area which the success is gained changes from person to person.This is true because of three reason.

First of all , successfull people used to working and studying and they wonder what happened around them.Thus , they try different things which they wonder.For instance, the engineers of a big company always try to find new products to sell.In other saying,the company is big because of successfull engineers.The engineers are successfull because they are not doing the usual work in company.They are trying to find new areas which they are not already know how to do well.

Secondly, successfulll people are interested in everything.They read different kinds of books,they watch different types of programms and as a result of this , they know so much about different ares.So they can find varios type of innovations.If we look at the researches in the world,people who have different looking to the problems or the events are generally successful in their job.

Thirdly,successful people try to solve problems with different solutions.The person who has a second solution for a problem usually successfull.This is because of  their decides.A person who has a second or third solution means that he or she can take risk at least one time to solve the problem.

Take what I have  mentioned above into consideration, success comes with trying new things,with interested in different areas and with taking risk."

A person having broder knowledge will serve better for sometimes because the things he learned from one subject can be carried over to other.He can easily relate things since he already been this.

But If Someone who really serious about there carrers,will choose to Master a specific Subject than going through all the subjects.In this way he will develop his Interest and there by he can carry on this,He can do Reaserch on wht he has selected, there by He can give new Dimensions to theold traditnal way. It will also help him, in his carrer where he can earn more than others do because he has more knowledge about that subject and because he can do things in more Efficient way.

Consentrating One one Subject also reduces the Confusion and he can see what he want in more Precised way.Lets Consider A a Academic student of higher school,he has more subjects to learn then Student Who is doing Masters. But he has that knowledge in limited spetrum.

Where as Student of Graduation or PG. will learn or Concentrate on One Particular Subject ,and he gets thorugh knowledge of waht is happened,what is happeining and what wiil be?

Student on completion wil get highly paid jobs,in his field rather one doesn't have  more specific knowledge.Students should concentare on specific sbject which will lead to more practicallity of applying things.

Mastering Specific Subject will lead to more application of what is been learned all these years.It will also develop Students attitude towards that subject will inturn gets huge benefits.

So,In my Opinion Student should have basic knowledge all the subjects but He should Have more Knowledge on Specific Subject which will serve him better and his Society."
5619,0,"I feel that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to speacialize in one subject.The current era is changing and developing fast.It is growing at a rapid pace and in this changing world,one needs to have information about everything and almost every field.I think that in this changing era,one has to have the knowledge of almost every topic and field.

Human being is a social animal.He lives in a society where he meets several people from different streams.If he doesnt have any idea about other fields he cant even to talk to the persons he meets.He needs to have knowledge about the various streams.

For example MAHATAMA GANDHI,a lawyer by profession had a diverse knowledge about various subjects.He was an excellent speaker,great dramatist and a great poet.He used all these skills to guide India to indepence.WIthout the knowledge of these subjects he could not have guidd India to indepence.

One must have a broad knowledge of almost every subject.This is not only helpful in professional work , but also important for personal life.For example knowledge of geography can help one plan a vacation to an exotic location.Physics is used in our daily lives.Chemistry can be really useful to one.One can undersatnd the politics better.One can understand politics better if he has a knowledge of it.

I support this opinion that knowledge of many academic subjects is better than knowledge of one specialized subject."
5376,0,"Global warming, cold, the ozone layer becoming thinner...etc. What do you think is causing these problems? Yes. It's mostly because of cars. We all know that cars are polluting environment and causes many diseases . And yet, we're still using cars very often. Why? It's because it's fast and comfortable when it takes us to our destination.
I disagree that there will be fewer cars 20 years later. In my opinion, even the time goes to 2026, the cars will still be our number one trasportion. There are some reasons why I think this way.
  First, cars are very fast. It's much fast than running and walking and biking. Even though there are buses and trains, it's crowdy and also too big and slow for us to use for our daily lives. But cars are different. It's fast and comfortable. It can took us to the destination in short period of time. Unless we can invent transportation which is as fast and comfortalble as car, I think we will still use car in 2026.
  Second, cars are private for one or one's family. You can't really talk private things in the bus and train because it can annoy people around you . Also, you can't really talk privately since there are many people listening. However, in car, you can talk freely since there are only your mate or your family in the space. Not to mention that you can use car anytime you want.
  Third, cars have unique design. Some rich people even collect many  cars. Unlike other transportation, you can decorate your car in what fassion or color you like because it's quite small and cheaper than the other transportation. Nowadays, as technology developed, you can also do many things in car. For example, you can listen to music, watch TV, cook some food, etc. I think even the time flows 20 years, we will still can't find transportation like cars, which has unique design and many uses.
  I think cars are great transportation to humans  even though time flows to 2026. But,  polluting the environment got to be stopped. Many scientists are developing new ways to find resourses, such as solar energy, wind energy, tide energy and so on. I hope to see a wonderful car without polluting air in 2026."

       A car can effectively work for Maximum of fifteen years, after fifteen years most of the parts in the car would be torn out and the efficiency of car decreases, even if the car is used beyond fifteen years it may release hydrocarbons which may increase the polution . Most importantly our native government is taking to measure to implement the idea of using car for only fifteen years and after fifiten years the car has to sent back to the showroom ,or it has to be thoroughly checked to use it,so that the car used  will not increase the pollution.

             The demand for petroleum products have increased  significantly,to run any vehicle we require a petrol. Unfortunately we are running short of petroleum products.Due to scarcity of petrol the number of cars will be reduce as the middle class people may not offerd to pay such huge prices for petrol and maintain a car,

         Now a days the roads  which we use are congested because of traffic present .The number of vehicles are increasing daily, adding to the traffic problems .The traffic now a days is such congusted that we can reach our destination more quickly on foot rather tah using car.To have a smooth ride on our car we wish to have a spacious room t drive our car,but unfortunately there is a little chance to expand these roads.So people are finding differnt alternatives for their daily work.

             one of the most interesting aspect is problem of obesity in many people.The food habits and nutrients contents in the food had cjhanged a lot and  they have no time to do exercise to keep themselves fit and healthy.Cycling provides a good chance of exercise to the body and there is a hope that many people may switch to cycling in nearby futures for a short drive where they used cars before.
     
            I canconclude that the number of cars in the next twenty years will be fewer than cars in use today because of problems mentioned above. The main important problem for the reduction in numberof cars is the availabaility of petroleum products and health problems.Inorder to overcome these problems people may switch to various means of transportation reducing the number of cars used."
6638,0,"Methods of teaching are essential for the students to learn and understand things and apply those in real life. So it is important to choose which method shall be used. Indeed, students can be educated by helping them learning about the facts, but would it be enough? Since learning starts with comprehension the definition and essence of things, which are theoratical ideas and concepts.Addition to that, learning about ideas and concepts can improve the students' argumentative abilities, and lead them not rely on an only one truth. Regarding those, making the students learn things by facts does not seem to be an effective method.

Indeed the theoratical concepts can be boring for the students and may cause them to loose their focus. But in order to understand and comprehend something, they would need the know the definition and the essence of things. Learning facts can be practical but can never provide the sufficient information for the students.

Despite the fact that, learning about and studying on facts can help the students to overcome certain problems that they may encounter, these circumstances are limited. If a student's argumentative ability is not developed enough, then he or she may not able to use the potential creativity he or she has. Thus when students encounter events or issues that cannot be explained by a specific fact,  they cannot come up with different soultions since they would not know about the essence and the logic of the problem they encounter.

To conclude, although teaching the actual facts may contribute to students understanding and learning of things in life, it may help them to a limited extent. As long as they are not concerned the ideas and concepts, in other words, the essence and the logic of the things, they can neither develop a more creative and argumentative point of view nor can be successful enough in their future lives."
4328,0,"I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.   The modern trend of elitism, individualism, and  has robbed today's youth's knowledge of the inherent value in community service.
     In Korea, a nation that has thrived on the basis of human resources, the main source for one's economic success is one's ability to perform academically: thus the trend for elitism. The extreme competition in college admission and the strict education system that follows accounts for the fact that an average student spends at least five hours in an independent learning institution every day. It is no wonder why these students find no time for community service, save a time for personal leisure. As youths have been emersed in this merit-based society, they lost sight of the necessity to help the poor and helpless.  After all, if one were supposed to earn one's way to the top, then does not poverty and hunger stem from the incompetence and neglect of those who suffer?
     Individualism, a western thought that is now spreading world-wide, is another factor for the youths' neglect of community service. During the Industrial Revolution, communities that were bound together by economic niches began dissolving due to the development of  specialization. Families and neighborhoods that used to work together on communal farms were separated as they were employed by mass factories. Due to such a separation, the world today is becoming more and more self-centered and individualised. The young peoples' neglect of community service is only one manifestation of this phenomenon.
      In conclusion, the strive for economic success and individual gains have blinded the youths of today. We need to start recognizing that there is a greater calling out there in this world: love."
10430,0,"Different  people have different opinions abou this idea .In my opinion, I dissagree this idea . These days ,there are a lot of  different  kinds of advertisements make products seem to make money . I dissagree this idea because it is very important thing that weather tthe products quality is good or not .The other reason is that weather the products's company has a good survice .

   There are many companies use very popular advertisements to increase their products 's selling . But I  think that the most important thing that the products quality .If the products are very good and very useful ,I  believe that a lot of people will love them and they will buy them .After using this product and the product is really useful for this person ,she will tell her friends ,her parents and so on .It is possible that her friends and parents also buy them 

   The other reason  I think that  the products's company should have good survice to their customers .For example, when  the products are break or there are any problems to the products ,the company should be sure that the products can retire .And the company's workers  should explain their products very good to the custormers .Only in this way  that the customers may be buy the products .


  Actually , good advertisements are important to make  products seem but I believe that the products 's quality and the company's survice is more important than use good advertisements .People do not like too crazy advertisements ,they more like good quality of products .And also ,if the product are very cheap .it will  make the people happy to buy  it ."
2827,0,"The world is in permanent change and evolution therefore we should follow this evoluion in order to improve our life and knowledge. So there are some people who try new things and take risks rather than keeping the old methods even if they know very well how to use it. 

Personally i like to be different from the others, so i use all the time new techniques and methods. This new way to do is very important because it could be a source of success. To illustrate more what i am saying i have an example; last year i had my training at a small company exactly in the financial departement. What i discovered during my presence, at that firm, is that the financial staff does not use the technology in order to improve the quality of the work. They do not have a computer, imagine a company now in 2000s years and it does not have a computer. This causes a lot of problems to the company especially in analysing the daily situation of the company. so what i did is that i talked to my boss in order to buy some computers because they will improve the work and he will need less people. after a very long discussion he accepted to buy just one computer at the begining in order to test what i said. after one week he told me that his staff is very satisfied and they have now more time to do other important things rather then calculating some small operations.
but if you decide to work with news things you should accept to take risks but i think that is a very logical result. because you will use new methods and maybe new procedures that are not all the time good. so to solve this problem, i think that rsiks represent a part of our life especially if you decided to try things differently. but you should remember that when you take a lot risks you will win more. to illustrate that, i will tell you an example based especially on my life as a would a bussiness woman. when i invest more money at any project automatically  i think about the risk that i run. because it will be as hudge as the imprtance of the money i invetsed.
so to sum up i want to say that i agree with the statement simply because new methods and risks are a part of my professionnel life."

7500,0,"According to the reading passage successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well and i think that successful people should try new things beside doing what they already know how to do well.Because, when you try new things, you get to know some different things in your life, and it will give you a whole lot of new experience and you can have knowledge of different kinds of new ideas and techniques which, you can, implement in your actual business.As you are already a sucessful person,you do not have to bother about loss or any kind of disturbance in your business when you  try some thing new.And when you try some thing new you can effectively apply your previous ideas and experiences into it which you have gained from your routine business.
                             As you are a successful person you have more contacts and relations in the commercial market which you can use when you start a new business, as it gives you great chances of having a good start in the market.But if you are not successful, and you are new in the business feild then you have to deal with different problems like, you should have knowledge about few important business aspects like production, management, investment,marketing, and many other things which creates a lot of problems in future if they are not maintained properly.But if you are successful then you can use your previous experiences and intelligence.
                      But, if you want to try something new beside your previous business, then first you should consider in which feild you want to invest or which business you want to start.Before starting a new business you should thing about what you are investing in,whether it is proper to invest in a particular business rather, because it reduces the amount of risk you take whille trying something new."
1072,0,"The statement is In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.One group of people agree with this statement and one group of people donot agree with the statement.I find many reasons for not agreeing with the statement .I personally donot agree with the statement.

Yes,technology is developing day by day but this does not necessarily mean that there will be no cars in twenty years.This is unpredictable.Now a days people are working hard and are making their lives comfortable that is they are acquiring everything they need .What makes life more comfortable?the answer is having more luxuries and having more comforts.People are more concentrating on luxuries which includes mobiles for communication ,vehicles that is cars,bikes for transport ,own houses for living and so on.So people buy vehicles bikes ,scooters,cars etc.Most luxurious of all is Car.Not only luxurious ,it is safer than many other vehicles.So buying cars will definitely increase that is there will be many cars in use in twenty years .These reasons donot support with the statement.

secondly,people are trying to reach the goals above their standards.For example a person using a two wheeler vehicle ,even though it is hard for him to buy a car,keeps his goal of buying a car due to various reasons .Some of them are for avoiding pollution and accidents.They feel having a car is far better than having other vehicles.The main reason is Car is affordable.And moreover now a days cars with electric facilities ars available that is having gas engines .This is safer because it doesnot lead to pollution.Therefore, using cars is day by day increasing.

For all these reasons which are discussed above, i donot agree with the statement that fewer cars will be in use than there are today.I strongly believe that there will be no attrition in the use of cars in twenty years and there will be more number of cars in use than there are today in twenty years."
4576,0,"I do not agree with the statement. I don't think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. I'm not saying that it's not important to have a rich knowledge about different subjects, but to be succesfull in today's world, is essential to be extremely prepared about a specific subject.
An example can be a company that produces veichles.Today in the market there are a lot of companies that make veichles, so someone who studied how to produce veichles is not so different from many others. So that' s why is very important for this person to came out with a new veichle that can make a difference. And to do so he needs to focus on a specific subject. He needs to study more about a particolar caratheristcs that other veicle don't have to became more succesfull then the others on the market. For example it would be a good idea for this person to focus and specialize in only one kind of veichle, maybe he can focus only in SUVs. He can probably dedicates his studies in how to have a better gas/milage with these type of veichles. I drive an SUV and I'm sure that if he can do that he will be considered a god and the market of SUV will increase drastically! Anyone who studied about making veichles can find a job in the veichle production, but only who dedicate in a specific subject can be more succesfull than the rest and be on the top of the market.
This is only one on an infinity of example to explain why I think that it' s better to be specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects."
2616,0,"It is better to start with describing the successful people; they have an unlimited brain, they do not think like normal peoples and they are capable to get used to new conditions. After this description it is not possible to disagree the `Successful people try new things and take risks rather than doing twhat they alredy know how to do well` idea. `Taking risks makes money` and `More risk=more money` is accepted ideas in economy and this idea forces successful people  to go on doing something new.

Success is a sick, like using some illegal drugs, when you start overcoming some problems (we call it success) you need more to make yourself more successed. We can say it is not only making some money, it is trying to make(earn) ALL money in the world. That is why succeed people trying to give self-cofidence to their children than teaching some specific formulas. Successful people has an interesting risk management ability, at the same time this ability have made them successful.

Some unsuccessful people might be succeed, just one or two success are enough for them they can stop going ahead after creation is completed. We can call their success as luck. They know that it was their luck and they do not want to risk to loose everything they earned actually they can not do it. But really successful people, like in the statement, use their previous experience on next job and they know that they can do the next better.

I absulately agree that successful people can not be limited or stopped with just several successes. Also they agree that `doing what they already know how to do well` will kill their successful minds. Making more succes needs taking more risk idea is in their blood and these kind of people is not programmed to stop after a while."
2629,0,"I agree with the saying that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years. Altough private cars have played an impotany role in people's life nowadays and people tend to more depend on the use of the cars, I think this situation still will change a lot in the future twenty years.

Twenty years is not a very short time, it can mean that one generation have grown up and become the most dorminant people in the society. In many developing countries, the children nowadays have been taught more about the importance of  protecting our environment, otherwise mother nature will punish humankind for what they had done. So when these children become adults in like twenty years, they will do better than their parents in the aspect of environmantal protection. What is more, there is already a lot of events in both developing and developed countries that people automobally decrease the use of the private car. For example, I heard a lot of people in western countries nowadays always share their car with their collegues or classmates, or just take the bus instead of driving a car to decrease the waste from the car which will pollute the air in the city. And in China, there is also news about some elementary school students persuade their parents not to use car to send them to school, these parents then receive their suggestions and  use bicycle to pick their children. So we can see from these events that people have become more and more concern about their environment, this is why maybe the use of car will drop in the future.

Some other factors also can make changes in the use of car. First, the price of oil has become much more higher than before and continue to increase. Maybe many people in the future can not afford such high price and change their way of going outside. Second, there are also a lot of convienient public transportations in the city. Such like subway, bus, railroad. This kind of transportation is not expensive and can attain anywhere you want in the city, and especially the subway can not be influenced by the terrible traffic above them. It can save people a lot of time, and it is quiker than driving a private car. So, the high price of oil and the convinence of taking public transportation can make effort to the decrease of the use of cars in twenty years.

In conclusion, there are some reasons why there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. In my opinion, the most important is that people in the whole world can realize how serious that using too many cars can make our blue earth a dirty planet,."
6407,0,"I agree to the statement ""It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject."" Both idea seem great for me but if I have to chose eather one then I will chose broad knowledge of academic subject.
	Through our life we grouw up and learn a lot of different subject .  Having knowledge about one specific information is seem great but  in my pesonaly opinion having a lot  of different academic knowldege will bring lots of possibility in ,my future. Someone who want  to be enginier they just need to study math and scient, They are keep doing one job and become specialist. There is a lot of people who want to be a enginier and it is hard to be a one great specialist, and only few peopele can sucess and become specialist. In the other hand, when we know broad information about many acadeic subject then we have a lot of job to do. For example, if I become actrtess and I have knowledge of academic subject then I can etend my job a lot. At  fiest, I can sing well then I can be both acrtess and singer. Second, if I can speak foreign language then there will be chance to go other country to work. Either If I can speak english very well and there will be a chance to come out on the Hollywood movie or sing with some famous foreign singer togather  to procude CD and sell for both country. Third, if I am good at wirithg them I can publish the book or write song. If I have good appearence then I can  also be a model. In generally actress come out on comercial, magzine, movie, and some other thing base on own academic knowledge. 
	In my conclusion it is good to have board academic knowledge to extend our job for futuere."
2848,0,"''The world is a stage, and we are all players.'' As Shaekespear told, we are the players on this huge stage, who try to enjoy in their short life span. In this case young people are more lucky than older people because they have more life enrgy, and they did not see the bad side of life yet.

	My first reason is that the vivid energy of young people is higher than older people, for they have less responsibility.  The older people have to sustain their life themselves, and sometimes they have to look after the youngs. For example, older people have to work and gain money in order to get their basic life needs such as eating or housing. However, the young people do not have to gain money. They can get from their parents what they need. So, young people can use their all energy to enjoy the life, and they are more happy than older.  

	Furthermore, the young people do not have more experience than the older people, including the bad ones. The older people made mistakes in their past, and are afraid to do those mistakes again in their future. While they are preventing themselves from bad events, they miss the enjoyable things on world. On the other hand, the young people, who have less experience can move further steps in the enjoyful life, for they are not afraid doing the wrong thing. They even do not know what is wrong.  While old people are being stuck in their bad experiences, younger people live in the sunny side of the world.

	To sum up, being a young person I can say that the young people enjoy life more than older people do, because we are loaded with more energy to use for being happy, and we did not see yet the realities which makes people unhappy."
865,0,"Helping communities is a great thing to do and there are many people involved in this ""job"" with the aim of substaining and helping as much as they can. 
Usually this help comes from the curches and from the charity associations as a volunteers' occupation and it's very useful and gratefying. But if we look with more accurancy we can see that the people that works there, are usually middle age - old people that thing that spending more time there is better than wating time. So it's true that the young people don't do enough for their communieties.
Instead of staying hours in front of the computers waiting for something more interesting they should go out and do something useful and important for their communietes. It isn't an hard work.
For example, it means going to the church's playfield and help the mothers to control their children, help an old woman to buy her dinner at the supermarket or help an old man to take his dog out. Frankly it's nothing so difficult to do.
Personally I think that working in charity shops or helping people in difficult it's more gratefying than how they think. These stuations should help them to be more sensitive in front of these people but  especially to understand the importance of their occupation. This way a young boy/girl is going to face the real problems and the real situations that could happen during their lives. And I think that there is nothing better to be prepared about what could happen in the future."
7412,0,"I agree with the statement ""successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do it"".

The reason i agreed is beacause i think you can not make succes if they did what they already know haw to do. if YOU know how to do it, then other people would know as well.
you try new thing and that gives us the impact, maybe this is the way to be successful.

However i do not think you can succeed by randumly making new ideas. you do need to search on them, you need reason and proof to come up with the idea. Also you may need some help from other peolpe who has been through and experienced it.

For example president of clothes shop called UNIQLO. i think it is one of the most famous clothes shop in japan now days.
He made so many new project, and he actually tried. But failled so many times too. 
He presented to us mass producing. first of all, they started to making simple designed clothes and sold them with very cheep price. Before UNiQLO did this way of selling clothes, every one would of thought it was not very good idea of producing so many same designed, cheep, simple clothes. Because they thoght that costumers want to buy something more individual and good quality. 
However UNIQLO succeeded by selling products this way. 
But i have also seen them failling quite badly, that was when they started to selling vegetables and frite at the shop.
It was an very big impact on us too like the last time. what kind of clothes shop sell vegetable at the shop?
but it did not make a seccessful ending. they stopped selling it after few months. It made such a loss for the company.
But the president of UNIQLO still does not stop producing new ideas and project. that is why the company is still growing and making a lot of money.

i have come to the conclusion that i think even other people think you will not success with it and stop you, they can be wrong sometimes. you might fail a lot of times before you actually become a successful person. But that is the way to success so you should not be afraid, you need to take risk and try."
1858,0,"People can learn through different methods. Some have an easiness for remembering charts, pictures or other graphics while others learn faster by literal means. The quality of the retention of those facts varies according to the way they retain them.
     When a student understands the idea of what he is doing, he can implement observations of his own. When one understands something, it is much more probable to imply or discover the rest of the details. He may even add new ideas. Once you get the big picture of one concept and understand it, your mind can analyze it, judge it and compare it to former experiences. Understanding a concept makes it last much longer in the memory. We have a limited memorization time and space. For example, if you memorize your credit card number, you will remember it for a period of time. Once you stop using that number, the most probable thing is that you will forget it in a few months. Our memory works best when we put to practice concepts and understand their functions and structures.  
    On the other hand, simply learning facts leads to being able to hold back more details. You may know everything there is to know about a certain theme, but if you cannot understand it, you cannot change it or handle it. Think of it this way. Pretend you make a new friend. You may have read about this person before. You may know everything about him, from his blood type, to his hobbies, to his tastes, even his habits. If you do not understand the person, you cannot deal with him, or even maintain a lasting friendship. To truly know that person you must not only know about him, but also know him.
     To conclude, my opinion is that it is more important if you can understand rather than just retain facts. When you understand, you have the ability to change it, experiment it and even handle it. If the knowledge of a student is going to last him for a lifetime, the best way of remembering facts is to understand them."
1668,0,"I think understand ideas are important to students. What is the job of students? It is learning. Teacher have to teach students and students have to understand what teacher saying, but not every student understand what teacher lectured. Then, what should students do? First, they have to try to understand again by textbooks or notes and if they still did not get meaning from them then go to ask friends for help or ask teacher for help, and maybe they will understand what teacher taught at that time, but they still can not do some problems if they did not understand ideas.
     I took Math class before, and I can understand Math so I do not have any problem with that but I have some friends that they can not understand Math and I always taught them and they could do the problem at that time, but they could not do well with the tests. Why they could not do well with the test? I think it is because they do not get any idea from Math. They just understand how to do the problems when I teach them, but test will change the style and they will panic with that and they did not know how to solve it becuese they did not get the idea from Math so they could not do by themselves and if they did not get the idea, they never get good grade with Math so I taught them to understand idea. It was really difficult to do, but they got good grade at the end.
     In conclusion, I agree with the statement. I know it is really important to understand an idea, so it is the best to understand ideas, and when I study, I always try to understand what is it talks about and try to get the idea from the lecture."
11120,0,"I agree with that statement because of these reasons.
     At first, understanding ideas is really significant for students when they learn new study,  For example, when I was a high school student, I started learing physics.  I t was dificult for me to learn facts and formulas withought understanding ideas.  I could  remenber  facts, but I did not understand and put into long term memory.  However, when I was taught The idea of physics by my friend, I could understand.   I knew facts, so it was easy to accompany that idea and facts.  If I learned idea and concept first, I would remember important formulas and facts for a long time.  Thus, understanding concepts is more important for students.
     In addition. understanding ideas and concept is helpful to student.  When I took  'American government' class, the instructors explained meaningful concept of this class befor telling facts.  He introduced huge image of this corse, and he suggested ideas of each terms for this class.  I am an international student, and I was not used to American government, because his introduction was really helpful for me.  If he introduced just facts or facts, I would not get  importance of this class and be interested in American government.  Therefor students can take advantages by  understanding ideas and concepts.
     Although learning facts is also meaningful, it does not help students.  When students want to know something, learning facts is useful because they do not have to spend much time.  However, if they understand something, it does not function.  Understanding ideas and concepts does not mean only obtaining idea, but also learing facts.  
     In my opinion, understanding and learing are accompanied with each othere.  When students gain someting, they should understand that, and then they can learn facts deeply.  Thus, I agree this statement."
5830,0,"In my opinion young people enjoy life more than older people do. There are several reasons to explain my opinion. 

	Young people can enjoy life because they dont have responsibilities. They have more freedoom. They must go to school , do their homeworks and clean their rooms. But they have a lot of free time. They can spend it in different ways and have a lot of fun. They can meet many other friends to have fun together. 

	Old people have important responsibilities and they must work for their families or themself. They spend most of time at work . They can realize a dream or a hobby only during the week end or in the evening. Old people are more mature than young people because  they had many experencies during their life.

	In conclusion i think that young people can enjoy life more than older people do. To be a young people is beautiful. If you were a children , you could do what you prefer without problems. A children thinks nothing about serious events or facts. Old people are under stress or serious. Young people are always happy . Young people can enjoy life more then older people because they cant look at bad things or facts but only at good , pleaseant and beutiful things and events."
9900,0,"It is claimed that teenagers nowadays have less time to commit themselves to activities other than academic pursuits; they do not give enough time to helping their communities. However, I disagrees with the claim, as in the perspective of a young student, I still see a lot of young people squeeze out time to help their communities.
In my school, there are a lot of organized programmes for students to engage in to help their communities. We are offered precious opportunities to visit old folk homes and valuable chances to ask for donations for disabled children. I was also proud that I participated in activities for charity organisations to perform harmonica in public to gather donations from people. There are a lot of students who are also actively involved in community programmes to fulfill themselves and to contribute to society and their communities through whatever ways they can.
Last year, local universities stop to use Community Involvement Programme (CIP) as a criterion for admission of freshman applicant. The main reason is that the Ministry Of Education(MOE) wishes to discourage students from participating in community programmes for the sake of earning CIP hours, which was used as a criterion for university admission. However, after MOE has discarded the old system, there are still a lot of students who engage actively in community work, which is a testimony to the fact that most students are helping their communities to contribute to society not, for the sake of getting into a university. 
In addition, given the ample opportunities for yound people to help their communities, many have take advantage of the organized school activities to experience the real life of poor people. Nowadays, people are generally more affluent than before, but there are still a lot of unfortunate people who cannot escape from the vicious cycle of poverty. Thus, some students from wealthy families take advantage of their opportunity to go overseas to help poor people. In my school, there are organized programmes for students to travel to Thailand and other poor areas to help to teach the poor students who are deprived of the opportunity to learn in a comfotable classroom as we do. Every year, there are a lot of students who apply for the programme, to the extent that our school has to select students for the overseas trips. Many students are compelled to help the poor people. Those who are given the opportunity to travel abroad also ask for the whole school population to donate books and unused stationaries to the poverty stricken students. 
Therefore, in conclusion, despite the hectic schedules of comteporary young people, I still think that many youth sincerely wants to contribute to their communities and help to make the world a better place for all homo sapiens to live in, regardless of race, language or religion."
11203,0,"I agrre it. I think successful pelple tried new things and taked risks. Try is make a light of future. But some people get damage after tried, but I think all success pople got damage before success.They tried again and again and get success. 
 First of all, if you try to something and try to accomplish, you should get a lot of problem at the middle, but do not quit when you tired. because you have a lot of chances yet. New things did not try to everybody, so if you accomplish it, you could make a big future. 
 Second, look at the around who success people. They do not say get easy about success. They got a lot of wall and became a miserable then they became a rich or famous. 
 Third, new things could makes us huppy. Now, we have a lot of technology. For example, television, call phone, car, and micro chip that makes us better than long years ago. If we do not have them right now, we can not live in this world. In addition, thechnology is developing now too. 
 Im deed, I think we have to agree it, because you living and using in the new technology world, so it means that meny people tried and accomplish something. Why do not dissagree it? If you try to something, we could get a lot of new things than now."
3301,0,"I believe that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning only facts.  In my opinion, there are several reasons why ideas are more important than facts.  
For instance, while I was attending history course, which is  often believed to be made only of facts, I realized that some events are common in different periods. Therefore, when I was able to understand the ideas and concepts, I was also able  to catalog similar events in big caterogories and this way of learnig helped me in getting a good mark in the exam.  
Moreover, while I was attending the university I realized that the way of learning ideas and concepts is really imporant. 
For example, a course can explain with some examples how to deal with certain issues. However, it may occur that a different issues occurs so, I believe that only whether you understood the ideas you might solve this new issue.
An example, that confirmed that ideas and concepts are more important than facts, is  what happened last year during the electronic laboratory course. I and my friends were working on ""led"", light emitting diode, and we were measuring the emssion of the light. We were using a  particular instrument to get the measures  when it stopped to working. We were worried because we knew that was the only instrument to do that kind of measure. What is more we studied only how to use that kind of instrument and other types. Our professor told us that also it was impossible to repair it. We thought we lost all the experiment, but it was not true. While we were reading the the manual we understood that that istrument was only the combination of two well known instrument: a "" wave generator"" and "" amperometer "". We got the ideas. We were able to build our instrument and continue the experiment.  We were really happy of what we had done and we understood that the we were able to finish our experiment ony because of ablity to abstract ideas and concept that we had understood in the past."
5230,0,""" We should try everything as possible as many things before he become old."" My parents used to tell me since i was young. It means that we can not do everything ,which we want to do, when we become old, becasue old people can not have the power of life, eventhough they have exprienced knowledge and money. I aagree with the following statement. "" Young people enjoy life more than older peole do."" 
	Firstly, when we are young, we have the important things for living our life, such as power of life and youngness. Therefore, the two things can help us challeng and try everything in our life. In the news, sometimes we could hear about news that young people challenge something incredible or accomplish something. Few monthes age, i heard a news about handcapped group of peole challege to swim. And they finally accomplished their goal, such as making short time records. I believed that if we do not have the power of our life and youngness, we can out challenge and try to do everything. 
	Secondly, if we are young, we do not know abour fear. if could make us enjoying life more than older people. Usually, older people know fear of life well, becaseu they have much more expereices and hear about more happendings many times. Thus older people know more fear about everything. But, for young peole they are inexperienced about everything our life. Thus young peole do not have much fear than older people. We could see many examples world widely well, young people loves to try very wild and dangerous sports, such as sky diving and snow bording. When i went ski and snow bording place, i could see the 95 percent of snow border was youg people, who want to feel the danger and speed. Young people loves to feel fear and always want to challenge wildness in the world. 
	Lastly, eventhough older people usually have money, they can not evjoy their life than young people, becasue they think their future too much. Older people think about their future, death, family and other suff alot, becasue they know their responsibilities. But usually, for young people they do not think about theur future, job , family or other suff, becasue bascailly they have much time than older peole. Young people could do their stuffs in their future, but for older people, they do nopt have much time, so they have to spend their time more valuably. It always makes stoping older people enjoy their life. For my personal example, just next my house, there is one family. The family has old parents and two youg childrens. Since last year, they all wanted to go travel every places in the world, the all family tried to go travel, but only their two children could go travel, becasue when they were living travel, parenst were start thinking anout their time, money , future, and everythings. But their childrens did not thinkg about their suddroundings, and just decided to go travel, finally only their chidrlen could go travel. Older peole can not enjoy their life, becasue they care about their surroudning problems too much, espeicially time. 
	In other words, young people enjoy life more than older people do, becasue young people have the power of life and youngness, these two things make them challenging. Young people are unexperienced people, so they do not know the fear of life. Thus sometimes, they could be very brave. Lastly, everhtough older peole usually have much more money, h\they can not enjoy life, becasue they care about their surrounging problems, such as time."
7929,0,"Traffic in big cities continue to increase day by day and the ammount of cars on the streets are constantly rising.Some people think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.I agree with statement because of the rapid improvements in technology and because of the decrease in petrol resources throughout the whole world.

Traffic is a major problem in metropolitans.For example in my city there has been an incredible increase in the amount of traffic in the last years.Roads are nearly everywhere covering nearly one third of the cities landscape.There is nearly nowhere left where people can sit and enjoy the fresh weather, wherever people go in the city they smell the disturbing smell of petrol and chemical gases caused by cars.I think in the coming years governments will consider this as a great problem and they will start finding solutions to this car problem.In my opinion technology will be their biggest aid in decreasing the amount of traffic in our cities. 

The increase in petrol and gas resources in earth is undeniable.Many scientists fear that in the coming years. there will be absolutely no resources left to use for cars or other transports.We are living in a world that is constantly using these kind of resources without doing anything the reproduce them.Imagine the world as a huge water wel.We are constantly taking little gulps from it not and thinking what will happen when the water is finished.As an addition the more we use these resources, the more expensive they get.This is why i think that humans will be forced to create new ways of transports.Like transports that use sunlight or hydrogene for example instead of petrol.This way cars will no longer be apart of our lives and we will start using different kinds of vehicles that have differnet names.

As a result i think the amount of cars in the coming years will increase because of the size of te problems stated above and humans will start using alternative vehicles that wont cause the same problems and that will make life easier."
4161,0,"I'm not quite agree with that the travel would be the best when it has tour guide.  But it is such a good idea to be with a group. And that guide lead you to know wonderful sites that the guide know them better than the tourists.  I would prefer have group guide if I have know idea about the country that I'm visiting.  I will discuss that difference in details supported by examples.
    Traveling is something nice and let you discover many things that you don't know before.  First, to discover the site that you visit you must have a guide because you have any idea about it at natural.  You might be see this site by the internet or a catalog.  In this case, the leader of the group will show all the sites that you came for them.  Second, the leader will give you a coplete idea about the city that you are visiting.  For example, you might visit such a country that has historical sites and some these sites's inhabitants home or their ancestor's home.  And the leader has plenty background about the history aspects of this country the tourist might want to know from him.
     In the other hand, I as a tourist I might use the tour guide for just some trips or some sites in particular.  For example, I can not use the tour guide when I want to visit a country that I have an idea about it.  Also I will not use the tour guide if I'm going to visit safe country or small country which I can go around the country veery easily.  Many cases that the tour guide must be with you.  For example, if you are traveling with senior people or very old people.  The tour guide would make it easier to move from site to site for the old people."
9057,0,"There are conflicting views whether young people enjoy life more than older people do. It depends on the location the person lives or the background situation the person underwent. Nevertheless, in my opinion, yound people enjoy life more as they have not encounted much, thus everything will be novel and exciting for them, plus, they have healthy bodies that permit them to enjoy life and young people tend to be less stressed, thus enjoy life more.

   Generally, the younger the person is, the less experiences s/he had gone through. Therefore, everything they do, it will be exicting for them as it would be a novel experience  for them. To exemplify this idea, a young person who travels by air will be enthusiastic, as for them, plane travel could be something extraordinary and novel, contrary to an older person who has already had abounding number of air travels. For that older person, it would be tiring and unenjoyable. 

  More importantly, it is no exaggeration to say that the state of one's health determines whether a person can enjoy life more than others. It is a known fact that the younger the person is, the healthier s/he is. 
To many, climbing the Himalaya mountains could mean enjoying life, seeing the natural beauty of the planent. Trekking for a month to climb the ever-lasting ranges of mountains until reaching the apex requires healthy body. Thus in other words, the younger the person is, more it is possible to enjoy life.

  Lastly, I am sure that many people will agree with me, as older we get, we tend to get more stressed out. When we are young, we only have to worry about school reports or doing well at school. Therefore we can freely enjoy life. Go clubbing and dancing all night without any worry. However, older people have many things to worry and care about. Parents have to worry about money. Enjoying life by going on a holiday, they worry if they can afford it or can they take a leave from work or more commonly, who will look after the children?

  To conclude, young people tend to enjoy life as they have the health capacity to do so, the mind and the passion. They don't get headaches like older people about money or children. Therefore, it is actually depressing to point out the fact that when people age and reach their retirement age, they cannot enjoy life as much as young people can."
9614,0,"Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. This can be because of their selfish behaviors or not having enough time to help but it is obvious that this is not a positive signal for the furutre of a community.

When I was a student in a college, there were some students coming from villages. They were going back to their families as soon as the holdays begin, to help their work on farms or etc. Even this situation sometimes had bad effects on their lessons, they had never thought not to help. Now, when I compare with the new generation, unfortunately the scene is not seems to me so helpful and willing. They all say that, they don't have enough time to help their parents even just for a few week during their summer holidays. 

The situation is similar for the public buses also.  When I was a child, it was a pitty to sitting down when a pregnant lady or and old men is standing. But today, young people are rarely give their seats to the others. 

I think one of the reasons of this situation is depends on the changes of the games of children. It was more training having team games than today's personal computer games. Team games are joyful as much as the personal games and also teaching children solving problems and  living together. Today's old people are the children of past's, and that's why, we know helping and sharing more than the new generation. 

Whatever the reason is, none of the excuses are acceptable for me. Becasue I believe that as the time changes, people are becoming to have more theirself-centered life style."
5799,0,"Whether people are better to have broad knowledge of various academic topics or to focus on a specific subject is a controversial issue.   On the one hand, gaining specific knowledge means that I might be able to discuss only this subject, but can argue deeply.   On the other hand, obtaining broad knowledge means that I can disscuss a variey of topics with different people.   However, in the final analysis, I agree with the former statement for the following reasons.

 For one thing, concentrating one subject can deepen my knowledge, thereby I am able to become a specialist of this subject. 
Compared to a generalist,  a specialist is much more demand in the job-hunting-world.   One example illustrates my points is that, when I undertook a job hunting, I had a bitter experience on it due to my major, social science. However, one of my friend, marketing major, had many offer from variety companies.  Based on my experience, focusing on a specific subject lead a successful businessperson today.
Additionally, obtaining one special knowledge can be unique strength which others are unlikely to have.  In our society, it is better that each person has each strengh.   If people have same statement about many topic, it is goint to be boring.

Therefore, considering all of the above factors, gaining specific knowledge is much more effective than learning broad subjects."
418,0,"Our world is filled with advertisements, they are on the walls, on the radio, on TV, on the internet, and even in artistic items such as movies or paintings. Can we consider the adds as being tricky? To what extent are they giving false information on a product and does it depend of the product or of the look that the consummer have on the product? As far as I am comcerned I believe that addvertisements don't lie as far as the consumer uses the product in good conditions.

	I am not working in the adventising world to have such a point of view, but for people who know a little about laws,  it is clear that advertisments cannot lie. There is a legal phrase "" lying advertisement"" that would punish all advertisers who would give to their products false properties. And that is the main point about a product that is in add as it is in real life.

	But how can we explain that products that are said to be wonderful don't plainly work when you buy it and use it at home? It is not because the product is ineficient but because it isn't used in the same conditions as those in the test lab. Let's take shampoo for instance,  they are said to make smoothy and shining hair in adds. But when you do buy it, it does not make the same. Why? Because at the first use you don't benefit of the active elements yet, and because your hair are weakened by pollution, stress, etc... that make them suffer. The shampoo yet can make your hair as smooth and shining it is said in the advertisement.

	The less point would be that our consumer's eye is not the same as the designer one. He will find his product perfect and he won't stop talking about the new things it brings to us. This is the main difference that separates the inventor from the user. We won't have the same regard on a car as the one of the ingeener who made it or the designer who drawnd it. The advertiser shares this regard with them."
1937,0,"In my opinion the broad knowledge change about what a person will going to do because i think is very important to have broad knowledge of many academics subjects, the reasons of this opinion are:
- if you have an a global knowledge you can have a lot possibility to choise a work and when you have a some difficult you are able to know better this problem and you have more possibility to resolving this problem because for any type of problem you are ready to resolve it.
May, if you have a broad knowledge of a one specific subject you are ready to test your ability  with any problem of this specific suject and i think you can know every aspect of this subjet without lot difficult.
But in my opinion is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because you can have more alternative than one specific subject and if you want to change what are you doing, you doesn' t have many problem and you are more free than if you are specialize in one specific subject.
I think this because i like change and i think that:
the change of situation is very interesting and been in always situation is so boring and when a person is boring is not happy and he doesn' t know the best situations during the life.
i think one person hoe is specialized in one specific subject doesn' t have a lot of means liberty because he have to think every day and every moment at the same think.

8211,0,"In my oppinion, I agree young people nowadays do not have enough time to helping their communities. There are two reasons of my oppinion. First, most of young people have a lot of homework and afterschooh programs. Besides, most of their parant do not care about their children if have pacience to help their communities. Therefore they maybe not educate them to help people when they were kids. Secondly, there are many attractive thing catch young peple's eyes. 
        In these days, most of young people have a lot of homework and afterschool programs must to do, especially in Taiwan. Young people want to enter the prestige schools and to achieve their parants' expection "" entering the famous school and have a good job."" They spent a lot of time studying and getting good grades. In the school, teacher will not actively encourage young people joint helping or servicing group to help and service other people. In addition, the young people will affaird of lose than other students as they spend time helping poor people. The homework and the pressure of entering the famous school make stusdents do not help people and the community actively. Moreover, most of their parants thinks helping people and the communities will make their children not concentrate on the point- entering the famous school and have a good job. Therefore, when they were kids the parants did not actively encourage them to connect with the communities and help someone. The parants' views directly affect young people's view. 
          Finally, the most important is that young children are attracted by the newest and funny things, for example, the song of hip pop , the famous singers ect.  Most of the young people think I do not use my time to help others, tracing the famous singers is most intersting. Above of all, there are few people care about encouraging their children to connect with their communities and help each other. It makes young people use their time to do another things which are meaningful to them. So i think young people do not share thier liesure time to the communities."

  First of all,we have to think ""how can we help to young people to turn good boys"".For instance,we can tell to them with television because they often watch the television later we can do advertisement.With this style they can turn the good boys.Now they see a problem but accoding to they  this is not problem.Of course not everytime but generally they were done.
  Next,we must give to they more one chance.Maybe they have big problem.For instance,i have so big problem because i will go to again prep in my school alraedy i went to one year later last summer i went to london to develop my self but in the last exam again i did not pass.I think my english is enough to pass from prep but i dont pass because of some rubbish exam in my school so i came to take toefl but already it is so so hard.Therefore,i am so angry because i will go to prep again.It is horrible.Did you see?i agree sometimes i behave similar young people.We need to help but i know it is imposible.I thing they can change with time and me too.I loved english bur now my brain is complex because i could not stay class it was first time.Hopefully i can change but it so hard.they are definetly similar me.We must give to them chance to dev"
6504,0,"Of course, students have to learn facts from teachers and memolize them. However, it is only a first step to proceed their study. They should spend most of time to figure out ideas and concepts. By doing this, they can acquire appication skills. Moreover, they can enjoy their studies.
     To begin with, they can get highly developed appication skills if they try to understand matters. You will agree with this idea: person who knows the nature of matter can perform well when he works on new problems, rather than person who only memolized surface of the matter. They can applicate their ideas if they know the matter deeply. Now, it is often said that Japanese lack the appication skill. We are ranked in a lower position when the research is out. In contrast, countries, like US, are ranked higly every time. We know the cause of this situation. The education of Japan higly emphasizes memolizing. We must take hard entrance examination when we enroll in high school and university. So, although we often memolize the facts, we seldom have opportunity to think the matter deeply. So, students can raise their appication skill by understanding the concept itself.
     Second, understanding the nature of problems is much more attractive for students. They can get pleasure when they find out the solution or they could understand the concept. Therefore, they can continue studying with joyful. We want to do what we like rather than dislike. It also helps raising their accademic skills. In contrast, in case of learing all things, they will stop studying. For me personally, I didn't like studying at all until I entered university. I could not find joy in studying because I had to memolize many facts. However, almost all studies in universities assign us to think by ourselves. Now, studying is not disconfort.
     Because of the application skills and joyment, I believe students should concentrate on understanding. They can raise their ability and become interested in studying more."
6900,0,"In my opinion, young people actually enjoy life more than older people do. I hold this opinion because young people are less weak, less afraid, and less fragile than older people tend to be.

	First of all, the majority of young people have alot of energy they can disperse without becoming tired easily. While most aged people get tired after just one activity, young people, like students, can do many activities in just one day. Even after long hours of work in school, they can easily take part in an afterschool activity, and then come home to do homework and chores. On the other hand, older people get tired quickly even after one activity, such as cleaning the house. Being able to do many activities in one day promotes the sense of accomplishment and happiness, and thus young people who have more energy enjoy life more than older people.

	In addition, young people tend to be more brave than older people, and take more risks. Risks, because no outcome can be predicted, add excitement to the lives of young people. However, most older people prefer being stable and assured, and do not take risks. For example, alot of young people will travel to distant countries, and gain more experience. However older people prefer remaining where they are. Thus in the lives of older people things are monotonuous and predictable, whereas in the lives of young people, nothing can be predicted and everything is exciting.

	Furthermore, young people are also more mentally capable than older people. As people grow old, they lose their ability to concentrate for long periods of time, or to learn new things. In contrast, young people are full of potential and can learn new things, like another language or a new recipe. Learning new things is very enjoyable, and younger people who have the advantage of better mental capabilities, enjoy life more than older people.

	Older people are restrained by various factors, such as fragility and inability to continue activities for long period of time. However, because young people are stronger physically, mentally, and also have less fear, their lives are filled with excitement and fun, enabling them to enjoy life more than older people do."
10400,0,"I  am not agree with this statement.I am not agree with this statement because,from my point of view,it won't be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today.
   I my opinon it will be more cars firstly because they will give a major utility and we could do many more things with our car than we can do today.In twenty years time,cars will have everything included and you will be able to do whatever you want while you are driving.This is one of the main reasons that I use to argue that it won't be less cars in the future than nowadays.
   Another reason is that from my point of view,the number of cars will increased because they will be more sefety and this fact will aloud  underaged people to drive a car because they will have many systems to prevent the accidents.
   Since many time,cars have been the most safety transport in the world,and I think this is not going to changed,because cars companies moves a lot of money and they will do everything to sell more cars and make them more safety and comfortable.
  Another fact that in my opinion will make the number of cars increase in the future is that the goverments are spending a lot of money in the rebuilt of many highways that will make the trevel by car more safety,comfortable a safer.
  To sum up,I would like to say that for me,cars are a very important part in our daily life and it will be an more important in twenty years than there are today."
1756,0,"I disagree with the given statement. In my opinion, young people do their best to help their community and society.I can say this with conviction because I myself have done my best to help society.
 
My grandmother runs a primary school for children with limited means. Since I was about ten years old, I have been going to this school every summer to do voluteer work. I have interacted with the children, played games like soccer and cricket with them, taught them extra-curricular activities like dance and painting and even taught the children younger to me academic subjects like math sometimes. It is a great feeling to be able to give to somone something so important - education. Some of the children there became my friends and I still do talk to them. Some of them are in high school now.

My brother too has been doing his bit for the society. He goes to old age homes. He interacts with the old people there and reads stories to them. They are lonely and need someone to talk to. They feel extremely touched when young children like my brother take out time to come and meet them. My brother too loves to go and spend time with them. 

Many of my friends are into community service as well. A very good friend of mine, Julia, works closely with mentally challenged patients. She is also an active volunteer for a school with mentally challenged students. 

So, in my opinion, it will not be entirely correct to say that young people do not take out enough time to help their communities. I do agree that there are exceptions this, that there are people who do not wish to indulge in community service. However, they are mere exceptions."
1094,0,"I have to difine what is success or who is successful. In this essay, Iwould like to define the success as people  who could get a lot of money in business or who could get the fame and status. There are many people who could suceed in some particular field. I feel that most of them did new things and carried out the new planning. Therefore, I agree with the statement.
	The first reason I agree to successful people always try to new things and take risks is because just following what people already know how to do well never leads to success. Doing exact the same thing with other people doing don't people grow up. In other words, the people who don't grow up cannot suceed in any fields. 
	The second reason why I think successful people try new things and take risks is because most of people who don't suceed think that they don't want to take risks. They choose the safer way. I believe that succeeding in some field always associates with some risks like financial, time, human relationship, and so forth. If success does't associate with risks, everyone could suceed. success is not so easy task in the society. 
	In conclusion, I strongly believe that successful people try to new things althogh there are some risks in what they try to do. Fearing some risks dones't lead to suceess."

On the other hand, others think that thay don't have a lot of time to practice a new things. However, there are stronger reasons to support the fact that it is important beatiful themes to learn about you don't know.
     New things learn us a lot lessons and experiences to face many problems in future.  Education system's many lessons  are organized  to learn us how to deal with many facts around us. Such as self-control, self-motivation, enthusiasm, and many skills like that are detected and learned by doing new things, thus exposing us to varieties of situations build for us these skills.
    Most successful people around world having in common some characters and interests, but the most feature liked among them is that they always put themselfes in difficuly situations in order to attain their goals. For example, I took the toefl exam and I got a bad  Score in it. If I re-gain  taking it and study on the same materials withe same mannar, I will get the same score.
     The problem is that many opponents of practicing new things are themselves unware of advantages of looking for a new expertise.  Moreover, they onely focus on the theory that I used the same thing in order to at save sides,What they fail to say, is that I they did the same thing several times, you will got the same result.

4135,0,"We all hope that we want to enjoy our lives. Then this question comes to my mind, which enjoy life more, young people or older people? I think young people enjoy life more than older people. There are three reasons. First, young people have healthier bodies than older people do. Second, they have longer time in rest of their lives than the older people do. Third, older people tend to say that the younger the better.
     First of all, young people have healthier and stronger body than older people do. They can continue to work longer, run faster, need shorter time to sleep, and so on than the old people do. That means young peopel can enjoy what the old people can not do. For example, they can swim in the mornig, go out for lunch, go shopping, and have party with their friends.
    Second, they have longer time remained in their lives than the old people do. If you want to be a very good and famous doctor, it will take about ten years to attend medical school and get enough experience as a doctor. Young people can plan and achieve this aime because they have time. However, old people may not beacuse they only have limited time in rest of their lives.
    Finally, I often hear old people say that the younger the better. I am still young and can only imagine how the lives of old people. The old people, however, experienced life of young people already and say the younger the better comparing their lives to the ones when they were young.
    To conclude. I believe young people enjoy life more than old people. They have strong body to do anything they want while old people have limitations because of their health problems. Also, young people have longer time to do anything. In addition, old people admit that the younger the better. I strongly believe that young people enjoy life more than old people. Actually, I think, that means young people have to challenge anything they want and have to enjoy their lives to the max."
3269,0,"There exists an opinion that young people nowadays do not tend to spend enough time to helping their communities. Indeed, I agree with this statement.
     First of all, the notion of individualization has taken over in modern times and consequently among the young generation. Young people place more value on individual interests than they do on the interests of the community they are in. As a result they tend to devote an appreciable amount of time to their own works and private lives. This in turn, as may easily be guessed, does not leave much time for them to do something for their communities.
     Moreover, the lives of young people became much more difficult than they were in the past. By the word 'difficult' I mean that the conditions that face the young generation are more cruel and competitive. The world population and hence the amount of young people increases year by year. Therefore, in order to achieve something in life, the representatives of the young generation have to work much harder and concentrate more on their own interests. In other words, they just do not have time to be engaged in helping their communities. I would like to bring my life as an example. I want to become a successful scientist in the future. However, nowadays there is an appreciable amount of students who would like to pursue a scientific career - especially in my field (genetics). Therefore, in order to 'outweigh my rivals' I have to work quite hard and have very little time to help my parents, relatives or friends.
     Furthermore, helping someone else in general and the community in particular should involve a great sense of responsibility. However, as far as I could observe the members of the current young generation usually lack that. In other words, they do not want to take responsibility for someone else and hence do not tend to help that 'someone else'.
     In conclusion, I would like to mention that in view of the reasons and the example stated above, I certainly think that at our times young people  do not spend a reasonable amount of time devoted to helping their communities."
2960,0,"Some people agree to the idea that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning concepts. Others think learning facts should come first. In terms of critical thinking, I have to say understanding ideas and concepts is more helpful and worthy than learning facts.   
Based on the field of study, facts are playing a important role. For instance, if you are a biology student you should know all the terminologies related to the human body in order to explore further topics. In Art, knowing the differences of Realism and Classicism is the foundation of your knowledge. Then, you can classify genres and styles of movies. 
However, students will not be able to develop critical thinking unless they understand ideas and concepts if they know about only facts. For example, with a scientific fact is presented in class and no discussion or analyzation is followed to help students understand the concepts,Once students understand the ideas why a certain history event had happened in the past, it would be easy for them to understand the consequenses of that event. 
In conclusion, both understanding ideas and concepts ant learning facts are critical in learning."
11461,0,"It is ofcourse more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. I completely agree with the above given statement.
     
    Learning is an imporant part of a person's life. Right from the time when a child is born,he learns to eat, to drink, to walk, to play and so on. After some time,he learns to study and takes the student's life.At school,teachers teach him various subjects as a result of which he needs to learn facts. He mugs up these facts in order to excel as a student.

      I , however, think that just learning and mugging up facts is not the requirement attaining success. This does not serve the purpose of education. On the other hand, an understanding of the ideas and concepts is what holds importance. One should get a clear knoledge of the ideas which have been explained in a subject matter. 
        
          When a student gathers knoledge and information in this way, he becomes able to successfully apply these concepts in his life. This not only helps him as a student but also becomes useful in his future. A successful student then becomes successful in his professional life as well. This is because he learns to use his knoledge into practicality. 

            The above stated reasons clearly stress and explain my point of view. According to me, getting students to learn facts and ideas other than mugging up facts can be encouraged only with the help of the educational institution.I hence conclude my essay by saying it is only possible when thereis a change in the attitude of the teachers who are a part of the educational institutions such as schools, colleges and universities. Teachers will have to explain the imporance of understanding ideas instead of learning things nd encourage them to studyin this manner."

                                                        Young ones are  the ones who can do something for the society . In earlier days at the time when people should do something for the country along with there studies and the thing that most of the parents should encourage on all and they should make there children more concerned to the communities.
                      A small example for this is that  one off my relatives son every day he should have to clean around his house and  see the gardening . And thus he can help the community by keeping it clean. in this way each and evey person should involve in doing so. so that we can develop the country. Every one of us should take part oand conduct survey and seminars so that they can learn how useful they are and then they will get involved.

7819,0,"As we can read on a lot of magazines, mainly on the ones dedicated to environmental problems, the number of cars in use in the world has increased a lot during the second half last century. 

This is mainly due to the economic development, which characterised a lot of part of the world, and to the  high value of the population.
 In the meantime we have to consider that  the environment is suffering from thyis situation and that the stock of energy is continously diminishing.
I agree with the statement that in the future there will be fewer cars in use than are today only in part. The importance of the environment ( for exaample, in some cities is not possible to use a car one day per week...thi in order to reduce air pollution)  and the situation of the necessary resources to produce fuels for the cars bring to me to think that in the future there will be a reduction of the number of cars but I'm not able to say  when this reduction will happen. As example of thethe restiction
I work for an Oil Company and I heard a lot of time discussions about this topic. The fuel demand has incresed a lot and the production too but the possibilities to find new giaciments in order to extract petroleum are not so hight. The first reason is that several places cannot be the scenario of petroleum operation due to law restriction...obviously in order to protect the envinroment...than the high level of tecnology requested ha to be considered.
An other aspect that could influence the use of carshas to be anayized: the public services. Our cities are giving us more services day by day and people is becoming to use all the these services such as bus and undergrond. This fact too can be considered an action against the use of cars in favor of the environment. It would be interesting to know the reaction of the Oil Company and the car producers...I hope that they will find an other type of engine...frendlier to the environmet,"
8013,0,"I agree whit the statement that successful peolple try to do new things and not only what they are already good to do.
In my opinion this is a main aspect of a successful person, indeed successful people have the ability to understand what they can try to do even if they know that they already haven't the preparation to do that.
Someone can't became a real successful person if he does't try to risk.
He has to have the ability to understand that he can try to do something even if he does't know how to do that.
In modern society it is more difficult to rase over other people than some years ago, so people, who want success, have to go over their own limits to try if they are really able to do some thing.
It is like when someone bet, he doesn't know if he will win, but he knows that if he will win he will be happy and successful.
Nowadays there isn't so much space for weak people in the high levels of the society.
But there is  a big problem about this aspect of successful people, and it is a proplem for all the society.
I think doing this, there is a low quality of activity.
In other words, if someone stop to do something when he becomes able to do that, because he wants to do something else, there won't be a person able to do that work and so there will be less quality."
1958,0,"I believe that while people who keep doing what they know they can do well can be successful for a certain period of time, they will eventually have to turn to something different and try new things in order to stay successful in the long run. Thus, people who are successful over long periods of time are usually characterized by the willingness to give up the familiar and to ""explore the unknown"", that is to try out different things even if they do not know how it will turn out.
   In the short run, people can be successful by clinging to what they know how to do well if they are doing something which others cannot copy easily. Consider, for instance, a painter who masters a certain technique of painting which is popular among buyers of art and which other painters cannot copy. This painter may be successful even if there is not much alternation, say,  in the themes of her paintings, because she is the only one who can produce such works of art and people are willing to buy them.
   But success based on keeping doing what one can do well may not be of long duration. Let us continue the example of the painter introduced above: Other painters may try to copy the artist's painting techniques and themes, an eventially they may manage to do so. If so, the works of art of the painter who had used this special technique first do not any longer stand out as much as they used to because others have gained the ability to reproduce similar works of art. In order to stay successful, our painter may now have to try out something different: For instance, develop a new technique or turn to different themes. She will have to explore new ways of painting. If she manages to do so in a way which friends of art find appealing, she will again be one or several steps ahead of her ""competitors"", and she will continue being successful and reknowned as a painter.
   A similar logic can be applied to the case of industrial production. A person who invents a new kind of product and who is the first to introduce it to the market will be successful in selling this product at a high price and will make profits if customers like this product. However, over time competitors will manage to copy the product or supply similar substitutes. Thus, the producer will have to decrease the sales price of his product if he still wants to sell it, and his profits will be reduced. In order to keep profits on their previous high level, the producer will have to conduct research in order to invent and introduce new products; that is, he will have to give up the familiar and try out something different.
   Therefore, I believe that people who are successful over long periods of time are people who are willing to try new things instead of simply keeping doing what they know they can do well."
3414,0,"I agree that students should understand ideas and concepts than learning the facts alone.
With out understanding of an idea or concept, the application of a fact doesnt happen.If you just learn the fact, you may memorise it but do not know where to exactly apply it.Practical application requires understanding of a concept.For example If a child simply learns the fact that ""Telling lies is bad"" with out understanding the importance associated with the statement, it may end up in dilemma in many situations.On the other hand if the child is explained and given proper idea or concept of what happens when you tell lies, using real life simple examples, it may confidently avoid telling lies and adhere to habit of speaking truth.Also you can take an instance of a student who memorised the whole theory but unable to demonstrate a practical technique because of lack of understanding of the concept.So understanding the concept or idea is required to know its importance and to enable them to apply it in practical situations.

Furthermore, learning a fact is better if you understand it in a right way.In other words, if you understand the concept or idea involved, learning a fact is simple.It can be illustrated with an example of child learning Fractions in Mathematics.If child simply memorises that 1/2 is greater than 1/4, it may get confused while taking test.But if you make the child understand the concept using a cookie by dividing one cookie into 4 parts and explaining that each part represents a fraction.So the three parts are more than two which inturn is more than one part.So child can understand that 1/3 is greater than 1/2 which is in turn more than 1/4 and be confident solving fractions on exam.

Also understanding a fact or concept promotes deeper understanding.For eg a child who memorised the fact may not be able to answer if a question about a topic which he/she  memorised  is asked in a different way.But one who knows it's application or understood the concept answers without hesitation.Learning only promotes short term memory, which is susceptible for getting lost.But the ideas and concepts we understand enter the longterm memory and henceforth sustain forever.Moreover while doing things,  the concept of which is understood, we can act spontaneously.
In short developing concept or understanding ideas about things will make learning more easy,permanent and logical.Henceforth students should develop understanding of a fact before learning them."

65,0,"A hundred years ago nobody thought that these days we would have millions and millions of cars in use in every country. 

I don't think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use. In fact, I do belive that the number of cars in use will increase dramatically. One fact that may cause this is that there will be more single people than nowadays, and they will all need a way of transportation from home to their place of work.

Another reason why numer of cars will increase is that rich people love cars. They think they are better persons if they have more cars than anyone. That's why they will keep on buying them and using all of them to try to show how rich, powerful and great persons they are.

In addition, cars are may be the best way to get from one place to another: it is the cheapest way to travel, and you are free to decide where you want to go, even to change your opinion during the travel.

But cars do represent a big problem to our environment. They produce toxic gases that affects the ozone layer. Due to these gases our lungs are polluted too. Now there are more people with cancer than back then.

In the future, cars will face another problem: the matter that there will not be enough oil to all of them.

Is there anything that we can do to protect ourselves and our environment from pollution and also still have the chance to travel whenever we want, wherever we want, anytime we want? Yes, there ir. But the solution, unfortunately, has not been developed yet. We need new ways of transport, such as vehicles that runs thanks to electricity instead of oil. That's why I really believe that when these 'green vehicles' get to be developed, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. However, it won't happen in twenty years."
1722,0,"In twenty years from now,the number of cars in use will be extremely high.There is no chance for having less number of cars.There are quite many reasons to support my statement.
       The main reason for expecting a huge number of cars in mere future is by considering the past records.The number of cars some years ago were very less.But today its number is almost doubled.Every process future analysis is based on a ""HYSTERISIS"" curve, which shows the probability of any issue considering the past statistics.In the same manner we can have a histerisis curve for the usage of cars.It depicts a huge increase of number of cars in use in future.
     The other main reason is the increase in the population and their standards of living.The standards of living of people is increasing day by day.People are aiming high and acheiving high.Every one is trying to reach the best position in life.A car reflects the status of a person in the society.So people are showing interest to own a car.Its becoming one of their most important part of their luxury list.So it can be expected that every middle class individual owns a car in coming twenty years.This increases the number of cars used.
       The selling price of a car is becoming immensely low these days.Its being reachable to every middle class individual.As the price is diminishing with time, every one is planning to own a car.Even car industries are planning to reduce the price of the cars to increase their sales.This is to make them reachable to each and every person.
          For example,consider a television.Television was a dream to every common man few years ago.Its cost was around 3000$ before.Its demand was less at that time due to its heavy price.But today its cost came to less than half .Today everyone owns a television.Same is the case with mobile telephones too.In the same way we can say that a car becomes a part of life to almost every middle class individual.
       So,by considering many reasons and facts we can say that the number of cars that will be used in coming twenty years will be absolutely high.Almost every individual owns a car in future."

One can always feel boring to travell as accompained. the tour in groups all together can fell like one family as brothers,sisters,uncles grandfathers  and grandmothers. So there we feel very happy by spending with all the group people and there is no worries as there is a guide who helps and shows all the locations all the way.
In groups there is no need of a security problem no feeling of lonelyness.In groups we may have many concessions in the fairs and some packages which were offered at low rates this was an advantage for travelling in groups.
  	The best example when i'm in high school we had a tour to NewDelhi in meanwhile we enjoyed all the way in the train by singing songs,dancing and commenting one another. After reaching there we in group visited all the tourist spots and spent very jolly.
            It was the time when I visited the same locations alone and i felt very bad , even not intrested to see all the places.
 	Another reason is the people with whom do we like to have the tour may is always busy or unable to have time to come with us. So we never feel missing them when we move in groups. We dont know the time spent with them it is like a magic me may forget all the things and move to the new  world of dreams.
Everyone likes to visit all the places, bu mostly they think about the travelling time and the expences.If we travell in single the expences will be more we should spent moreon the comodities for our needs. In the groups travellin expences for person to person may vary as the number of persons is incresaing cost for head to head may vary. So within the low budget ,with security ,with company we may have our tour sucessfully with lot of joy and happiness."

	But, I totaly agree with the statement that is more important to students to understand the concepts, than is for the to learn the facts. 
	I think this way, mainly because by understanting the concepts and ideas, you are really getting the basis of knowlege (you can go to the deeps of it). It's the only way to go to the bottom on the issues. If you just learn a memorize the facts (and leave the undestanding of concepts behind), you won't be able to innovate. 

	I think facts are the starting point. By revising and questioning those facts and working based on them, knowing their cause and effect is the key. The only way to do this, is by the understanting of the ideas and concepts that lead to those facts. In other words, If you just learn the facts and don't know where the came from, you won't be a complete all-arround student, just memorizing machine.

	The great human minds over the course of history, have been well knowned for understanding the ideas they worked on. Albert Einstein once said: ""you realy don't know something, until you're able to explaining it to your grandmother..."", meaning that the only way teach something in a way anyone can follow, is putting it in simple form. The way to achive this, is by dominating the concepts and ideas well (knowing where they come from, so you can put it in different words). Try to picture Einstin explaning to his grandmother one of his teories, just giving her the facts....

The advertisement is the process that show a product and try to convince people to buy it. Mass media are full of advertisement, sometimes we can say that mass-media are maintained by advertisement (a factory can spend a lot of money to buy spaces on tv, newspaper etc.). Expecially from the 80's/90's spot's campaign became very very important  to promote products... there are factories that spend a lot of money to study how a spot can influence the mind of the people, and how the spot can be an advantage for the selling of the specific product. The phrase that i've red is about that most advertisement make products seem much better than tey really are. I completely agree with this statement. As i said before, in these last years the promotion of the products became obsessive. A lot of products, in tv for examples, are shown like the ""PERFECT PRODUCT"": they are  clean, positive, beautiful and expecially VERY VERY attractive. When i was a little child i remember that i've seen a spot about a game, i don't remember the name, but this is not important. The game was a plastic man with a lot of blades, cars, guns, enemies... When i saw this spot i praid my mother for a lot of time to buy me this game, and when she bought it i was really impressed. The man was smaller, poorer... there was only 1 blade and not all the guns that were shown in the spot. The problem of the spots is not about childs' games, but is about the lies that are inside of it. You can lie about a game it doesn't matter, but you cannot lie for example about a food, about something that can cause dangers to a person (like mcdonald's for example, if you have seen the film ""Supersize Me"" you'll understand this)... Now i don't pay attention to the spots, 'cause i know that they lie a lot... but all people do this? Or i take part to a minimum percentage of people that doesn't seem to pay attention to the advertisement?

Travel is in a group led by a tour guide can help us to solve the many kinds of anxieties that other kind of travel cannot. I will show the merits of travel in a group with a tour guide.

   First, travel in a group with a guide can reduce time waste. If we travel without guide, we may wandering so many times because we don't have a lot of knowledge that where is important place and what we have to see. So guide can help us to travel around important place. 

   Second, travel in a group with a guide can reduce money waste. If we travel without guide, we must pay a lot of money because we don't know how much those is. while travel with a guide, we don't worry about that. Almost all of the tour guides already contracted with restaurants, shopping malls and many places. So, we can uses all kind of things in travel unexpensively by giving cheaper money to guide. 

   Third, we don't worry about danger by traveling in a group with a tour guide. If we travel to strange place alone or travel with some people, we cannot relax. We may put in trouble with other people because of cultural differences and we may be terrible hurted by strange animals. So travel in a group with a guide can reduce our anxiety.

12050,0,"I dont agree with this statement that sais that succesful people are the ones who try new things and take risks rather than those that only do what they already know how to do well.  I think that both things in different ways can bring success to a persons life.
Sometimes a person is good at doing something, and it really enjoy doing it, so she/he really put effort and commit to do  the best they can, and they get success on doing that.
Furthermore, a person that dosen't feel good of doing something or feels that they can be better on doing something else should take a risk of trying new things. For example, my Mom was  good at her job in a bank, but she feel like she need a change and so she took the risk of trying opening  her own bussiness. Her dream was to open a spa, that in my country there are few. So she did it, she took the risk and open her spa. Now is the best spa in my country, even people from other countries comes to mine just to try the spa.
What I want to ilustrate with this example is that sometimes if you take risks or try new things you could be a succesful person, but this is not always the case. Sometimes just doing what you now how to do well, and doing it with effort and willing to do be the best, you can also be a successful person.
Someone once told me  ""Do what you want, but do it right"". So this is what I am trying to explain, taking risks or doing what you know how to do well, but do it the best you can and you will succed.


Successful is around the corner so try your best and you will find it!!!"
8727,0,"I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are. Most advertisements use emotional figures, present the product in a way that is very appealing to the consumer or attacks the competitors by claiming that their product offers more quality per unit price. These are the tools that advertising companies choose for products generally in order to convince the target consumers to buy; however they can be misleading and consumers can be disappointed after their initial experince.
First of all, using the emotional figures in the advertisements  is a method used very much recently. We can see speaking cows playinf football in a milk advertisement or several cartoon figures that are the favourite ones for children. This method especially influences the kids very much and they insist on buying that product. However, the advertisment does not promise a quality for a repeated buying,
Additionally, intoducing a product in a very appealing way can be an  exaggreation. For instance, advertisement may say a chocolate is very tasteful that you can never want to share it with a friend, but it may be that it does not taste good.
Lastly, some advertisments attact competitors rather than just claming on their products and present a comparative advantages like lower price per quality, highest effectiveness, having the most beneficial  fuctions. Nevethelesss, this method also can be very misleading. For example, a car can be cheaper than the other cars with the same quality and functions, nonetheless it can have lower sustainability or less terms on guarantee. Being cheaper does not mean you will be satisfied with its quality.
In conclusion, the methods used in the advertisements can bve very misleading can cause use make wrong decisions about the things you need and you want to purchase. Sometimes, less appealing and aggressive and dull advertisments of some products can offer a much more quality or compensation for the needs and preferences."
3984,0,"When was signed the Human Right Declaration? Who signed it? Where? Are you sure to remember all the anwers by heart? 
If not, do not need to conclude that you are a bad person who does not know anything. However, this conclusion can be easily reached if you do not know the objectives of the Declaration and its importance. Maybe this example is not the best but it helps me to explain that even if facts are important, understanding ideas and concepts is a priority. 

When students are going to school, they want to learn to better comprehend their environment. To reach these objectives, they have to think, ask questions and learn ideas and concepts. Ideas have the advantage to be transversal and be re-use on different subjects. Indeed, the example of the Human Rights is not only an historical element but also a philosophical and anthropological question. By knowing the concepts, students can make cross-over and see how some themes are connected.

Facts are still useful but they are mainly illustrations, examples. They give value added to students to apprehend their lessons to give a practical dimension to a theorical problem. They should be highly regarded and well-used,  however, they should not be seen as the ultimate goal. Knowing fact without being able to relate them to some ideas is a waste of time. A person is not more intelligent by the amount of information he knows but by the quality and his ability to use it. Therefore, students should learn to think no only to repeat.

Finally, once students have ideas and concepts in their mind, learning facts is not the most difficult thing to accomplish. Our world with the help of images, television, media is full of facts. You open any newspaper you will find fact on a multitude of subject. The real difficulty is to analyze them. That is why I will definetely encourage students to take some distance from facts, think,  and try to make some relationship with ideas and concepts. By that way, they will add value added to their work and remember easily the different historical date, names and facts!"

Firstly, they dont have any sort of tension in their life as the older ones have.It's a very wise saying that,""Life is too short buddy,dont spend the time of your life in worries"". Older ones have responsibility towards their family,their job,their society which makes their life somewhat miserable and full of worries as compared to the young ones.Many philosophers also have supported the view that children are the most innocent species on the earth.So,obviously being innocent and without worry may be sounds impractical to an older man but in reality this is the main reason behind being happy

The family and friends of a child act as an agent of socialisation teaching them the difference between the good and the bad.These agents of socialisation always put them in such a domain where the child will always prosper.They bring every thing for the child that is necessary for his goodwill and for leading toward a bright future.Friends are also play a big role in developing a childrens life which makes their life enjoyable

Thirdly,they can do the things in their future what the older people do, for instance , going to a club or mountain trekking or having a girlfriend.But the older people cant have the type of fun the young ones have as they cant switch back to their past.We heard many times older people saying,""Wish i would be young again"" and many songs too by famous artists.

Thus,family,friends and all of the agents of socialisation having around the children to keep take care of them,children dont have the thing called worries.And if they have,then Santacluase always present around them to make them happy"
761,0,"The issue at hand is if young people nowadays participate enough in helping their communities. This issue is important because it is directly related to our daily habits. In my view young people do not take the time to helping their communities because they have other responsabilties to take care of first.

First, young people first think to their obligations. School has taken an important part in our students life which can not be neglictated. The work required from school is so abondant that it makes more difficult for students to bring their help for their communities. I think that can be consider as an eventual explanation of why young people do not give enough time for supporting their communities.

Secondly, we are living in a society where appears more and more distractions. Young people prefer getting some relax after school rather than getting involve to another thing. Helping communities required involvement and concentration which can be considered as similar as school so it is not really restfull. This point shows another aternaltive to explain this fact. 

Additionnally, as it has been mentioned previously communities required involvement from us which means that we also have to be interesting in what they are goin to undertake. The subject or the actions might just interest young people. For example,if our community wants to prevent from steals or breakinf houses they will need volunteers. If nobody has encounter that kind of problems, they might not be interessting in getting involve to this. Therefore not a lot of people will be in. This can be anothe aspect of the lack of yound people in helping their communities.

To sum it up, their involvment at school, the fact that there are more and more distractions and finally that the actions made by the community may not interest young people can affect their involvement. Howeve, they should have a look at it when living in community."
8129,0,"Being specialised in one academic subject or in many subjects which is better?and is it true that the more subject u specialise in the more acadamic and better you will be?
People's opinion in the number specialization differs widely,but the question is which is better?
First of all,to be specialized in one subject makes the person more professional in the subject  he choose.Secondly,in work he would have a higer rank which means that more salary will be offered to him which can lead him to have a better life like having luxury cars and house,but the problem that it may be hard for him to ind a good work if he was specialized in a rare subject.
Also their are quite alot of advantages for having more than one specialized subject like1-more oppurtunity for him to find a work2-give him the chance to work in more than one place which may lead to more salary but in the same time more stress3-makes him have a better place in the community due to his knowledge in many things which may make him help many people.
But in my opinion,having more than one specialze subject is better because it is possible for the person with many specialism to have the same degree in all of his subjects as the person who has just one specialze subject with the degree.Also i think that having one specialize subject may take a big effort to find a good job with a good salary.For example my cousin studied in US computer science and came to UAE to study there but couldnt find a job because it is not needed in this country so he had to studfy again another subject in order to live his life.As they said the more knowledge you have the more important you will be in your county."
5662,0,"It is a widespread topic of discussion whether young or old people are more capeable of enjoying life. To compare both oppinions, one first has to review possible advantages and disadvantages the both sides gain from their youth and their already spend lifetime, respectively. The benefits of youth are quite obvious: A young person normaly has more energy and is in a better physical condition than an older member of the society. Additionally, they do not have the responses coming with a job, a family and so on.
Older people on the other hand might have a major advantage: experiance. Though they might not any longer be in a state to do what ever they want, probably due to the reasons mentioned above, they still might be able to enjoy what they are doing much more than young people do. If you grow older, you might become a little more settled than you are in your young, ""wild"" years, that is certainly true. But if you are able to get rid of the fear to miss something important, if you do not try to run through your life on top speed to catch every adventure you can, you might be able to make much more intense experiances. Those might be fewer, but still more enjoyable than the superficial ones of the youth.
So the question to be answered is: what is more enjoyable? Many superficial or few intense experiances? In my oppinion the truth lies somewhere in between. It is certainly good to live a fast life in the youth, and it is probably necessary to do so to be able to calm down when you grow older, as long as you do not overstress it. This way you can experiance both sides.
In the end, everybody has to answer this specific question for him- or herself, there is now overall solution. Some people might enjoy a life full of parties, travelling and action. Others will prefer a nice home and a family, which provides hold and support a even during your old days. Both will tell you, their way is the one to enjoy life most."

7578,0,"Nowadays advertisements have a big impact on our lives. They can be very infuencial on our decisions  and  choices related to the our shops.
We can find them everywhere, on television while we are watching a movie or a show, on newspaper, on internet and also on the streets. Sometimes when we open our mail box we find a lot of advertisements about for example restaurant and shops .
Not always what they tell describe the real qualities of a product.
In fact I think that often they make products seem much better then they are.Sometimes for example we buy a product because we have heard so much about it and its incredible properties but latter when we use it we realize that we have been stupid.
In fact the product quality does not corrisponds with the description in the spot and furthermore we have problably spent more buying it instead of a similar product which was not advertised.
In particular I believe that these advertisement are more powerful with children. In fact they usually ask their parents to buy a game or a pair of shoes because they have seen them on television, they have been attracted by the presentation of this product and they really believe that they can reproduce what is showed on these advertisements.
In conclusion I think that it is better to be a little doubtful when we see these spots. When we buy a product we have to be carefull because sometimes a common product which we have not ever see before can shows the same properties and qualities of the one which is advertised. We will problably save money."
6643,0,"I agree with the following statement.

There are two reasons why I think so.

First of all, if you just learn the facts you can't solve another quetions related what you learned because you just know one depending fact.
On the other hand, if you know the idea and concept of somethintg, you could solve some another quetions related what you leaned  because you can use the idea and concept for solving. This is a very important thing. For example when you have to soluve a ploblem at the company you work, it doen't work that you just learn facts ,but
does work if you learn some idea and concept because you can use those for solving.
Therefore to understand ideas and concepts are important.

Secondly. by understanding ideas and concept, you probably think why it was to be. To know why it was to be is not easy because you have think very much and . But that is really benefital.
Because nowaday most company reqire people who are not just smat but have great imagination. By thinking somethig is very helpful for imgination. So to understand ideas and concepts  are very important.

As i said, to understand Ideas and concepts are very important.
studying is impotant not only for students but for people who are working. so you have to careful when"
4212,0,"I agree to the statement that it is more important for student to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. But it's also important to know facts. Bacause every idea and concept still requires basic facts which are necessary to really understand them. You have to decline two kind of facts: facts which are basic knwoledge and facts which are only important if you want to handle it deeply.  
Many of today's students learn facts, but they don't really understand it. And so it is better for students and for life preparation to understand ideas and concepts than only to know facts.
For example: if you know how something work you must not know why it works. Many students learn strictly all details of an idea but they don't realize the whole.
In many subjects you have to learn by hard to get all details, but it is better to understand the concept which allows students to study, recognizing and solving problems which are still different but mainly the same basic.
But students should know and learn facts, too. Because in todaz's life every problem must be analized and its solution must founded on especially facts. To solve a problem without detailed facts is very unprofessional kind of working. Other persons with ground knwoledge should be able to find failures in your documentation.
Learning must consist out of both: founded knowledge compared with ideas and concepts. 
Ideas and concepts may include facts which are neccesary to understand them. 
Many students know and learn only as much as needed to pass an exam or anzthing else. This might be good for the moment but you can't pass life very well. A reason for this could be also a problem of teaching skills.
All in all it must be important for every student to reach a founded education with both: detail knowledge and basic ideas."
4418,0,"Many people asserted that youg people nowadays don't give enough time to helping their communities .Although it would easy to accept this statement at fact value ,it is such a complex one .Personally, I disagree this statement for two reasons.

The first reason for my disagreement is that personailty.A man 's worth is not lie in what he has but lie what he is.That is to say ,personailty is essentially.Take me for example.When I was college student ,Even we had a lot of things to do, we still seprated the rest of  time to helping our communities.We do a lot of things such as assisted  taking care homeless child , play with them ,and read story for them.Therefor , I didn't yough people spend few of time to helping their communities.  

Another reason is that young people would like to enrich their experice and increase their awareness and consiciousness.
To help their communties is nessary and important. Young people will spend a lot of time to helping people who is ineed.they thinks is valuableto do this. So, I don't believed that young people don't give enough time to helping their communitied. 

All of these reasons have deeply influenced my point of view on thia issue.
That is not to say, of course ,that other points of view are completely without merit.However, I believed that the reasons I have provided in favor of my point of view are stronger."
4861,0,"I agree this satement. People always try to do the things they alredy know how to do well. But that cannot make people more creative or be more successful. If people do not try the new things how can they know their ""true"" ability. We can see lots of successful people talk about their experiments. If they always do the the things they know they can be the present them. Just as an actor, he cannot always preform the same style of movie. Therefore he can be styled by the auddience. The auddience will know that ""that is the limitation of his prefromance.  
   If the person always do the same thing that he already can do well, he won't get any growth of himself. Because he won't know what's wrong or where he shall change. Or what can make himself better. Sometimes, I would limited by this thoughts. I just want to do what I can do well. I have no confident to do the other things that I do not famliar with. By that way, I cannot learn other knowledge that I do not know. 
  I think Japanese is the good example for the successful people or the race always try new things. They make lots of new products that can connect with life. And  the company like ""3M"", the company make the product like ""Post-it"". They try new things that  the common people won't even think about. They make money by they can take risks. Before make the products, they won't know if everyone can adapt those products. But they want to try about it. They want to make new things that everybody do not see or hear before.
  That is way I agree about that successful people always try new things and take risks. Just because they can see the profits or  commercials in it. If people not try new things, they will be limited by themselves. They cannot know where is their extreme."
7874,0,"The statement states that broad knowledge in many academic subjects is better then in depth knowledge in one specific subject. On the one hand the broad knowledge gives a large picture on the issue, on the other hand specilization in one subject gives an edge in the area specific to it. However broad knowledge is better but being a specialist doesn't lessen its importance.
          Firstly, having knowledge about more then one academic subject or in fact many academic subjects helps a student or teacher to get a more larger view and the ability to see the things from more broader perspective. For ex. a person knowing chemistry and biology can definitely tell better about the details of chemical reactions taking place inside the body and its effect on it as well. 
        Secondly, having broad knowledge helps in correlating the information from various subjects and thus enables onself to give a more holistic view of different subjects related to each other. For instance, Physics and Mathematics are subjects which are related with each other. Instead of merely stating the laws, if it can be proved mathematically also then it will help the audience to have better understanding of the law and thus can be easily grasped.
      Finally, having broad knowledge gives an edge in making things interesting instead of just plain load of information from a specific subject. For ex a lecturer knowing science, maths and history can definitely deliver a better and interesting lecture then a specialist of one field.
 Having said about broad knowledge, it should not be overlooked the importance of specialist knowledge which is necessary when it requires to have indepth knowledge rather than just a good knowledge about many subjects. For ex. a zeology professor explaining intricasies about the nervous system of an animal will be expected to deliver in depth knowledge about the minutiae details which obviously requires specific knowledge and not broad knowledge.
    In the conclusion it can be said that it is true that broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better but that doesnt lessen the importance of specialize knowledge in one specific subject by any factor."

	Getting the successful is very hard because many people already effort to find the good part of successful. If some guy wants to result the best, he would find new field. For example, my grandfather has big computer company. When he was so young, he really hope to get a lof of money and be the high statues people. He tried to work field of computer 30 years ago. Many people said to him that computer business had high risk and unfamilier that times. But, he eventually get the success through the stroung spirits.
	According to the Korea Times, liking the take the risk people have more high social statues than the other people. Tend to enjoy the adventure and try some new thing personalities are the successful option in the modern global society. 
	 In conclusion, I agree that successful people try new things and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well."

     Advertisment means  announcing about some thing wheather it is good or bad. but comercially ;you do not have to show the bad qualities of your product other wise peapole will not buy it 
    for example if you advertised that your product is not suitable for olders also the youth will not buy it so you have to lie and say it is suitable for all people to give it the chance to compete 
        you have to say that your product is tcken rapidly to incourage people to try it while in fact it is stored in all shopps

Once I bought ashirt and it was advertised that absorbs sweat without harming the skin but after only one day i suffered from allergy up to two monthes after that irealized that it was not made from cotton but from pollyester 
Once again I bought a pincil and it was advertised that it will last with you for at least one year but unfortunately it was brocken at the same day

8942,0,"It is dificult to forecast the evolution of the use of cars in twenty years, because it depends on a lot of factors that could change in such a long time. However, and given the news that we are facing all days, I think is possible having an accurate idea about what the future will be, and in this future will be fewer cars.

At first, looking back to the past, we can see that the development of car manufacturing was linked to some social and economic factors. In the very beggining of car industry, a car was considered a luxurious device for most of the population, but thanks to Henry Ford, the private automobile became a popular consume good, formerly in the United States and later in Europe. In its heyday in the fifties, the american cars were a symbol of power and wealth in all the countries of the world.
Nevertheless, the environmental conditions have changed widely in the last decades. The continuous rising of the gas prices, linked to the political unstability of the leading productors; the rising of the consciousness that the planet resources are limited, and the fact that the natural environment is being harmed, have changed the attitude towards the private car. Indeed, the urban life has been severely disturbed by the wide use of cars. The possibility of using the car to conmmute everyday has created the sprawl phenomenon, with the bitter consequence of decaying inner cities, collapsed highways, destruction of farmland, pollution, and lack of social contact in the car-oriented suburbs.

Therefore, I think that the use of the car will be reduced in the future. It is necesary that all the society face the environmental and social problems that cars are creating. Of course I think that cars are useful and I drive, however, I think that cars should be used in a more smart way than today. Combinig the car with efficient public transportation networks, we will create a different and most sustainable pattern of urban growing."
8192,0,"I agree with this opinion that succeful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they arleady know to do well.

   The reason i agree with this opinion is that  succcss has something to do with people's mind.  if someone trying to something that they want to it, they can make success someday.
   Another reason is that trying to make success by developing own personality. For example, i usually rode a bike to go to school, once time i trid to drive my father's car, when i first took a car, it is really difficult for me to handle a car, but the more i drive, the easier and more intrested. 
  However, somepeople make their own success by doing only one way because they ususlly do it onething that they already know how to do well. 
   In conclusion, people who try to do new things is good."
1004,0,"I totally agree with the statement that 'It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.'

Ideas and concepts are quintessential for the development of understanding, propagation of thoughts and enrichment of students. There is a very strong relation and link that exists between learning of concepts and the ideas that lead to these concepts,or how the ideas are generated and are derived from a particular concept. All this forms the very basis of knowledge and understanding. Mere learning of facts without a background would be as futile an activity as dividing a number by zero.

For students or for any learner for that matter, what matters the most is a strong foundation that lies in conceptual knowledge. Only if the student has the basics right,  he can go on and challenge a plethora of theories or formulate hypothesis, proceed towards solving challenging problems, look at things from different perspectives, analyse situations and,may be, develop his own viewpoint on it. Learning concepts, ideas and also the interrelation between the two, leads a student to build up a knowledge that is relevant or can be definitely counted on. 

Take for instance in mathemetics if a student knows the fact that 2 plus 2 is 4, but does not know how to determine it, the fact would be of no avail. Similarly if a student of chemistry knows that water is formed by hydrogen and oxygen, but does not understand how the process has taken place the fact will be a non progressive one. Same goes for other subjects as well.

Hence ,it is absolutely necessary for a student to understand the concepts and ideas and then, if necesary, proceed towards the facts."
81,0,"Teen age is the important part of one's life.When asked who will enjoy life more between youth and older people, I will incline to youth because of their energy, enthusiasm,tenderness,dareness and zeal to learn new and pleasant ones.
Teen age from14 years to 28 years is completely filled with energy and dare blood.In that age they have oppurtunity to mould  character.Even they  can do anything like naughty things in classes to enjoying parties with friends .They will dare to do anything whatever they want because of their physical strength.
Another thing is in teen age they fill with enthusiasm.They want to learn new things and they will success too if they have interest.For this reason they want to know and learn new things they enjoy alot.
Also youth spend most of their time with friends rather than with family members.With friends they always think of entertainment  than studies .That makes youth to enjoy life than older people.
In classes too,they will enjoy life by joking or immitating lecturers or making sarcastic statements on fellow students.They will have strong desire and capability to do those things.Due to the coordination between friends they use to dowhatever they want which we will not see in case of older people.
Students can  not only enjoy life like this they even  enjoy in academics prospects too.For instance take a student who got good credits in a class.That gives him alot of enjoyment and happiness.The hardwork he has done for getting that good grade may be immense.So finally if he gets fruitful result of what he had done to achieve that thing his enjoymrnt will be at its peak.
Older people can also enjoy life but due to family problems,health problems and lack of strenght they cannot enjot life as much as a teen would enjoy.At last by the above examples and points I personally think youth especially between age 14-28 years can enjoy alot than a older person."
11896,0,"Based on my own experience and on other peoples comments about this theme I agree with the statement.

Especially today new inventions are made so quickly and life is often changing so fast. These facts bring new questions and problems to be solved and although a certain knowledge is of course necessary in every field, it is most important to be able to adapt to new situations und to be flexible in most jobs. Everyone can look up information, especially since the internet is available almost everywhere. But knowledge and skills like ""soft skills"" are kind of individual and important in every part.

I myself experienced this throughout my internship at a tourist-company last summer. Nobody asked me about numbers or specific knowledge about hotels or sights, the questions were if I could outwork an interview or if I have experience in moderating and working with groups.

In addition, I read about this topic a few times know. There was for example an interview with a popular german journalist. She explained that she studied history and politics but what she really learned at the time of her studies is how to search for information and present them to the readers or viewers. To write a paper you have to find reliable literature-sources, which isn't always easy,  but a skill you may need later as a journalist or if you want to manage a project of something specific.

All in all, I think it is better to teach ideas and concepts to todays students than make them learn facts because that way they get the ""tools"" to succeed in managing new situations and challenges."
6903,0,"The idea of whether broading knowledge of many academic subjects than specialize and focus in one specific subject has been a matter of debat recently in many countries. In my point of view, I believe that broading different many knowledge will give studnt the ability and the basic background to understand the real life to be able to disscuss different subjects, argue in many issues, and to improve himself. Also, be awaring of many academic subjects will give the studnt the ability to go through different fields and chose the best major he wants to drill in.
       I believe that spread more than one subject in the academic year especially in the first and second years will allow the student to be aware of what is going around his world. Studnt who is going to study about education, social studies, Politics, Arts, and may be Math will be able to understand his country and his socity peroblems and will have more ideas than a student who never heared about politics or arts and only study for his math major. 
    Moreover, students in their first year will never be able to take the right decision for their career life and chossing the major they want to enroll-in as they dont have the enough knowledeg and experiance to chose among all these alternatives. For example, in my first year and directly after the high school I had to chose my career and my whole future based on my zero experiance and approximatley zero knowledge, of course if in my country i was able to gain and aquire the basics of more than a knowledge absolutly i was going to chose something else or if i didnt chose something else;at least i would know that my choice was the right chice for me.
    To conclude,  I STRONGLY recommend and agree with having broad  knowaledge of many academic subjects before focusing in the specific field of knowledge which I believe it will be the best for my future career and which will be helpful for my socity."

6495,0,"Nowadays it's very important to have a good academic formation to get an interesting job and realize yourself, but this should be reached in two ways: a broad knowledge and a specific knowledge.
I'm italian, so I'm influenced by the italian typical school system based on a big knowledge of many subjects.
In fact when I was at school I studied a lot of subject, including Latin and ancient Greek, and when I was at the university I took twentyfive exames on different aspects of economics.
I think that it's important to have a broad knowledge of many subjects because today when you work you need to be more flessible than before; a lot of things are changed and it's quite different from the beginning of the twentieth century when Ford teorized the ""work specialization"".
But, probably in some case it should be different; for example an ingeneer needs to know a lot of things in a specific subject and he must specialize in a specific construction sector, and, I think, it's similar for medicians.
On the other hand, my preparation is general because I would become a manager, and it's konw that a manager must be resolve a lot of different problems in different ways, you may use your ability to find new solution to the problems.
For example, if you have a problem selling a product because the market doesn't like it, you have two choises: the first is to retire the product from the market and second one, which is more creative, is to find a good marketing solution to make the product ""pulled"" by the market.
In conclusion, I think that you must choos your formation depending on your interests and your future job."

Sometimes, doing what you do well  is the most risky thing to do. Although people who only moves in the safe area seem to be scared of the world around, maybe when your field is too wide, doing only one thing is the best way to succeed. Even if you are not playing a leading roll in society or in your work, and you are developing a secondary thing, you can profit. The thing is that you may not be taking all the stuff life brings you, and due to that you are leaving by lots of happiness you could have.

On the other hand we have the one who takes every chance, every risk to get where he or she wants to be. This is associated to leading aptitudes that implies a more intense view of life. By trying new things, you get lots of differents experiences that enrich your life, you can make a lot of friends, know more about different things, colaborate in other different fields... That does not mean that everything is going to be easy, on the contrary, there is going to be pain, there is going to be a lot of hard work but also lots of happiness, not only due to every  experience but also because that at the end you will know  you have taken the challege  of life.

565,0,"I would agree with the statement that ""it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialise in one specific subject""
I think it is  wise to be a 'jack of all trades but may be master of none'.
If one knows sufficient about many subjects but not everything about a particaular subject then he might not be able to top any subject but atleast he would not fail any of the subjects and if he performs reasonably ok in most  then his overall performance would certainly be enhanced. Also it is always helpful in daily life aswell as in terms of future prospects  if one has a broad academic knowledge.This would open him to far more career opportunities than if he limits his knowledge to only certain subjects.
Say for example , in high school ,some one who has scored grade 'A' in physics or mathematics while grade 'c' in all other subjects , although may be able to get into a top class engineering university but would not have much other choices left incase he decides not to go for engineerin.On the other hand ,if one scores a 'B' in most of his subjects he may not be able to get into the top class college but would certainly manage in a fairly good college and at the same time enjoy the liberty of having many career options to choose.
This also comes into play when one is applyinfg for jobs in future as the person having knowledge in various academic fields would find himself in a situation where he could apply in various institutions.
Also in place of his work, he might someday make use of his knowledge in other academic fields than what he is currently practicing , helping him handle a critical situation better and attain more success at work and a thus a brighter future ahead.
To summerise , knowledge never goes waste. So its better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects.Although exceptions might be there, as they always are, but in the long run it helps to have a broader spectrum of knowledge."
10128,0,"In my opinion this statement is true. I think this is since young people are at the beginning of there lives and not in the middle or at the end of it. You can reccognise it if you start a new work. Generally at the beginning it is interesting, because you have never done it before, but after a few weeks or month you know how to do it and it is becoming less interesting.

Here are some examples why from my point of view, young people enjoy it more to live than old people. When you are young you have a lot of changes. You grow up, become interested in the other sex and have to go to school. You have not to be concerned about that you have enough money neither if you have a job or not. It does not care you. 
On the other hand it really depents on how people have planed there lives. The most grown up people I know, have a house or an appartement somewhere, children and a job. Those people have really not a lot of changes in there lives. The time schedule is nearly every week the same. 
However I know some other peoples who have a completly different way of live. For example one guy I know, he is 50 years old now, stopped to work with fourty. He has had the opinion that he owns enough money to live on with for the rest of his live. So he bought a sailing boot to travel around the world. He works from time to time if he can at a bare in Jamaica, but only one ore two months in a year. 
I think in his case the mentioned statement is wrong. He never stoped to be young. I think that he enjoys everz daz like it would be his first on this planet. With this sentence I would like to say that the sentence wich I am writing about is not absolutely true. However generally I have the same impression."

Maybe he don't know why or when, but he did it.And you can check it with simple problems of the life for exemple, so if  you consider that you know it because it's simple, you wrong , all can be resume by ower experiences or facts of experiences of another one.And maybe the stronger proof that I can done, it's when you are in a somewhat difficult ideas and concepts, you are obliged to take in count the facts to undertstand the idea,because you can't did it whithout.

8284,0,"The young people of today are a much more informed and aware group of people than young people in the past ever were. They are the future of society and community and ofcourse have a big role to play in giving back to and helping their communities. It is unfair to say that they do not give enough time to helping their communities. I am of the opinion that young people nowadays give as much if not more time than the youth of years gone by ever did to helping their communities. The youth of today having had more oppurtunities than youth of yester years ever did have benefited greatly from the same.

There are several examples from recent years that go on to prove how young people have devoted a lot of their time and energy towards forwarding a cause that is related to their communities. As a particular example, one may look at the anti firecracker drives undertaken by young people across several regions during festive seasons. Such campaigns are aimed at issues ranging from reducing the pollution levels experienced due to bursting of firecrackers to more grave topics such as tackling child labour (often being emplyed in fire cracker factories). However, some may argue that as a movement such anti-firecracker drives may be instigated not by young people themeselves; but the fact remains that such drives are successfull only due to the active participation and support of young people. And we have sufficient evidence to belive that these movements are more successful today than they ever were in the past.

Another example is that of community service programs initiated in several private schools over the past few years. It is now compulsory in several schools to complete a certain number of community service hours. What is most heartening is that I myself have experienced first hand how many students are interested in devoting more time than is compulsarily required of them. A myriad of social service clubs have formed in schools. In my own school, such a club was in the nascent stages when I graduated. Once again, cynics may argue it is not the youth themselves who are jumping in on community service; but the bottomline is that the average school going student today probably spends a lot more time in community service than a student did ten or twenty years ago.

One arguement that must be put forth to make the case for the young people today even stronger is the current state of growth and development of communities in different regions. Barring a few exceptions, the standard of living of people has gone up over time and therefore so has the standard of the community that houses these people. In my opinion, it is not possible to explain such an improvement in community life without giving some credit to the young people of the community. Even if the younger people may not be at the helm of organising community get-togethers and events, they are most often the ones that participate heartily in the same. Such active participation definately goes to help their communities develop."
8183,0,"I disagree with the steatement because, in my opinion, it is better have a lot of knowledge about one specific subject, that to know only a little of many academic topics.
On the one hand, even though a lot of persons can think that having information about a variety of subjects could make a professor or a student to have a better backwround in his or her professional formation, on the other hand, I consider it is negative not to have a deep knowledge of one main area. Is always better to understand perfectly one thing than to have a small idea of many things.
Thereby, to have a large knowledge in one single academic subject have practical applications because, it will be easier for that person to trasmit well consolidated information to others.
Moreover, some specifics points of the academic life, according to my opinion, can only be achieved with a huge knowledge of one topic. For instance, to make a research in one area, it will be necesary to count with a lot of information in that subject. However, to have an idea of several topics will be useless to develope deepely enough the investigation accuratelly.
Furthermore, to understand perfectly one single subgect could have potentially a large economic benefit, for in some circunstances, diferent companies and industries needs persons with specific knowledge about one area to solve a punctual problem. 
In conclusion, I believe that to focus oneself in studing deeply a single subject instead of studing a large number of academic areas will bring always more possitive results."
8988,0,"The advertisement of a product is important because of the its role on the people`s decision making. Companies have to use advertisements in order to sell their products. A good advertisement introduce the product in a simple way. If it introduces the product better than itself, it can cause decrease in product sales, contrastly.

When people decide which product to buy and use, they are influenced by advertisements mostly. The efectiveness of an advertisement can be provided by making it in a qualified way, using it in the popular media devices, and repating it many times. The advertisements which does not reflect the true properties of the product can also make people to buy it. However, later on, the users can decide not to use of the product. Moreover, the company of the product can lose trust among the people. So, other products that are produce by that company may have a decrease in the sales. 

In addition to this, advertisements usually claim that their product is the best. There is no `best` product since the perfectness changes among users of the product. Everyone can want different type of specifications from the product. Thus, the `best` product for someone may be a loser for another user. As a result it is not true to introduce products as they are the best.

Consequently, companies can advertise wrongly about their products to sell it more because of the competetive environment in the market sales. However, in spite of making wrong advertisements, they should try to produce more qualified products. And also they can try to reduce the cost of the products to sell them more. This will make the company trustable and also will increase other products` sales."
7103,0,"This is a tipical statement that shows a view of the world in which young people refuse responsabilities and problems having fun in their community while older people, growing up, lose this sense of fresh and spontaneous life. 
This statement is known in our society probably because we are used to see young people studing, not working, and taking part to many activities, something as sports or community initiatives. So for us become old means adapting to the rules that civil society, good manners and behaviour require. This passage has always been seen as the increasing awareness of what surrounds us, with all the problems and responsabilities. Probably for that reason old people are considered more serious, understanding, but also sed compered to the brave and spontaneus behaviour of young people. 
Anyway my personal opinion is that times are changed and today our world offeres a lots of opportunuties and means to old people in order to mantain reactive body and mind. there are many cases of no more young people that are considered example of our society and I think that this shows the change now expained. I know many people older that me that enjoy and love life as me, because they love their work or they have started some interestig activities that enable them to be active and positive.

660,0,"In a way, I disagree with the statement that Young people nowadays do not devote enough time in helping their community. I beleive that in the current times, communities themselves do not require much help or much time in help. 
In the past, people of a small town or a village identified themselves as a community and worked towards mutual and communal benefit.
There were weekly meetings and the problems of the community were discussed. Young people who form the most energetic part of the group volunteered in solving the problems and in arranging festivals and local gatherings.
People were more physically involved the community. They worked as a team and one's problem was everybody's problem. It was natural for young people to be the most active component of the community.

In many modernised parts of the world, the situation is in stark contrast to what it was in the past. The revolutions in communication technology and the advent of the internet has largely devated people from each other to the computer.
Systems and services have become more efficient and computerized.There is much less need for people , not only young to be involved in any help mainly because there is not much help required. People can discuss problems in e-communities and via email and chat.
The town administration has it's public website and any problem can be posted on it. Responsible people can then take necessary action.
so today, there is not much help required but there is a big need for ideas and in this case young people still form the most active group. 

So in view of the current times, I disagree."
5134,0,"As i'm doing engineering studies, the question of take my courses on one specific subject or on many various themas occured to me several times.
My choices follow the way of a broad knowledge, excepted the last year : I prefer to specialize myself in only one subject during one year. So why ?
The first reason is that studies in diverse academic subjects give you a large view of how take a problem when it occurs. You can have many ways to develop a solution which could respond to your problem. If you studied only one subject, your mind is focused on one method which could finish in a dead end. For example in microelectronics, a friend of mine proposed a solution using his knowledges in mechanics !
Another reason for learn about diverse themas could be to understand the world we are living in. History, geography, economy, physics, mathematics, and languages are essential to see follow our changing environment every days, not only at home, but also when we're working. For instance, social sciences could help you to understand why your boss is in a bad mood today, and maybe learn you not to ask him some things which could be desastrous...
My last argument  for broad knowledge would be your abilities you can have to change of job, or decrease your time of adaptation when you enter a new firm.
Nevertheless, the specialization is - I think - also very important. It will be the first thing a manager will notice when you will present him your resume, when you apply for your first job.
Moreover it is interesting when you study to keep time to make a deep analysis on subjects you prefer. It will be give you the qualification of expert on the matter.
Eventually, as i want to have some managerial responsabilities, i choose to diversify my studies."
6739,0,"The one of  my favorite hobby is traveling.I disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. I think,when I travel without any tour guide, I can go any place which I would like to go, and I can find my favorite places or things,and I can get more strong friendships.
	Fistly, without any tour guide, our travel will be more flexible for planning where to go or when to go.In my case, when I traveled with a tour guide, there was the place where I wanted to stay for more longer time,but he said ""we must go to next."" I felt unsatisfied.
	Secondly,it is possible for me to find a place or a thing which is not so famous.That is to say, I will get my own special place or thing.I do not like crowded place,so if I can find unfamous,but very good place or thing for me,I think I am happy.
	Finally, if there is no guide for our group, we will get togehter to make our travel more precious. I have a friend good at making a schedule,so with her I feel more happy,and our travel will become more valuable,moreover,our friendship will become more strong.

617,0,"Some people claim that sucsesfull people are only working hard, while others like me fully agree that success dependts on trying and searching.
The first point i would like to make is that there are strong advantages to work in a same way. One benefit of working in the same way is not becoming any risks. You won`t fall down. For instance, my father who is a mechanical mechanical engineur. He worked 30 years for one company so became enough money and promitions. He started as a basic engineur and he became his promotions with his hard work. He hadn`t got any stress because the company doesn`t care him he cares only his work. Undoubtedly, not taking risks means a healty, relax and safety life. 
Though there are strong advantages to working in a same way there are some even more compelling advatages for me to work with risks. When you take risks the income will be more. For example, I`m a mechanical engineur like my father but i want to have my own company so i can take more risks for making my company bigger. This risks will be enjoyable too because i like this style of life. More than that, i can learn a lot of things with my risks. The income will be always bigger with risks. In addition, without risks a person couldn`t be enough creative. With the help of the stress our body has got more adrenalin which means more creativity and better work. This is a biological truth and would make us successful.
In conclusion, i fully advocate to taking risks will make someone more successful. Everyone can work hard on a same thing but successfulness depends on creativity which is the result of risks."
2250,0,"Some people believe that braod knowledge of various academic subjects is more important than a special skill in one specific subject. In contrast, others think that specialized skill in a certain subject is much more profitable, because one can become the best in that certain field. I personally support the former idea, because having broader knowledge of diverse subjects indicates that this could be applied more often in reality and bring advantages when deciding one's career.

Firstly, by having diverse knowledge of various academic subjects, I can find out in which subject my talent lies. For example, one can attend numerous classes, such as mathematics, psychology, geography, biology and other. However, the person can find out that he/she is only talented in subjects like calculous and science  but is  terrible in biology and history classes. Thus, the person can find out where his/her talent is and be able to make clear and benefitial decision for his/her future career. Not to mention that being knowledged in various fields, one is not restricted in one area when deciding his career or talent.

Moreover, people can apply their various skills in numbers of areas. Reason being, if a person is only specialized in one area, he cannot contribute to other fields of work. However, being knowledgeable in diverse areas, even when he/she faces challenging situation, the person can  easilly apply his knowledge and therefore ameliorate the situaltion. Additionally, when someone is in dire need of help, the person with broad knowledge can use his surviving skills to rescue the person. In fact, knowledgeable in only one specific subject, often one cannot be well informed about what he/she must do when the person face emergency.

In conclusion, even though being specialized in one specific subject is  also benefitial, I believe that having broad knowledge of numerous areas is much more practical and advantageous. This is largely because, people can find out their true talent and more often apply those knowledge in reality."
173,0,"Behind the idea of education, there lies the ability to understand ideas and concept. Thus, the aim of education -as I understand- is to teach students understanding the basic ideas and conceptualizations upon which the individual student can independently learn facts. Without such an understanding no fact can be learned. In the due course, I totally agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts.
As to begin with, without ideas and concepts facts do not have any meaning. Although such a statement might sound too large, it is actually true in the sense that anyone can learn a fact by reading the newspaper or watching the television. However, such a learning leaves no room for questioning and basing the facts on concepts and ideas of other people. Therefore, students firtst must be taught the important concepts and ideas. For instance, a student who knows a theory on inequality or developmentalism would look at the facts about povery  from a very different and critical point of view. With the ideas of others and conceptualizations that have been made, the student does not readily take the things that she learns as given. Rather, the students tends to compare and contrast with other ideas and try to base the fact on different concepts. In the due course, first the student should try to understand ideas and concepts.
In addition to this, another reason why I think it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts is that facts sometimes be misleading or misinterpreted. When the student is directly confronted with facts to be learned, she takes the knowledge for granted and does not question the validity or trueness of that fact. For example, sometimes we are confronted with false news on media. Such fallicies are only visible to the open eye of the students or people who are well equipped with ideas and concepts. Another example to this is Hrant Dink's - a famous journalist in Turkey- death because of his statements of Turkish nationality. He was murdered by a young nationalist boy who only knows facts about nationalism; yet, he has never understood the ideas and concepts of Turkish nationalism. 
All in all, it is plausible to suggest that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. I agree with this statement due to the fact that learning facts by themselves alone does not mean anything but  taking given facts as absolute truths and the fact that facts might me misleading sometimes. Without understanding the ideas of other people and conceptualizations that have been made on different issues, learning facts has no validity. Thus, students should first understand ideas and concepts and upon such an understanding facts should be learned."

7337,0,"People usually say that young people are the future of our socieies. It is because they have much more time to think about their rest of lives and their futures. In addition they have a lot of opportunities to learn and try what they want. Moreover, young people are usually very healthy to do something hard thing that they face on. Therefore, I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more that older people do.
 Firstly, older people have less time to consider and already experienced many things that can enjoy their lives. Young people are literally 'young', so they have lots of time to think about their lives. Also they have much more opportunities to learn and try what they want than order people. For example, young people have a lot of dreams in their futures ,so they are always consider what they really want to be. Therefore, they spend a lot of time to learn new things that they have never experienced, but older people already experienced most of things in their lives so not a lot of things are left for them. In addtion, young people have enthusiasm to try new and hard things which can definitly enjoy their lives. Although things are hard and difficult have have youth passion to figure out but old people are not really facinated in difficult and dangerous fields. 
 Secondly, older people are not often healtier than young people. For instance, older people can not run as fast as young people. Therefore, although older people want to hike Rocky Mountain, they can afford to hike as much as they want. On the other hand, young people are very healthy to try whatever they want, even though things are very difficult and dangerous. In addition, although they get injured, their bodies are easily get better than older people.
 In conclusion, young people have much more time to enjoy their lives such as thinking about their future, learning new skills and experiencing new things. Moreover they are heathy to enjoy these new experiences and skills than older people. Therefore, young people enjoy their lives more than older people do."

So many young guys today are helping other people to manage their life. I live in a small city called Erding and also in such a small city a club to help students to get better marks established. I joined this club one year ago and first I was surprised how much young people were offering there help there. All of this people are graduate students who use their free time after beeing in their courses and classes to spend it at teaching other students. A major fact is that the other guys and me do not earn a lot of money by this activity. Since my first visit in the club I have been doing private lessons once a week. And I think it is a great honor to see the person teached by you getting better and better grades.
I also have a friend who supports a poor family in Asia with 400 Euros a month. Without that help they could not even buy clothes for all of them. 400 Euros is quite a lot of money also for the european way of life. But the girl works hard for beeing able to afford this project. 
Another example for proving my statement given above are many other students and friends of mine. I have already asked many people for their opinion about the fact that many older poeple that the younger ones do not care about the environment surrounding them. Most of them refused to join the military after finishing school. Instead they did a social work. This would be for example helping older poeple to get to the supermarket or to the church. And surprisingly every one of the enjoyed his job. Everyone agreed that they gained a lot of social experience whithin this time. 
To sum up I would say that young people often are misunderstood. They are neither laisy nor not willing to offer their help. You can find young poeple all over the social environment working for free and helping the people who need this help."

Some people say that spacializing in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge of many academic. However , I oppose the idea for two reason . First, it allows  students to have diverse job's opportunities. Second, it is beneficial to choose the major.

To begin with, it enables students to get various job's opportunies. It is known that when students in university have diverst information about other fields exept for their own major, they can get a good job easily. Let me give my friend  for an example. One of the my best friends  has built  broad knowledge for a long time at an early age. So, he got better jobs than me . That is because he can have many options on jobs. If he would not have broad knowledge of many academic, he could not get  a job that he want to .

On top of that , it is beneficial to select the major . Today's many student in high school have a cercorn about their major in the university . That is due to the fact that they should have chosen the university . For example, my brother is in high school students. He has a worry about his major that he do in the university. So, his professor gives many advises for his major . Fortunitly, he can dicide his major that is art.

                          Having broder knowledge is always useful. One should have a broader perspective of all subjects at school level and college level .This provides them with a carrier option  who are really confuse what to choose as there future and what they are good at.knowledge is helpful in every walk of life. 
                   People here are really confused about distributng and how to utilize their knowledge.      
                             One should understand that knowledge is never wasted.If one is gaining masters degree for instance he cannot do masters in all subjects.In that case he has to choose a specific subject.

10903,0,"If you have a choice to travel around the country, will you go along by yourself or travel in a group ead by a tour guide? As for me,  I will take the second answer and I believe this the  best way to use in the travel, for the following reasons:

First and fore most, traveling in a group and accompanied by a tour guide gives me more knowledge and pleasure in my tour. Compare to travelling alone, the tour guide may tell us more background information, stories  of the sighting and also introduces many local cultrual matters or traditional habits. These great information certainly enhences my trip and makes me be knowledgalbe to where I have been visited. 

In addition, it is suah a good way to use my money and time wisely in the tour. Travelling in a group will absolutely save my money and time. For instance, other group members and I share the same bus, we book the hotel with lower price and our schedule is highly planed before we go. Thes significant parts offers me a more economic travel than my travelling alone.

Last but not the least, it makes me meeting a lot of new friends in my tour group and my travel is full of fun. It is benificial for travelling together with others rather than by oneself alone simply because I make friend with our group members and share the happiness with them.

In a conclusion, travelling in a group and being led by a tour guide is the best way to experience and enjoy my tour."
5192,0,"I partly agree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use then there are today in twenty years.
I do agree partly with this statement because of several reasons.
Firstly, we live in a world that constantly changes. If I talk to my grandparents or even my parents today, it is astounding how much the world has changed during there life's. This is why I think is likely that this will continue. 
Regarding cars it is obvious for me that there will have to be changes.
For one, the gas is getting more and more expensive. Therefore, people have to think about cheaper ways to travel and transport things as well as themselves. 
As a matter of fact, one can already realise the fact that people are trying to use their car less often than a few years ago. The train is even used more and the German train company states in its advertisment states that going by train often is much cheaper than driving a car.
Additionally, it is not only a matter of money, but also a matter of the protection of the environment. Even if the gas was not as expensive as it is now, there would have to be a change. The air pollution produced by the cars nowadays is too dangerous for all the people living in the world. It will and it has already caused serious problems. 
This is why I think and why I hope that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are now. 
However, it is an illusion  to think that we can live without cars or even with a lot fewer cars. People are too used to use their cars all the time. This is why there has to be another way. The governments all over the world should invest in the discovery of new ways of transportation. For instance to use solar engergy to run different cars. 
This is why I only partly agree with the statement. If the people do not try to find different, cheaper and less dangerous, ways for transportation, there will be no way that the number of cars decreases within in the next twenty years.
Furthermore, I can not really imagine that the number of cars will decrease a lot in as much as twenty years. But it could start to decrease which would be a step in the right direction.
All in all, I think especially because of financial problems that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today, even if it is going to be hard for most people not to use their car anymore."

	The purpose of advertisments is making products lively, since most of products can not talk for themselve. For example,

7242,0,"In my opinion, I agree with the statement that it is the best way to travel in a group which led by a tour guide. And my reason is basic on following reasons.
  Firstly, traveling with a tour group is safer than traveling alone, being taken by a tour guide, you can go to anywhere which have security garentee, otherwise, it is dangerous for you to go to a strange city without someone taking you.
  Secondly, a tour guide can tell you were to go and what to see, obviously, they know better than we do, being taken by a tour guide, you can make your trip worth, and you won't wast your money which you spend on this trip.
  Thirdly, if you go to a foreign country where the people speak foreign language that you can't understand, it will be very difficult for you to communicate with others when you want to buy someting or ask fordirections, in that case you need a tour guide to help you.
   In conclution, it is better for us to have a tour guide and travel in group, because it's safer, and you can receive more help."

3687,0,"Recently, many students try to find an effective and efficient way to study, but they are always confused by the dilema: Understanding ideas is the first priority or learning facts is more important? From my point of view, it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts other than learning facts. And this can be fully explained from three aspects: First, nowdays people have more access to those facts so they don't have to memorize them; Second, Understanding is more essential to help student to be more adaptable; Third, understanding helps students to develop creativity, which is the key force in this technology world.

First of all, facts are easy to be found. Nowadays people have a variety of ways to acquire data and information. Books, magazines, Internet, video tapes are all the powerful resources which help students to learn facts. For example, a student can easily get what happened in Canada in 1870 from the internet, He or she just simply type: ""What happened in Canada in 1870"", he or she can get thousands of ariticles and tests which are related to the topic. Moveover, the informaiton is saftely saved and preserved from all those medias mentioned before, so what is the point to try to memorize all the terms and fact? It is a waste of time obviously.

Second, Understanding is more important to get ideas. It is better to teach a man fishing skills other than just give him fishes everyday. For example, if you just memorize ""1+1=2, 1+2=3, 1+3=4....""but don't know really understand the concept of the rule of addition, next time I give you a question ""1+100=?"", you still don't know how to do it. On the other hand, if you know the rule of addition, that's much enough. You don't have to memorize any facts such as""1+56=57"", you can do any addition questions. That simple.

Last but not least, understanding helps students to be more creative. As we know, this is a technology era, creativity seems more important than just accepting. In order to understand, a student has to push himself thinking in a deep level, which helps to develop logical thinking and critical thinking skills. The more a person thinks, the more knowledgable he or she tend to be. Hence, he or she will understand more and be more creative. This is simply because they can apply what they have learned and understanded into different situation.

In conclusion, learning facts is simple and brutal while understanding is deep and essential. Understanding ideas can let students be more knowlegable and creative while passively accepting and memorizing facts is just a waste of time. So it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts."
5471,0,"CITIES TWENTY YEARS LATER
	How will our cities be in the future? How will people live twenty years from now? These are questions asked for so many years and we can see many different answers, theories and approaches through out history. When trying to answer these questions, the key aspects of cities such as traffic and car  use come into the picture. I believe that, in terms on car use in the city, there will not be significant decrease in the number of cars used and even more cars will be used in twenty years.
	There are several aspects effecting the car use today. The main element is the car-dependent life style of modern people living in the cities. I believe that the city life of the near future will as car dependant as today or even more. Cities evolve and continue to get bigger counting on the mobility of the people. As new suburbs are created and cities with multiple city centers away from each other, are developed; as the current situation in Istanbul nowadays more and more people will need to use cars. 
	The only reason for fewer cars to be used in the near future would be the concept of working from home using the internet. People can argue that when people will have the chance to live and work in one place - the home office concept, they will not need to use cars. However the concept of a home ofiice is not that new and in the  past 10 or 15 years many people tried to work from home but ended up going back to their offices. Big companies are not supporting people working from home, on the contrary they are trying to create better and more confortable working environments in and around the city. 
	Based on what I see in my own country (Turkey) and many other developing countries I can say that more and a lot of money is invested in the car industry, highways, tunnels and bridges making it easier and necessary for people to use cars. Therefore I believe that in twenty years there will be more cars in use than there are today."
1382,0,"I totally agree with this idea. This statement is an summary of all scientist, explorers etc. I think this statement has something to do with personal values. Some people are ready to use sth which someone else has already did it or worked on it. These kinds of people think that they are very clever. Is it really so? In the short term, they are succesful. But in the long term, they are not. What happens is they can not improve themselves for the future. There is saying ""Education or Training goes on through our lifetime"". Everybody has to do sth at a definite period of his/her life. If we want to be successful at the end, we must keep trying and taking risks. That brings to a conlusion that in our life there are things we can learn from our family members, teachers in the school and there are things we  need to learn by ourselves.  Those who do not try and take risk, they can never learn anything new. So, in our society, there becomes a group of people at the same level of information. By the time, people who try new things and take risk train themselves. 
At the beginning of my essay, I mentioned that trying is personal way of life. Personally I always try new things even though there is a risk to fail. After 20 years, I see those people not taking risks are at the same level of their life. They always need somebody to teach them. 
I n our daily life we say experiment, experiment...This is a tool for scientific developments. If we look at those scientist lived in the  past, they did not innovate or discover sth at their firts attempt. It requires lots of time to reach a conlusion on spesific subject. Let's look at the human life. In the old days, man were living in a very bad and poor conditions. Years and years after, man is exploring life out of our earth. How did we manage to come to a level like this? By trying, taking risk. To fly in the air, many people have been sacrificed."

I think also that it depends in what I must do. There are many activity, like this test, that I have to do in the better way I know. If I use a grammar structure that I don't comprend very well, I will probably take a mistake.
In contrast if I have to succeed in a research I will take many risks like speak about mysterios or not well-known issues.
All of the important person of history took risks in our life, like Cesare or Napoleone.
Now I'm taking a big risk. I'm doing this exam without a large preparation in American language but I'm sure I can do it in the better way I can.
My life is full of risk, and I love to take many risks in order to see if I can succeed in it and in order to test my abilitity to do different types of activity, not well-known one too.
If I don't take these risks I will never know if I'm a person with big value.

4297,0,"Communities have been there for the people themselves in making their lives easier. During ancient times communities meant a lot to those(people) who belong to them.  Does the communities still have the same significanace in one's life , now? Absolutely no, thats what that could be seen. So obviously people are not giving enough time for them.

With the advent of industrialization people are getting more and more mechanical and self -involved than ever before. Since nowadays they there are things which doesn't need involvement. For example if want to buy  fruits, all you need to to is to go to supermarket and pay there and return back, but it was different earlier when people were using barter system there it required more interaction among people and consequently more interaction with the communities.

With the mechanical life people have comparatively very less time  even for themselves and for their families so it is not surprising if they do not have a lot of time for their communities.

Industrialisation not only brought machanical life but also devaluation of the emotions. People not only devalue the morals but also the significance of community, 

People now have more greed for money and less heed for the values. All what people can do for their communities is donating money but it is not always the best way. For example, in most of reputed colleges rich alumunis feel a sense of doing for the betterment of their communities by donating huge amount of money but sometimes it's not the money but rather the need of their expertise, their experience etc, but unfortunately this all requires time which might not be available to them. 

So, we can see that community's significance has decreased, it could be accounted to the industrialization which made people's life more individualized, paying more attention towards money than the rest with no time for community. Therefore, one can be agreed with
the statement that "" Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities"""

6581,0,"A lot of people always ask: ""would be better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjets than to specialize in one specific subject"", and I always base my answer in my personal opinion to answer yes. I answer with a yes because if I have knowledge in many academemic subjects, I will have more options to find a job. I say is important to have knowledge in many subjetcs because the live in every country is different.  The life is like fill with stones where you need to be prepare to move to do not fall.

I am a high school student hopping to get accepted in a university. I want to major in physics. I do not know if I will be able to find a job when I finish college, but I am sure the most I know, the more opportunities I will have to find a job. In the life is necessary to know a little bit of anything.

This is simple. I am from Ecuador, and in my country the life is very difficult. If I have knowledge in a specific subjet, I am no going to have any money to live like a normal person, this means, I can not  pay for my food, I can not pay a place to live, and I can not pay  my studies.

The life has stones. If I am invited to a important phisics meeting, I  would know I am going to participate in the meeting, but what will happen if somebody ask me something different than physics, and I do not have an answer. I will be remember that pour situation for years and I do not want that.

3206,0,"I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.
One of the best examples that comes to mind from my personal experience is a McDonalds burger. Have you ever seen a McDonalds commercial on TV or in a magazine? The burgers look big, juicy and fresh. Every time I see one of their ads on TV I want to run to the nearest McDonalds to buy a Big Mac! The problem is that when I get there and actually buy one of their burgers I am always left very disappointed. The burger looks in no way alike to the ones you see on TV. It's smaller and it surely doesn't look as fresh. The taste at the end is ok but the fact remains that their ads would never show what their real burgers look like. Otherwise nobody would ever feel the urge to go out and buy one.
Advertisements are therefore misleading. Not always but very frequently. Having said this, if I were to make a commercial to try to sell one of my products, I would probably do exaclty the same thing. If everyone is doing it, I don't want to be the only one being honest because this would negatively effect the sales of my product. 
The only way to solve the problem is to help the whole advertising community to be honest. We should always remember that consumers are not stupid. They can be naive at first, but not stupid. You can fool a consumer once, but the consumer will never go back to you again if he is not satisfied with your product. At the end of the day, it probably doesn't pay to delibarately fool consumers. They will find out sooner or later and they will punish you. This being said, everyone is always going to try make their products seem a little more appealing to the public. This will never cease. But the consumer knows this and is aware of this. 
In conclusion, I will always go back to McDonalds not because of the commercial I see on TV but because I like the taste of their Big Macs even though they look disgusting!"
2340,0,"Every coin has two side
     A broadknowledge of many academic subjects, specializing in one specific subject, which is better option in the practice? I have to categrized this issue into two part just as every coin has two side.
    On one side, it's better to have a broad knowledge of subjects in the condition that you are a undergraduate student. For the younger students--undergraduate student, they are not ready for a specialized study. I am also a undergraduate student . I can recognize that current courses for a undergraduate student is more generalize and widespread. One isn't able to have a deep understanding of a certain subject beofore he/she learn the more subjects in his major and understand more common sense . It's obviously that the common sense in a certain field can help get a job or help he/she prepare for the consititute 
    On the other hand, suppose you're a graduate student , a deep undertanding of several or single subject is necessary. The graduate will be a expert in a single fileds,which need more knowledge and experience of the narrow field rather than a wide understanding of several easiler common sense. In the information age nowadays, more and more  positions in some field appear which require speciliazation as the society develops ,which is such as in high technology companiesand bank. More experts are needed to fill any blank of such positioins. 
    To sum it up , we need to recgnize that the society has many different roles for each student. You can't define wich is wright or wrong if you don;t know the specific condition a person is facing. In a word, both method of agree or disgree with the topic statement has i"
8797,0,"Life is a game it is to enjoy in the right path but its not bed of roses unfortunately.The word enjoy is a word which people universally are familiar with and there no human who does not want to enjoy life.The preference in the way to enjoy life might differ from person to person.Enjoying the one which we all like makes us happy ,keeps us away from problems which we think of all the time and brood over it.Enjoyment does improve the life style and the way we look at our lives.We do learn much while we enjoy something we relish.


But people do have certain restrictions as they grow old it might be the decrease in interest ,mental stress,much work,heavy responsibilities and ofcourse health conditions.There is the fact that its how an individual wants to lead life.

I personally feel that the younger generation these days are enjoying more than the older people do that could be mainly because there are many areas which offer people to enjoy especially for the youngsters.Secondly the youngsters of today are much bold and courageous and the way they look at lfe is diffrent than how the older people do.

The youngsters are much aware of what is happening in and around the world and even that arouses the scope to enjoy.Even the stress that younger people have theses days is much ,which ever field they are up to stresses them and thats because we are into the computer world and the rate of competition is much higher and keeps growing and hence to over come the amount of stress and to stay away from the stress is to enjoy thats the only way one can do

When i was kid there were hardly any house that had a Television but now every house does have and most of the children love watching television they really enjoy it.There were no computers in houses 22 years back but today most children enjoy playing games ,watch a  movie ,browse the net,chat and so on.


As people have changed there life styles even the society builds much more corners giving the way for the younger people to choose what they like to enjoy the most.Younger people enjoy concerts both jazz and pop.There are places for the week ends that  does give way for the youngsters to dance and relax themselves.There are resorts in almost all places where the youngsters can hang around in the weekends and in the holidays.


Thirdly  there are wide ranges which one can choose to enjoy life and it is also safer and healthier.Which ever one chooses its within his or her own reach.

Certainly the stress , the explosure to the world ,the rate of competition,the wide varities one can choose is making youngsters enjoy life better or more than older people."
11163,0,"Advertising is growing more and more everyday. I agree with the point that says advirtising is showing us that the commercial product is really needed while its not. like a commecial that we dont have to use it in your life at all couse for me, i dont have to use it.
      like someone telling you that my 15 years old doughter wants to buy any product that she see in the TV to show her to her friends at school or becouse its just in the TV. And also for no reason to use it while she dont need it, she just want to buy it.
      Also i agree that we sometimes need to see, read and watch about that commecial prudacts to know about things which its useful for our life while we dont know about it at all or we just dont know what is the prudact is needed for. Although they are playing with our minds by using a fake results they got or when the dont show us the bad effects of the prudact the are advertising about.
      Additionally, commercial advsrtising is taking a big part of our life becouse its around us wherever we go, like in the streets while we are driving our cars, the resturants, and any place where its making an attention. 
      I also beleive that its also effecting our daily life becouse i could buy an advertising news paper just to look at the advertising prudacts and know more about whats the new inventions.
     But in addition to the big companies and there own prudacts which its usfull.They have to work hard to let us know more about there prudacts by advertising about it on TV or at any other way where we can look after and give it a big part of attention where it needs, for me, i'd love to read or see any commercial adversting about  computers and what is the new invintions wither i need it or i dont.

303,0,"It would be universally acknowledged that young people enjoy life more than older people do. According to me, this statement can not be entirely true. Let us consider my personal view and the comparison between a young people life and an older person life.

For the great majority of people, youngness brings all that a person want: health, beauty, love and so on. And it is wright. But something everybody ignores, is the notion of time. In our society who has time to do what they want? Currently, young people are the most of the time students. They have a lot of work to pass their exams and have their dilpoma. By this way, they study a lot and spend their time working at home or on campus.  added to this question of time, a student has no money. Studies are very expensives, above all in the United-States. A master could cost 20 000 euros for a year. It would be difficult to have extraordinary week-ends or travel to a foreign country or to do a very expensive sport. All these things bring us to consider diferently a young people life. With no time and no money, how could a student really enjoy is life?

On the other hand, older people do not have all the daily life problems'. Of course, they have some healthy problems but they have time because they are retired. They worked all their life, they accumulated money.  They can travel all over the world and make their dream possible. They don't have children at home, they don't have a lot of preocupation. They can live their life as they want, see their friends when they want. According to me, older people could  enjoy life a lot. 

This brief presentation can lead us to reconsiderate the statement. Young people are to busy to lead their life as they want. Old people have this opportunity. It is important to realize this. It is my personal opinion."
5258,0,"I disagree with the prior statement for several reasons. When we say that is is better to do this or that, we should ask ourselves: better for whom? Is it better for me, for the others, for society as a whole? I think that altough a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can be fruitful for individuals, societies rely more and more on specialized knowledge. And this is why i disagree with the statement. 
The first  argument is that if a society values knowledge, and ours does, then it should realize that the pursuit of knowledge is fostered by intense research in areas that become by necessity the object of further and further specialization. To increase our knowledge about things, be it nature, or the social realm, or just abstract math, we need researchers to constantly go beyond what they already know. It is only by being at the forefront of a given discipline that we can gain more knowledge about it. 
The second argument in support of specialized knowledge is that we, as a society - even though there are relevant exceptions-, do not pursue knowledge only for knowledge's sake. We use knowledge in order to satisfy an objective, be it the improvement of our societies, or of our health, or whatever it is we want to improve. Doctors want to heal people, engineers want to build bridges. Most of our society's needs depend on specialized knowledge. Broad knowledge of many subjects can serve the spirit, but the well-being of modern societies requires more than well-educated, well-rounded citizens.
Last but not least, our societies, which we value, as we have already said, need to be sustainable in the long term. Sustainability -economic, social, ecological- is a complex issue and we as a society need to educate people that should be able to treat this complex phenomena.
These are some of the reasons why we can say that specialized knowledge is better for our societies and therefore that is is better to have this kind of knowledge than having broad knowledge of many subjects. That said, individuals should be interested in areas in which they are not specialized, because thirst of knowledge is part of being human and it makes our societies richer in variety and more interesting."
11104,0,"Traveling another country always gave us enthusiastism. When I was young, my mom and dad sometomes fought because of going trip with a group led by people or going by our selves. Whenever we have a plan to travel, although we have significant ideas, we usally had the trouble. Both of them give us convenience things, However each of them gives us good things and bad things. The way to travel with a group led by a tour guide sometimes provide convenience. The guide is guide us famous and popular places. Also we do not have to make a plan for trip, and there is no percentage for losing roads. However I belive that going travel without a group led by a tour guide is more effective.
  Going travel without a group led by a tour guide offer a new and different kind of experience to traveler. We can try to find anywhere we want to visit. Even if we lose our roads or the ways to go, as finding the right way, that is going to be unforgettable memories and experiences. 
  It is the travel for our enjoy and rest. However, if we go with a group, it could be very uncomfortable travel. We always need to think of them and watch out for them. there might be a scehdule that we do not want to. We cannot do whatever we want to either cannot go whatever we want to go.
  The last of all, we can save our money for traveling. There is some package for traveling in a kind of flight company. That is their job and they need money. It means it's cost is higher than traveling by ourselves. We can waste our money, even our times!
  According to those reasons, I prefer traveling without a group led by a tour guide. Also I hope everytime I travel, I want to have much fun, at the same time I want to save my money."
2351,0,"It will be unfair to be on either side of this statement, as both are good in their own context and usage. But, in order to take one option, I will go with having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than specializing in one specific subject.

As, we are living in a fast paced world where information is passed at high rate and we are rapidly becoming a residant of a global village. I am sure that a person with just a specialized know how of creating new toys for children will not be able to go far if he don't posses good marketing skills too or a comapny like TOYATA would have not been so succesfull if it had not able to match its supply and demand, ofcourse simeltaneously. For another example even in one of the most specialized occupation, military it is essential even for a good and  strong soldier to diversify himself and have a proper knowledge of his location with respect to his enemy which he can get with the help of new technologies like GPRS with a primary knowledge to fight and survive, its all about survival of the fittest.

It is also very risky for any individual to keep specializing in one field without knowing the scope and growth of that particular field. It is after all the question of surviving in this highly competitve world. Even to understand our own interests and strengths before specializing in any particular subject we need to diversify us into various academic or real life experiences and sometimes by even failing in few ventures where we are not strong.

So instead of keeping all my eggs in one basket I would rather go for various baskets before making the choice for the perfect one. I would rather understand various academic subjects and will be in a position to effeciently corelate them and that will be more fruitful than specializing in one field."
9869,0,"I would like to start by stating that I fully agree with the statement that ""Most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are.""  I will present three arguments that support my opinion.

Firstly I would like to explain that a good advertisement always has the best picture taken of the item marketed.  For example,  when you go to the fast food restaurant you usally rely on pictures to decide what you are going to eat.  The nice pictures tempt your appetite and make you salivate.  But when you actully receive the end product, like a MacDonald's Hamburger, it never looks as nicely constructed as the picture showed it would be.  A nice picture can speek a million words.

My second argument is that most advertisements are performed by very good looking individuals or endorsed by someone famous.  To utilize such powerfull individuals will influence what you think of the item advertized.  For example, if Jessica Simpson says that the leading acnee medication is Proactive and that she uses it herself, then it must mean that it is an exeptional product because she is very rich and famous and can decide to use any product she wants. 
We trust the people we look up to or wish we could be.

My last argument is that a good advertisment and brilliant marketing will undoubtebly bias our own personal experience.  Who can actually tell which product is a brand name if it has no label on it.  If I were to blindfold you and have you taste 10 different macaroni and cheese could you pick out which one is the real Kraft Dinner?

An advertisement is very brilliantly constructed to attract consumers.  I truly believe that we are all influenced, at some level, by cleaver advertisement and that we can all admit that we have been suckered into the latest gimmic at some point.  We might not admit it to others though!"
7659,0,"I am completely positive about the statement. Here i would like to mention some reasons why a group travel is the best way to travel. I work for a travel company as a tour guide, so i guess i confirm advantages of group travelling.
  First of all, tourists feel secure when they are travelling with plenty of people and their guide, who is a local resident of the site. Group travelling people can defend themselves in time difficult times and it is more likely to acttract public attention for requesting for help. In some places, it is suggested to tourists not to go out alone because of high velocity rate. 
  Second reason why i prefer group travel is payment for the travel cost. Needless to say, it is noticably cheaper than single travel for certain countries. Even a number of tour companies offer special programmes for group tourists, not only discounts, but also free-of-charge trips for group leaders or certain amount of members.   The third reason serves our company's main goal, More people, more fun. It is much interesting to travel with many different people in order to have a real vacation. Group tourists can attend different competitions, matches and other attractive entertainment. 
  Travelling is not only the meaning of to travel, but to make friends and to get relationship with them. It offers people more chances to make friends in an easier way. I know of many occasions that tourists get marry after a long, exciting tour. 
  in conclusion, i have a strong point of view of travelling as a group. Tourists feel more secure, more respect and guides feel more responsibility when they are travelling as a group."
410,0,"Some people may think knowing the facts is more important than knowing the ideas and concepts.  Some people may think in different way.  What I suggest is that let student to understand ideas and concepts it is more important for students only to learn the facts.
	Refer to the subjects i had study in high school, some of them i can not remember it clearly, some of them i still have the class picture in my mind.  The different between these subujects is the subject i still have picture in my mind is what i had interest in.  When people learning something having a interest in it is more effective than having a good teacher in the class.  It is not because teacher is not important but because if someone have the interest in something this will help this person learn better.
	To understand the ideas could help the students to understand the subject more.  Like learning the language if someone have that language background already, it will help that person learn more effective.  knowing something's working the idea like the background that person have.
	Knowing the concepts likes a person has some experiences before him to study something.  Everybody knows have experiences before then to start something could help that person to really understant the subject alot than the first time.  It is as same as someone had study a subject before, this personwill has more chance to earn a  better mark.  Therefore, knowing the concepts can not be ingored.   It is the basic step to get upper level.
	In my opinion, It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than only for them to know the facts.  Usually for students facts are boring, like the meat other person had eaten before, students can not learn much about it.  However, ideas and concepts like the fresh meat it is health and student will got a much interest in it."
5156,0,"There are so many subjects which entices our concerning during study in university. It is not a matter you're bachelor or master or doctor. The real essentical of academic subject, knowledge itself, is interesting and attracting for human. But, I don't agree with the assetion that we must boraden our knowledge better than specialize in on specific subjec. I will give you a two reasons. 

 First, there is no such easy academic subject which can conquer in one or two decade. Almost every academic subject needs one's whole life's efforts. Most important thing to become a intellecture is concenturation in one specific subject not become a know-everything man. Actually, human can not kwow whole things of the world. For example, there is a person who I know. He studies philosophy and he also eager to know lot of things about the non-philosophical things. It is not a bad attutude I think. But, He didn't get the degree in year what he plans to get that because of that eager distracted his concenturation. 
 
 Second, the society wants the person who has knowledge which is specialized in one specific subject.  If he knows lot of other knowledge,  of course it is a good things. But it is not a primary but secondary. People who are talent in one specific subject can works as proffessional. But the person who know many things but not specialized is not a proffessional. For example, there was two friends of mine. the one of them was talented in many things. he was a good singer and good dancer. He also studed well but not the best. When he became a adult, he get a job. But it was not a specialized job. The another friends was talented in only school study. But when he became adult, he got a job in a specialized area and he got a lot of salery. 

 To sum up, very essential respect of academic knowledge doesn't allow multi-studying. Because the ability of human is so limited, We must concentrate in one study. And The society need proffesional person not a know-everthing man."
1096,0,"In this period,it's very important to try to do new things or new jobs because with the development of innovation there are less opportunities to become a successful person,and as a result only if you take some risks you will obtain some good results.
A good example of this theory is Bill Gates, that has used the innovation to become the most important person in all the world and now he can do everything he wants.As far as I'm concerned,I'd like to have an idea like Bill Gates,because I'm sure that this idea could be a solution to all my economic problems!!
But I also believe that if you do what you know how to do well,you can have a normal and nice life, with some good aspects but also with some problems,instead if you want to become a successful man, the only thing that you can do is to try an original job or a new trend, because in this era only if you are a creative person you can found success and easy money.For instance, my father has done the same job for thirty years,and he has a very normal life,he helps me with the University's taxes and he has lot of friends,but he's too far to be a successful man.
In spite of it's very difficult to be considered a successful person, there are lots of successful man in all the world,so I think that it's not impossibe to become an important man, but it's sure that if you don't look for a new idea, you can't be considered  like this one,so in conclusion I'm agree with the statement."
391,0,"In my point of view, I agree with that most advertisings or commercial messeges make products look much better than they really are.   There are three reasons of my opinion.
       First, all of company advertise their product to sell as much as they can, so they try to show their product much better than they really are.  They even spend their cost for advertising tremendously, and in these days, many of companies consider how to make the best advertisements or commercial messege and hire some specialists for that.  For instance, one of the big companies in country, Toyota usually estimates its cost for advertising approximately 20~30% of their budget annualy.  I assume that others also spend the budget for that.
       Second, the companies usually try to make their image better and advertising is the primary stragedy for that.  In my country, images of companies, industries, and productions depend on what sort of advertisement and commercial messege they do and how they make the consumers impress about them.  In my country, about 10 years ago a small venture company got bankruptsy because of the commercial messege and it was brought to the court.  The judge ruled that the image was part of sexial harrassment.  I think this is rare example, but that is the advertising.
       Finally, the advertising companies are also doing their business.  in my country, I think it is the same as in the United States, the competition between the advertising companies are also hard and they try to make the best commercial they can.  So, their motivation is also very high.  In Asia, there is a big competition of commercial messege and they decide the best commercial in every year.  
       In conclusion, I cannot say this is good because we are confused because of the advertisement and we just buy something, even if it is not good.  All we should do is just look anything carefully when we buy something."
7090,0,"I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.

The first reason why I agree with this statement is that young people have changed. In old days in Korea, young people were very helpful. They helped to build houses and fix things, which are dangerous and hard. This works were for young people and they did it without hesitation. However, these days young people do not care about their communities. Young people, nowadays, have different attitudes. 

Another reason that I think is that young people are not connected with communities. In Korea, young people, who assume as students, are very busy studying. They go school at 7 in the morning and come back in the mid-night. They have no time to participate for their communities. Whereas, in old days in Korea, there were more people who were not  student and also school works were not hard.

Last but not least, some young people wants to help their communities. For example, helping and taking care of elderly people or children. However, I am not sure about other countries, but in Korea, parents usually do not want their children, who are students, to help for their communities. The reason is  obvious that they want their children to study for their future university rather than caring about their communities. 

Taking into account of all factors, people are becoming more egoistic, not only young people, but also their parents and adults. Anyhow, we may reach the conclusion that the statement is correct."
8143,0,"Nowadays most fortunate human beings have access to an endless amount of data through many ways: internet, books, ... This gives them a wide knowledge on how to use ideas and concepts when learning facts implies knowledge without understanding. On one hand we'll deal with the advantages and disadvantages of learning facts and on the other hand with those of understanding ideas and concepts.

Mankind has evolved a lot and research followed. Through the centuries humans discovered so many things that a lot of them are even inaccessible for most of us today. When dealing with how human body works we can't even see half of what makes us but thanks to new technologies some people can see microbes, viruses and understand how they create our mood, diseases or else. Most of us couldn't even verify most of this explanations but good thing is we can learn them and use them in many fields so that we're not bound to what we can see or understand simply.

While learning gives us many informations on some things, understanding ideas and concepts is more likely to help us in our lives. As a matter of fact, neither knowing that cellulas split nor that 2+2=4 can guide us while having to resolve a situation. If people learn ideas and concepts they can apply them in many ways afterwards in everyday life. Moreover, this can lead to new thoughts and new approaches on some subjects like religion while learning facts is a  way of narrowing human thinking and bounding knowledge to what we can learn without thinking.

To conclude, I would rather understand few main concepts and ideas of life that I could use in many situations than learning thousands of interesting things that I could never understand."
717,0,"As people grow older their interests may change. Whether young or old, each generation has each ammusement. However I  think that young people enjoy life more than older people do for three reasons.
 First of all, generally speaking, young people have less careful to their health than old people do. As people grow older the possibility that they become sick would become increase. In hospital there are too many older people who consult in doctor for many reasons. As opposed to that, young people can eat everything they like and go everywhere. Health is the most dearest thing of all.
 Second of all, young people has not their lives fixed completely and can change their career or plan of the future easily. Old people cannnot never change their job or their partner of marriage. It makes the life of old people boring and less exciting. In addition to that old people have heavy responsibility for their job and their family. In contrast, young people have much time in the future; they can  draw their dream as they want and can do their best in order to realize their dream.
 Finally young people, perticularly young women can enjoy fasion and cosmetics. In the department store the most part of the fashion floor is occupied by the clothes shops for young women. This means that young people tend to enjoy  fahionable life and fashion brands target not old woman but young woman. Young woman can spend more many fashion that old woman do because young woman can use their many freely. And as people get older they get their weight more easily that they were young and they cannnot wear the closethes that were fit to them when they were young.
 Young people enjoy their life tma"
6832,0,"Having knowledge is always good. Knowledge gives us culture and also shows us different points of view about things.
I think it is better to know about many subjects than just know about one in particular.
People live in a society and interact with other people. In my opinion, the only way to understand people is to know about them  . When you have the knowledge about a variety of subjects, you have a wider mind and it is easier to understand people's behavior in almost any situation.
If you are a doctor, for example, you need to know about your patients' behavior. You need to talk to them when they are in pain. It is easier for you if you have studied psichology, for instance.So, it is better if you have knowledge not just in medicine.
Knowledge about different subjects gives us culture and can be helpul in some cases. It allows us to know about art, literature, and many other subjects that are important for our character.If we study art and literature, we can be more creatives. If we study technology, we can repair some appliances at home.It is practical to know about different subjects.
In my opinion, the more we know, the more complete person we are.
If we have time, it is better to study different subjects than just one.
In this way we can easily interact with the people, we can be more creative and, at the same time it can be usefuf for our daily activities.
As a conclusion, we are learning everyday about different subjects. It is good to do it for our own good."
590,0,"I agree with this statement because in my opinion a successful people have more money to spend than normal people.
They can try what they want, and in their opinion anything is forbbiden .
They want to try always new experiences, know new things and sometimes take risks.
Last week I have read to the newspaper that a famous Italian singer decided to spent a month in a unknow place (probabily an island).
He wants to stay alone. None can go with him. He has not a personal phone because in this place the phone do not work in this way he can not communicate. He want to stay in contact with the nature. For find food he can only fishing or hanting.
In my opinion it was a very dangerous experince but I think that the only reason that this singer decide to go is to increase in success.
If he does not the economic possibility I am sure that he do not go.

I think that is important to increase your knowledges, try news things but there are some limits that we must respect.
It is good to do small things but well than more things not well.
I think that a dream that the man have is to fly, but for natural conditions it can not possible."
6854,0,"I agree with the statement, mainly because I think  that it is imperative for students to understand ideas and concepts and knowing  how to act upon them is more important than just knowing facts.
	From my experience in highschool, I think students in general find it much easier to just learn facts rather than understanding concepts and ideas. One simple example is when I used to love ""labelling the heart diagram"" in biology class but just despise explaning Newton's First principle law of motion in physics class. On the contrary when there is a written response question on a test it would be much easier for students to respond when they actually understand what they are talking about rather than just knowing the fact. 
 Another broader example is when we had to make a student commitee with the job of spreding out the word in school of aiding with recycling and cleaning up. Many of us did it but I highly doubt that everyone understood why they where doing. 
	So in the end I believe for a student to get through his life experience as being a student with a degree of some sort, he has to understand idaes and concepts and act upon them ."
11787,0,"Since its very early emergence, conception and ethical side of the advirtesement has been harshly criticized both by the intellectuals and common people. It is true that  we all live in the era of globalization and capitalism of which the advirtesement constitutes 'the bread and butter'. However,  there are still significant opinions claiming for existence of certain game rules which will prevent adviretesements to make products seem much better than they really are.
First, the ever-growing high competition in almost every market leads advertisements to develop such tactics. Given the high density of competitors supplying,  to some degree, similar products in the market, embodying some fictional qualities to one of them is a lot cheaper than improving it. 
For instance, taking a bigger, tastier or more delightful picture of an Arby's or Burger King hamburger (most of these pictures are competely fictional) is rather easy and useful to take a better competitive position in the fast food market. It probably leads us to go and buy one of these burgers and this is the point when the responsibility of advirtesements ends.  
To solve this problem of false representation of the products in market, it is necessary to have some sort of governmental interventions and regulations. For the sake of both consumers' and competitor firms' rights, ministry of economic affairs in any given country should have the right and duty of controlling the advirtesement market accordingly. As long as we do not have such instruments, fictional products are going to stay \on our billboards."
7627,0,"Today, many advertisements are making much products. And they are making profits more than what they suppose to have. And there is couple reason for it.
	First reason is, most advertisements has some kinds of bubble. The bubble what am I talking about is, the bubble which make advertisements look more fency and more valuable. For example, they are entertaining themselves so they can show their appearance to people so they can make people think those advertisements are really good and support those advertisements. Another example is, they are using the commer show. Many people are spending time for watch the commer shows when they are watcing the television. And most advertisements are using commer show and entertaintment. So,  most advertisements can make products seem much better than they really are.
	Second, they are helping each other and make more profits by information or some of helping. And they are entertaining each other to the other people who do not know about those advertisements really much. So they got more people and they get more profit and products more than what they suppose to have.
	Many advertisements are making products much better than what they suppose to make. However, I think it is one of the skill for them. And advertisements are one of member for cycle of economy. So, I think those are not that bad except some of the other things that so many bubbles."
8110,0,"I do not agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.There are many disadvantages to follow the tour guide.Even getting a tour guide can be harmful and dangerous for tourists.
  First of all,when you follow the tour guide to see around the city which you want to see and travel,you only can see places in which the tour guide shows you and your group.You can not find out around of city.Everytime there are some limitations which are made by the tour guide.For example,you want to see other side of city,but there is a certain travel program which includes to see certain place in the city.You have to follow the travel program.
 Second of all,People who are from that city can understand that you are tourist.This sutation has some dangeours point.They can cheat on you or sell kind of present things to you much more expensive.For example,when you go to a store  for shopping,if they understand that you are a foreigner or a tourist they can try to sell many things much more expensive,but if you travel alone and you can speak the language of that country which you want to see they can not understand that you are a foreigner or a tourist.So people who are from that country or that city can sell things to you in original price.
  Third of all,is traveling with groups not expensive activity but  also it is a so dangerous.There are many terrorits people or groups who want to kidnapp to tourists and foreigner people to come true  their  bad purposes.Those kind of people can realize that you are a tourist,because you are travelling with the group and following the tour guide.They can kidnapp you and kill you.Furthermore they can use you for their purposes.That situtaion happenned the tourists many times.Those people killed the tourist or got money from the tourist of family.
  In above,there are many advantages about traveling alone and following the tour guide.The quite proverb says that "" It does not matter whatever travelling alone and following tour guide cost,people can listen their heart and  make their ways for travelling.""That's why we have to travel alone."
6571,0,"I do not agree with the topic that  ""It is better to specialize in one subject only"" because in the present computerized world people are expected to do many things at a time.a broader knowledge of many academic subjects will give the person to make himself with any type of environment.The world  is not isolated  every company have different jobs to do.I mean every company is dealing with many activities and expecting people to have the basic skills to perform reasonably good in every activity.
                                                 
                                                  For example take a company say IBM one of the biggest company in the world.There are many branches in the say Hardware,Software and so on.Many times People from one branch are shifted to other branch depending on the work and he is expected to do well in that branch also.Without having the basic skills in other academics he cannot perform in that branch.
                                 
                                                   But for a department like Research this may not sound good there people are expected to invent something new for the future use of society.In this case the person is expected to focus more on which he is doing research.Even then he need some basic skills in other academics.For example if a person is doing research in VLSI designing,along with Electronics he has to be familiar with Electrical technology,Embeded systems,Computer sciences.This is because every academic subject is  related to other academic subjects.No subject is isolated from the other academic subjects.
               
                                                     From the above points discussed i would like to summarize my topic that it would be better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.Broader the knowledge , broader will be the choice and a better future."
10358,0,"I disagree .

	In twenty years there will be more cares than there are today. In addition, cars indusries and manufacters are widerange all over the world. Therefor, future wise number of cars will increase in the coming years as well as the needs of the cars.
  
	First of all, now adays using a car as a way of transportation is world wide. Eventhough there are other ways, car still concider the major use of transportation . Moreover, Population of people is increasing thats why the need for more cars will apply.

	Secondly, 








	All in all ,"
311,0,"In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today and I am strongly agreeing on that statement. Currently the world is changing in extremly fast speed than what we expect. Especially technology is the part where humans are really concentrating on and that will bring lot of influence to the future car. Also environmental problem will give influence to stop making car.
	According to the news article, the world gasoline will run out in next 10 years. If there aren't any gasoline left in the world then the car won't move. Currently most of the cars are moving with gasoline and it is in serious problem. Lot of car companies are feeling this is serious problem, and they decided to make hybrid car. Instead of making new designed-car they thought making hybrid car will be more efficient car in the future. Instead of gasoline, they will use alternative energy such as crude palm oil or the sunlight. Next twenty years will come really fast and probably they can't produce lot of hybrid cars so numbers of cars  in next twenty years will be fewer than now.
	Second lot of environmental issues had been brought by cars and that will reduce the number of cars in the future. At present, due to air pollution, the global warming is happening. The ozone layer has the huge hole due to air pollution. The main reason can be CO2 which is coming out from the car. To save the world, lot of country will reduce the number of cars to stop global warming. Anyway as I mentioned in above information, the car won't go because there won't be any gasolines left so cars which is running with gas will goto junk yards or developed into other tool machines.
	With two above evidences, in next twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. Due to cars which are running with gasolines are causing lot of problem to the world and that will reduce the number of cars in the future."
10085,0,"Although I can understand why some peolpe have the impression that young people today are not engaging themselves enough to helping their communities, I disagree with this statement. I have three reasons for my opinion.
First, in my view, young people have to dedicate most of their time to their education and career. As the unemployment rate in most countries increases year after year this is the only way for young people to asure themselves a job in the future. For example, young people have to attend college or university, they have classes during the day and usually homework to do in the evening. Some students also have to work part-time to be able to afford the university fees.
Second, a lot of young people are planing their own family when they are still young. When you have children on your own you need time to raise them. Children need a lot of attention as they always have so many questions about the world and a lot of reasearch papers state that the intellectual capabilities of children are influenced most at a very young age. So parents should take all the time they need to raise their children and explain everything to them.
Finally, I am convinced that even though young people do not have a lot of free time, still many of them do engage themselves to helping their communities. I would like to give two examples of the community I live in. In our community especially young people are part of the First Aid Team of the local Red Cross. They spend their time doing different volunteer services, like medical help or entertainement for older people. Furthermore, the Fire Department of our town has a special youth organization for people aged below 17 years. For the last five years the volunteer members of this youth organization have increased steadily.
Concluding, I think that young people today have a lot of important activities and obligations like their own education or the founding of their own family which prevent them from giving more time to helping their communities. But I also have the impression that young people still engage in their free time as much as they can to improve their communities' conditions."
11575,0,"Nowadays we see many advertisements everywhere,on television or in newspapers,on radio or in all streets of our cities;furthermore the advertisements business is always bigger and this is the reason for the importance of spot.
I think that a lot of products shown in advertisements are worse than they appear. In my opinion there is one mainly reason for this situation.
First of all the purpose of advertisments is to get people to buy the product, so producters try to show us that their things are the better on trade. 
There are many ways to make products much better than they really are.Thanks to tecnhology we can make many changes on a photo or on a imagine in order to show it better, and all of advertisements are made in this way. 
In addiction we see many advertisements in which the products aren't in their natual ""habitat""; we must think about water spot: the bottle is always near a river or at the top of an high mountain to make water seems pure and genuine.  I remember a motorcycle spot in which a man with his scooter followed a militar airplane in order to convey much power to the motorcycle...have you never seen a scooter that can follow an airplane? 
In our society we give much importance to movement; according to this situation many advertisements are much movimented; i think about a machine that trasforms himself in a monster and dance exactly like humans.
In conclusion i think that most advertisements are worse than they appear because of business scope."
6168,0,"I agree with the statement that says that ""In twenty years there will be fewer cars than there today"".
In fact I have to admit, for my personal experience, that in the last ten years this was the tendence we are achieving, even if it is not a good result.
I think that in twenty years there are going to be fewer cars because of several reasons.
First of all the cities are getting bigger. I have read last week that most of the people now live in cities. That means that they are going to have to move inside the city, and as bigger the city becomes, as more people will need to have a car (unless the State will offer the possibility to move with an alternative transport).
Secondly cities are often overcrowded, and people who do not have much money are obliged to find another place where to live out of the city. This means once again that they are going to need a car to get to the city for working, for example. Also there are people that dislike the style of life that often a city offers. They would probably try to find a place where to live that is out of the city, but from where they are able to get to the city by car.
Morover I think it also depends on how the State, or the local community would act. There are several examples that demonstrate that when a local community do not want to have too many cars in the city, some solutions can be found to resolve this problem.
The first thing is to make a good city plan, that can really help. If a city is planned in a smart way that considers different things, as where to put major roads, or how to plan alternative transports, then to move in the city is definitely easier.
Secondly the State should try to sensibilize more and more people that live in the city, who often do not care about this topic because they are more comfortable by moving with their own car or because they think this problem does not affect them. Which is not true, because they do not feel comfortable at all while trying not to get stuck in line or when air pollution reaches really dangerous limits!
Finally I agree with the statement, even if I think that it will be a huge problem if this actually comes true."

 had learned any fact it will not stored in his memory and he cannot remember it so long time.
                          If student had concept he can explain the related concept anywhere at anytime.the ideas and concept generated by the student will be remembered as much as long time than the learned fact.If student builts a concept on related matter on his own ideas it will be very useful for him future.student builted topic is related to his job then it will play a major role of life and he can settled in his life and knowledge about related topic will be improve his efficiency in his job also.Due to this the student can well score or remember about that topic.
                                  But where as in learned facts the student can remember much time about the topic.The student who based on the leaned fact has book knowledge or theory knowledge.Theory knowledge will not will stored in the memory for so much time.Here i want to say my opinion, that is practical knowledge is much more better than theory knowledge.By learning the  topic it cant remembered so much time and it is very useful only for those students in exam point of view.The practical knowledge is well remembered and it can explained to his junior students also where as theory knowledge cannot remembered by the persom after the exam is completed.
                     For example let us take mathmatics subject.In this
 subject  the whole matter is based on problems only.Here only some formulas can remembered by the person or student.the problem should be solved on basis of that formula related one.If the student will learned the problem it cannot remember by that him so long time.If he built the ideas on the problem he can remember the problem for long time.Here in this subject it is improved that practical knowledge or concept of students are well efficiect than theory or learned knowledge.
                    In my opinion concept is better than the theory or learned knowledge."
8106,0,"I disagree this statement. Although we do not need to consider about the schedule, we may loose the chance to talk with poeple who live in the tour place. I think it is one of the interesting incidents we have some opprtunities to talk with such as people.
Recently, There are a number of tours which is planed by tour companies. Most of these tour is led by tour guide. Parhaps, we have to go the places where we do not want to go, because the other members want to go.I think one of the reasons we go to travel is to separate from our own society. Sometime we want to escape from the societies which we belong to. However, if we go to a tour led by a tour guide, we may travel with the other poeple who applyed  the same tour. In this situation, we have to construct new society while we travel. If we could not get along with the other poeple who take part in the same tour, we might be tired, in conparison.
In addition, the one of the interest thing about travel is planning the tour course, in advance. I think  travel  starts when we decided to go. No matter how tour guide construct the  tour which is suitable for us, we become to loose one of the intrest thing of trip.
For these reasons, we should travel by ourself rather than led by a tour guide. I would like to fun the quality of tour from planning, when we start, where we go, how we go and with who we go."
543,0,"In twenty yers we will live in a different world in which we will have completly avoided pollution by wasting less natural resources as possible.
In my opinion, we have already experimented successfully the methods to reach this aim consuming everyday less oil and using more bicycles and pubblic transports.As a matter of fact the cost of the bus ticket is going down because people is starting again to consider this way of transport as a  valid alternative to his own car and as an easiest possibility to save money ( nowadays, the cost of oil is growing too much and,on average,only 2 persons per 5 are  available to spend a lot of money for it ) and to avoid to be stuck in the traffic of  the city center.
But refusing to drive cars and choose to go to work by foot or to reach university by bicycles is also a good motivation to keep in haelth and to do an everyday-life gym without spending any money which can help us to mantain younger and good-looking as long as possible in order to teach our children or grand children to respect nature and to improve our physical attitude simply by using an alternative transport to cars.
In fact,cars (as we are used to think of them) are doomed to be fewer because we will improve the prototype for different way to give locomotion to them.
Recent studies have asserted that is possible to make cars working by involving hydrogene insted of oil and it could pollute and cost ever less than a traditional car.
So, I am sure that cars in twenty years will disappear and we will be able to support the missing of alternative transports better because technology is working to give us the best of itself in order to improve the quality of our life."
9655,0,"It is a controversal issue that which is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts or to learn facts. Some people say that students learn facts because it's easy to memorize about something. But in my opinion, students have to learn ideas and concepts about something because of two reasons.

       First of all, learning ideas and concepts are a basic way to understand everything. If they just memorise facts about something, for example, maybe at that time they think they know everything. But after that if they met some problem that are simmiller with something that they just learned, they will not be able solve the proble because they just learned not basic ideas and concepts but the fact about something. which means they don't know how to solve the problem and how to think to find the way.

       Second, if students learn ideas and concepts about something, it makes students can more creative than that they just learn facts. For instance, if students learn about a car and understant ideas or concepts about how to move the car, after then they can expect that how to move a truck or bus. Also, they will think about other transportation like a train or subway and think about their work. Maybe these thinking ways make students more creatively.

       In conclusion, because of reaons that I above mentioned, students have to understand ideas and concepts when they learn about something. It is a best way to understand and also it helps students think about everyting creatively."
3569,0,"I disagree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in twenty years than there are now. 

First of all there was no considerable change in the last twenty years and I think there will not be one in the next twenty. Although there have been going on  some developments that speak for the use of public transport, such as the increasing oil price or the ongoing improvments in public transport, the reasons why people use cars or refuse to take public vehicles will stay the same over the next twenty years.

I think the first and most important reason why a lot of people will not give up their cars is the flexibility it brings. You do not have to care about bus schedules. If you want to go somewhere you simply enter your car and immediately you are on your way.

A further, also very important reason is the independency a car brings. You do not have to worry about how to come to the next train station or what to do if you need to go somewhere in the middle of the night when no public transport is active. Neither you have to care about being late for work as the train is late. You only depent on yourself.

Another fact that supports my theory is that the prices for public transport are still quite expensive. Considering that they have not changes considerably in the last twenty years I do not expect them to get much cheaper in the next twenty years.

Furthermore cars and their efficency are improved continuously, which makes them more and more independent from the oil price.

I think that all the mentioned reasons contribute their part to the theory that in twenty years there will be as many cars in use  as there are today."
10650,0,"Cars are  transportation that is useful for life.In thirthy years before nearly there is no car used but it become more comman then espically nowadays there is a car nearly in a family.Because cars are used for many reasons but maybe in twenty years cars are used fewer than today there is some reasons for this stiuation.
           First of all, cars will leave its place to another transportations like plane,ship,bicycle and etc. Maybe people go everywhere by plane or ship it is much more comfortable and taking less time than cars.In adittion to his people can not tired because they will not use car everything will ready for them they only will buy tickets and take rest for them.In this way people will trip a lot they will get accusttem this and want it nearly a month.So  the  cars will be teking their place to another transportations.
            The other reasons for leave up cars is that cars are taking of pollution to the environment.And Cars are caused  a lot of traffic jam the reasons for taking car will usefull gor everything.In contrast to cars uses it gives a lot of damages to the other parts of life.
             In conclusion, cars are maybe  more comman now but  I agree that it will be restricted within twenty years.So it will be so"
1943,0,"how many cars there will be in the future?
it's impossible to know, but we could think about different ipotetic solutions.
for example if the petroil will be less in the future probably an effective reduction of cars could be there in the next twenty years. but maybe a new scientific solutions will be find, and a new engine like oxigen or hydrogen could be emply for replace the petroil.

in my opinion i think cars will not decrease in the future. why ? it is very simple, every year there is an esponential growth of people in the world. what does this means? only one thing, more people more cars. i think at this time, every family has one cars for each familiy's members more or less. 
for example my family is composed by 4 person, me, my brother and my parents. me with my mother drive the same car, my father has two cars, my father's company gives him one, the second car he buys for sparetime. my brother has a car and also a motocycle. at the end there are 4 cars in my family how we are.
how i could think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use there are today? it's impossible.

the only solution, it is enlarge the public communication system, for example put in the city's roads more bus or tram than now, or increase the railways services, built underground system in the big city.
to support this solution is necessary also an other factors: make cheaper than now the public services. until now if i use my car is cheaper than buy a railway ticket. every year the ticket is more expensive. why does it happens? the governement shoul make easier to use public service not harder, also for a different reason: decrease the pollution of environement, use in the best way the nature's energies and doesn't waste them because very soon can be ended. 

for all of these reasons, i think is necessary a large dose of good intention to make possible the statement: fewer cars in the future.

5216,0,"in today's world, more and more people find success during their lives, however, several causes could make the success of this person. it might be the abundance of money, the personal instincs or also, the fact that are constantly creating and trying new things. because i am the kind of person who takes a lot of risks, i strongly agree with the statement which said that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.

	first of all, in my opinion, success is depend on the capacity of inventing and creating new things either materials or immaterials things. sometimes it is a brand new idea, another time it is a brand new item, and the other times, it is  just a way to act. but in all this case, the thing that is created has never ever been before. although it is not the only reasons that lead people to success, it is one of the main points. in addition to the creativity of the person, several factors could entered in count. one other means to sucess is the fact to taking much more risks than a common person. in fact, the person who want to try new things and to improve the way he lives has a lot more chance to succeed than the person who just does what she knows exactly. as an example of that, i could speak about the difference between a machine and a human being that are doing the same movement all day long. the machine always does the same act, and does not try to figure out ohow it is possible to do it better, whereas the human being try to increase his ability to do this act. in this way, he try new thing and takes risks to improve his way to act. he is more successful than the machine. for me, those characteristics are the main one that make me do agree with the statement written in the introduction.

	for instance, my godfather is one of the person who reflects completely the fact that success should be in accord to the risks and trying new things. since at least a quarter of century, he works for an engineering company. he is in the creativitypool. he started as a common computer engineer, and now he his the head manager of a team of 45 people. he started just with his willingness, and among a lot more other qualities, he started with his own ideas. during his work, he talked about that with his collegue. those latter made him increase his level inside the society because the majority of his own ideas were right, and efficient for the firm. that is why, they all agreed with him. now, he is on the way for the retirement, but, however, he is the proof that successful people had better to count on there own creativity instead of counting on the out factors, and also, doing all the time, the thing that they know how to do perfectly. no imajination is equal to boringness. creativity seems to say modernity, improvment, originallity... success

	despite the fact that there is a lot of causes to explain a successful person, as far as i am concerned, i strongly think that a person who is taking risks and trying new things is more able to find sucess during his whole life than a person who jsut act as he is supposed to. finally, otherwise, success required taking risks."
5397,0,"It is hard to identy the one way in this dillema having broad knowledge about many academic subjects than to specializa in one specific subject.  According to me,  to spealize in one specific subject provide so much detail in one subject, creates experts in specific subjects and increase concentration on the issue, make team spretual, so the new achievements can be achieved easily. 
First of all to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects make the one skip the details. Therefore they can never have deep knowledge about the one main subject. On the other hand, in the one will speliaze in one subject to do not skip the details, since it has so many time to focus on the subject. 
Secondly, if the one try to know everything, acn not be expert of one subject. If the specific subject is specialized than, and make deep investigation about the area s/he will be known as the expert on the issue. Then after, I can call specialized as experts
In addition to those if the one has broad knowlege of everything, s/he would not except the team work, since s/he can see himself as the one knows everything. Fourtunately, the expert would want to get the others aspects about the project and can create the effective team work and brain storming in order to achieve the result of his or her project. That means getting information from other specialists.
At last the expert can achive the result of the projects more easliy, since s/he would only concentrate what they should do. If the help is needed than they can get help from other experts. Therefore it would maximaze the efficeny of knowledge. 
As a result, being expert, ehich means having specialized knowlege on specific subject creates team spretual with other expert easily, increase concentration and creates focun on the target and at last creates big achivement, so we need expert in order to courage big achievements."
786,0,"We all are interested in reading about cars and dream of owning a car. It is one of the first few items that we plan to buy if someone asks us what we would do if we win a lottery ? If we observe the recent trend in car manufacturing, the demand for cars is ever growing. I dont think there is any chance that people will stop using cars in years to come. Infact I feel that in twenty more years, this craze of buying a car is going to multiply even further and there will be more cars in use than there are today. 

Twenty years is a very less time span to let go off a luxury like owning a car. Owning a car has become a status symbol. People want to own a car just beacuse it improves their standing in the society. In less developed countries, the level of noise and air pollution created by the use cars is unbeleivable. Laws and regulations have little effect on the demand for cars in these countries. 

Car manufacturing industry is a huge industry with a turn over of millions of dollars per month all over the world. Who would possibly give up such a profitable business ? Instead we are going to see more number of new and new cars & more number of commercials attracting people to buy these cars in coming years.

People are not going to stop using cars overnight. So many factors come into play when we talk about not using cars. The governments will have to improve the public transport to a level wherein people will prefer travelling by public commute rather than using a car. That looks like a distant possibility in some nations.

 Modern technology has invaded our lives to a level where man finds it difficult to survive without it. Cars, cellfones, television sets, music systems, washing machines, refrigerators and other such things have become a part of our life. We cannot think about living a life which lacks in the comforts given by these modern machines. Car is just one of the many things man has created for his own comfort. 

Man has failed to realise that these machines are causing more harm than their known uses. These modern machines have ruined our earth's atmosphere and oneday will lead us to extinction. If we want to survive, we will have to take one big step towards minimising the use of these machines specailly cars that cause so much of pollution."

    In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today, since the population is increasing, and that will cause a lot of traffic problems such as crowded street, and the way of transportation. We can solve this problem by using trains and planes more than cars. In the other hand, people will not buy cars more if they face a lot of trafic crowd. While the population is increasing, I think there will be a new laws, and restriction of using cars. Also, the tax will increase on the people who have more than enough of cars in their home.

    People will go smoothly for the trains and planes for their transporations. This will reduce the crowd, and they can arrive quickly without facing any troubles. Also, the development of the technology will increase, and the people will go to the technology and they will not take care of the cars.

It can look like too vertical expressions, but I absolutly agree with the author. I believe that If the passion about  enjoying of life is offer to pleasure in life, the age is doesn't matter to enjoy our life. 
 	I'd like to say the passion and curiocity as the critical thing to enjoy our life ratter than simply age. I can understand the young people and nomally more energetic and exciting than old people.

4389,0,"Who doesn't know advertisements for for sporting articles, like NIKE or Adidas or for cars, like the new Mercedes or simply for foods, like milk? In these advertisements the products are looking always good or aren't they?
So the question what I want to discuss now is, if the advertisements make products seem much better, than they really are.

On the one hand I think that the products that are advertised are very, very bad, because it is often shown only the whole article and in most of the cases never the details. You only have to look at the case of food, because there are often pesticides found, when this food gets tested in labors. I think everybody can remember the chocolate chaos at the big supermarket Hofer in Austria.
Also the advertisement of cars looks always superb, but in reality there are so many failures, as I have seen on the car of my father. With this car we always had problems, because the electric was not well working.
As a result of these failures there will also be danger for humans be affected, from the bad technic, as well as from the underaverage bad food.

But on the other hand I think, that the products, which are shown in an advertisement are really as good as they seem, because behind this products it is very often a lot of innovation. Who doesn't know the NIKE Air System in shoes? It was a simple development in the past, but today still works, because the people know, that this is as good as in the advertisement.
Moreover I think, that products, which have been tested for long terms by the companies, will increase more and more on quality and finally it is possible to itentify this product with the advertisement.

As a conclusion I would say, that neot everybody should look only at the advertisements."
3961,0,"Method of studying is always different from student to student.Many people hold their perspective to undestand ideas and concept while other prefer to learn facts.I too beileve that it is more important for student to understand concept and ideas than to learn facts.The reason, I think this way is because understanding ideas and concept clearity increase the creativity of student and it gives better knowledge for further growth.Concept clearity and clear ideas provide better foundation for future education of student.
One reason ,I believe that concept clearity and clear ideas give better foundation to a student is because if we understand ideas and concept then we never forget the subject.Take my own example ,When I was student I always preferred to concept clearity.I still remember the concept of Newton's Laws;because my physics teacher of grade 10 had my concept clear about this subject.Therefore it is always better to clear the concept and ideas so that we will never forget the same.
Another reason ,I believe that concept clearity and understanding ideas is important is that it increase the creativity of student.When we understand the concept of any theory then we feel more innovative to discover some more things.In fact every scientific discovery was started from fifferent ideas.For example,When Adison had understand the concept of electron and atom then only he could concluded that electrons can be used to flow electricity.This is how understanding concept about atom lead to the discovery of electricty.
All these are not to say that to learn facts are all use less.Facts are related to generally past which is also important.But advantages of learning facts can not surpass the advantages of clearing concept and understanding ideas.
In short,In this scientific world ,student with capability of learning ideas and with clear concept has better future than those who learn fact only"
8426,0,"The statement ""in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today"" contains a lot of aspects which can be analysed.

First of all, i do not agree fully with the statement given. These are some predictions of what may happen in the future with our everyday transport:

In twenty years' time technology will have advanced importantly.  Nowadays, the population in becoming aware of the Earth's environmental problems. A great amount of the society recycles, and does not waste energy. Many scientists are investigating new ways to save energy. And cars and transports in general are one of the most polluting producers. Is there a non polluting substitute for them?

Today, many investigators are looking for an alternative to cars that will not destroy the Earth. There are already some cars that work with petrol substitutes, but they are not very popular. If we found a way to preserve the environment without not using our cars, there would not be fewer cars in the future, but safetier for the planet.

Some examples of non polluting transports are becoming popular in many parts of the world, like bycicles. Many people, mostly persons who live alone or without children, take their bycicles to go to work or the city. But this alternative cannot be accepted by everybody as there not everyone lives alone or in the city. 

In my opinion , the only way the number of cars will decrease in the future is with new technological inventions. Maybe in twenty years time we will all travel around by private planes, or by flying skates...Who knows? It all depends on our future inventors and their imagination to create an easier and less polluting way to travel."

However this solutions don't always the best option because before the fix the problem, this problem incresead to make the other results that the people want to solutioning.

The comunication center like TV, radio, news paper and internet (generally in the last years) have made a change in the human life, to make that the human be a compulsived in the shopping. Now, no is necesary go to shopping a ohter place of the town or the world because with just a call, the man can buy from the house. 

So the comunication center thought the advertisements show the things that the man want to heard or see, for example product that showed a woman a few clothes make the man disare buy this product  (this cases is always seeing in the products like the beer or diferents licors). 

Other case is the offer that show in TV whice offered a cost that no is really economic just find lie and bring news members.   

This problem make that the man buy things that aren't necesaries and cannot received garante for the products which bring inconvenient.

I think it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects instead of working on a specific one. I am a biologist. I have graduated from the universtiy 3 months ago. I am  very hard-working and ambitious student. I always wanted to be best and get high marks from the exams. I think i achieved this. But sometimes i think that whether it was good or not to be ambitions like me. 
When i look those days i thing that i wish i was not so ambitions. I could have thougt that there were many things in the world more then exams and schol. Life is not worth living wihout noticing events that happen around you and also what was happened in the past. Why i say this?  Past. 
One of my hobby is reading about history. I would really concerned about how people were living in the past. Their cultures, customs, behaviors to each other and differenced between generations. Because i belive that this is a chain. What we do today will be related to the past. Those are our ancestor and we are the hiers. Every one should know something about their country' s history.

10052,0,"To understand the ideas and concepts and be able to utilize them is more important for students. Once the ideas and concepts are clear to the students, they can easily relate those ideas or concepts to their own life experiences. I agree with the statement because this is how I learn in the high school.

A good example can be seemed while my Physics teacher is teaching us the concepts of volecity and factors. In order to make us understand that volecity is composed of different factors in different directions, the teacher gives an example of swimming in a river. As most of the students has experienced or known that when there is a current in the river and the swimmer is swimming right across the river, he will not actually go straight across the river because the current is carrying him downstrean as he swims forward. This really makes a lot of sense to all of us before we start learning any formulas. However, if the teacher just want students to learn the fact that the swimmer will go across the river adjusent to where he sets off by illustrating with a right triangle, I will probably be the first one to be confused.

With the same source in my  Math class, this idea comes to me when my teacher tells us a story of his own. My math teacher used to be a straight-A student in the high school, and he did not care much about understanding the concepts of the course materials. Instead, he solved the problems with formulas like a machine that does not know what exactly"
1293,0,"The idea of teaching may be described in few steps. The first step will ofcourse be the theory. To understand a given subject one should know what is already there, what exists. After that, as the second stage they will need to learn what is said about the existing case. A person becomes a student to learn, learning includes learning how to think.

For instance if you are reviewing a company as it's general director, you should first know the basic things like it's field of production or expertise, capital, number of workers, its current standing in the market. After knowing what is there, you may start to create your ways of carrying the company forward. The things you have to learn in the first step are the facts. When you are ready to walk on, you start taking ideas and concepts on how develop.

It is similar for a new learner student. If he or she doesn't know that two times two equals four, he or she will never understand the basics of mathematics. After learning the main rules and factors they may look into ideas and concepts that have formed around the facts. So saying that a kid refusing to learn the main rules of math will be a genius in the future, under the name of open mindedness may be nonsense. If only the factors were tought to students they would probably become narrow minded people and never get to see different aspects of life. So combining the two becomes a must. While knowing the facts one should also understand the ideas about it.

From this frame I would like to state that understanding ideas and the concepts is need for a student to be able to see different point of views towards a single subject, but it doesn't carry a meaning without knowing what the subject is which is formed by gathering of the factors."

For the considering the universities ,it is unbelievable that this  problem of the university is keep going for very few years at least in my country, I think it takes a lot of year to cope this problem too. 

 In my country  the specializing in one specific subject is more spreaded  for the university,and my opinion is parallel with this idea.

In terms of the universities or in companies,this statement which  i agree with is more useful.As an instance of this situation is  that in lectures  according to a student for the  taking the course from a person who is specialized on that course is so much  educated rather than the taking  from the person who is not really interested in that course that much.In addition by this way the quality of the educating is certainly rise up.

This is also undeniable that in order to graduating from the universities you have to be successfull all over the lectures that you took in . This already means that when you finished  oyur school you already have many broad knowledge about the department you have.

Shortly this seperated educations is involve so much inefficient for the rest of life of  the students.

To sum up, by the  increasing the people who specialized in one specific subject, make our country or our world in a high position,and i think this is not a dream and this may come real ."

The most people who had great work's experentes think that the student who are still studying in the school or university should to take broad knowledge of many acadmic subjects, because they think that it is better to childrens to get carrer when they grow up. However, I do not agree with those people, and i think take one specific subject only is better than anthor. I will list my spcial reasons in the following.
	First of all, I just think that take one specific subject and study it very well is much better than study a lots of kinds of subjects. Because a person who only need take one of subjects could live well in the world, and if this guy can learn it very well, then, this guy will become a famous person in this subject. If a person who study broad knowledge of many acadmic subjects will not learn very well i think, because one have no enough time to take those subject very, only can half-understand about this subject.
	secondly, rght now, in the world most companys which always need some guy who is professional in one's subject area, because they have no time to get  some person who is not good at this subject, and to teach one how to work on it, they would like to get some guy who is good at this subject, because this guy are really take well on this skills, and do not need to spend time for study it again. On this way, the company who take this preson will have better infulence of work.
	Finally, I think a prson who studly a lots of kinds of subject is not good, because those guy will spend a lots of time on those subject and cannot take it well. The reason is not those guy are stupid, just because it is too difficult. Everybody should know that the time is money for us, we have not idea to find it back, so we have to treasure the every hour and every minutes, ever every seconds.	
	In the concultion, I just think the people who are only take one subject is better to study on a lots of kinds of subject, and this way will make more earier on one's road of life."

First, they are more and more interested in their own interest rather than social problems because of bad economic situation. As the economic situation are becoming  worse, young people lose their interest for the society and only show their interest in their own benefit. Compared to the scene of universities in 70s and 80s, today's university students don't seem to take action for their communities. In the past, universty students are the symbole of efforts to make better society. They had their own clear view towards community and spent lots of time taking part in developing society. However, today most of the young think they don't have time to do that. Instead of that, they spend thier time to go the private academys to develope thier own carrer.
Second, there are lots of things for the youngsters to enjoy. They spend most of their time to enjoy their own interest such as watching moves, shopping, or playing games.  Fewer students take part in activities to help communities. When there was a chace to volunteer for the work in rural area, it was hard to find the students who were willing to go in my school.

4890,0,"Whether having broad knowledge of many academic subjects or being specialized in one specific subject also benefits the society. The society requires both types of scholars to develop smoothly. I think that being broadly trained and specialized also depends on the personnal ability. What level you are educating is additionally a concerning issue for such consideration.

Our society needs specialists such as engineers and doctors as well as broad trained people, politicans for instance. All of them have their special roles in the society and the society would become choatic without either of them. Of course engineers and doctors could only be specialized in one subject as they are the experts in their fields and they should then spend all of their time on their specialized subjects. However, for politicans, many of them are rather broadly trained in several subjects including economics, history and languages so that they would be able to know what the residents want and how to promote the policy. 

A second crition on being specialized or not is depending on the personnal ability. Some people are gifted in certain abilities they should then being specialized while some people learn several different things very quickly, they might then be broadly trained in various academic subjects. Education and learning would be a funny process if you realize what your strengths are. 

Moreover, the last but the most important reason for choosing between having broad knowledge or being specialized in one subject is what are your educating level. If you are the primary and secondary school students, you should probably have broad knowledge instead. A good basic knowledge in every academic subjects is essential for the choosing what subjects you would be learned deeply in the future. You could not choose your right subjects if you do not have any knowledge in it. Also much knowledge is based on the same basis and theory such as physics is sticked to mathematics, you could not then learn physics without knowing any mathematic equations. If you are a college or postgraduate students, you might be specialized then. As time is limited but knowledge is unlimited, you could not thus learn everything else in depth in such a limiting time. 

Therefore there is not absolutely good to choose having broad knowledge of different academic subjects or specializing in one certain subjects, it all depends on the above critia. Our society needs different types of people and everyone should have a right to find out any subjects they want to learn."

In the early 1990's the production of cars have recently started. Since those years cars have been a production to the world wide industry and a famous traveling comfort to the world. The worst fact about the car is the liquid it needs to consume in order to run. That liquid is called Petroleum which mostly many cars need to use in order to work. Oil has been the primary source of energy for cars to start its engine. 
So many cars around the world have been produced at a high amount which equals the same amount of oil being purified and changed to petroleum for cars. Mostly every car gives out a deadly gas that it dissolved into the air. This makes air pollution occur and at today stage the world is suffering from a great jeoperdy of killing the enviroment with these emissions. The oil produces a very bad gas that is released and covered in the air. Mostly many trees around the area can cover it up with oxygen but with the cars being produced at a fast pace problems will occur. 
The enviroment is already suffering from air pollution also some countries have already suffered the air pollution and as the outcome many citizens have to go out covering their faces because they could get killed. It is proven a fact that if you stay in a room filled with the gas car produces you can get killed because of the oxygen taking up less space. The whole world is looking at it as a great problem because it affects the enviroment greatly. It is increasingly making the wold suffer greatly.
I believe that the best solution to the problem is to stop the production of vehicles that produce heavily disturbed gas. Mostly the older cars from the 1990's give out worst emissions than cars today. Most new companies have to create a different source of energy for cars. In the world today the production of hybrid cars have started and it is a healthy car for the enviroment. It doesnt affect the enviroment at all. Also that in the end oil is about to become extinct because we are using it for almost every energy production. Oil will not exisist and cars will have to run over a new energy source like hybrid.
In conclusion I believe that in twenty years there are going to be less cars because of the enviromental problems it is causing and the oil becoming extinct. Even though new inventions of technology is being discoverd the official car of today will be not used much. The new technology will change the cars status so it can gain benefits for both the humans and the world's enviroment."
9740,0,"Communities , nowadays , need for help more than any time before , especialy from their youngmen . I think that youngs should prepare enough time to build up their societies , otherwise , they will not go ahead.
    There are no doubts that youngs should grab their communities hand to move ahead , or they will collapse infront of their eyes.
      When you switch the pages of the history ,you will see many examples of great nations that plunged because of the egnoreness of their young people. The Greek , for example , reached at one time to a high place that no one else reached before , but it collapsed suddenly , why ??? because their youngs do not give their nation enough time to build and to help.
      Young people , recently , are completely different from the youngs from the previous times. Maybe they are differ on ways of thinking or on ways of acting against situations. I am not saying that they are better than them but I am pointing that the more resposible the youngs are, the more powerful their nations will get.
       Once a wiseman said "" The society is for the person and the person is for the society "" ,,, what did that mean ?? It meant that when a person is fully resposible to his community and he is ready to give his soul to her , his community will be ready to him and she will rise and rise. The more powerful the country are, the more powerfull their nations are.
        Finally , I think that what young people is saying about not having enough time to give for their nations is nonsense , because the time is always here but the will and care are not here."
8461,0,"""Knowledge is power"", we would definitely agree that the more knowledge people have, the greater achievements they will accomplish. However, as one's life time is limited, he/she is always faced with the choice of studing broad knowledge of many academic subjedts  and specializing in one specific subject. As a graduate student, having a broad knowledge of various subjects is a wise choice for me.
First of all, the world is ever changing and as an undergraduate student, I cannot definitely decide what occupation I will take after my graduation. I can not specialize in on specific subject too early because doing so will certainly constrain my career development. Suppose I have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects, I would definitely have a greater chance to choose my potential occupation; on the contrast,if my knowledge is too specialized, my choice will be limited.
Secondly, the society calls for person with comprehensive knowledge. For example, a business firm come to my school recruiting employees. The students the favor is those business school students with engineering backgrounds. They think those people can have a more prosperous career future. This is not a rare case, for the compitition in society is getting more and more fierce, so a person with comprehensive knowledge has more chance to succeed. And having broad knowledge of many academic subjects surly does good to this.
Besices, studing broad knowledge of various subjectsj helps to foster one's interest. By reading books of different fields, you can experience different ways of thinking and find your interest; while concentrate on one specific subject provides you with less chances to experience different topics.
Though a person should be specialized in one specific subject for survival because only having broad knowledge does not help you stand out among others, studying broad knowledge of various academic subjects is a wise choice for an undergraduate student."
6149,0,"I agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today for the following reasons.

First of all, driving cars will spend more money than other public traffics because the price of car fuels, gasoline and gas oil, will be raising. For example, I remember that in 2003 when I was in my first year at Showa-Shell-Sekiyu, a large oil company in Japan, gasoline price of Japanese market was less than one dallor. However now, it is raised about one half dollars. As the above example shows, driving cars will spend more money than other public traffics.

Second, people will be thinking about environment more deeply and make a new low that limited the number of cars. For example when I was a eleventh grader at Okayama Joto High School, a public high shool in Japan, I was able to swim in the river next to my high school after school. But now, the river has been very duty because the new road was made by the river and a lot of drivers throw away their garbage in the river. At last, our city makes a new low of emitting from the gas oil cars. If the number of cars had been increasing, the beautiful environment would have lost away. As the above example demonstrates, people will be thinking about environment more deeply and make a new low that limited the number of cars.

In conclusion, I strongly agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today."
1746,0,"I agree with the statement given. because it is important to teach the students to understant what they are being tough. 

There is an old chinesse saying that; if you want to save somebody from his or her hunger, you have to teach him or her to how to hunt instead of giving him or her; a fish to feed with. if a student or a child does not understants the ideas or the concepts that are being tough to them they will simply memorize the subject but not learn from it.

Some school systems or training programs are build on the student or the attendent to memorize what is being given to them which does kill their imagination and does not prepare them to life. for example couse and effect can be tough to a student in a science class and most of the childeren if not interested specificlly will not enjoy the science class as a social science student I hate it. If a child does not understant the reasons of a couse and effect situation she or he will not use it to understand peoples reactions about her or his actions. If a science teacher teaches you the couse and effect principal via giving you examples of your ordinary life, examples of what you do dailly actions you will understand what you learn. if not just make it an experiment in a lab class you wont remember it until the examination time and after that never. 

When you memorize something it is a great risk fort you to forget it. and it will happen because our brains are like computers. As we do to make our computer when it is full wiht information and becasue of that its speed slows and does not work more effectively. We must delete some old informations to get new ones. And the first information it will delete will be the one you do not remember or do not understand why it happens, the one it is put in without any meaning. If teachers and parents are the ones that shapes our personality and future they must be very carefull to teach the young minds with a great hunger how to fish not to give us a fish just for once."
11029,0,"""Everything was better In former times."" I guess all young people know sentences like this from their parents or grandparents in particular with reference to the opinion that young people nowadys do give enough time and energy to supporting the communities they live in. But is this true?

In my essay I will debate, if peolpe spend enough time and enery to helping their community. In particular I will highlight why the help of young people is bitterly needed as well as why also young people would benefit from helping their communties.

In my opinion young people, particularly teenager and twens could and shoul help much more in their communities.

Firstly, I think, nowadays budgets of communities are often almost empty, and as a result, much help is needed. Lots of municipalities do not know how to provide services, e.g. for older peolpe - preventing them from isolation - or for children. The only way of providing  these social services often is unpaid work of  residents. But as  far as I know only less young people are interested in providing time and effort to help their communities. They are more interested in having fun, traveling and planing their carrer. E.g. in my hometown almost all people working unpaid for the community are older than 50. Hence, I think the quality of community life would benefit from an increase of engagement of young people.

Moreover, I think also the personal development of young people would benefit from an increased social engagement. Nowadays young peolple - at least in Europe - often take anything for granted. They are not aware that we all depend on support and that lots of the things they take for granted cause much work. By doing it on their own they would learn to worship this work.

Taking all these points into consideration it can be stated that young peolpe increase their engagement for several reasons. Bot, the communities as well as themselves would probably benefit from it, however, it will need some time to realise."
8450,0,"Some people said young people nowadays doesn't help our cominities.  I supose that is true, but there are some reasons why young people doesn't help the comunities.  I think young people nowadays are very busy.  They have a lot of things even if they don't help their communities.  They have to go to the piano lessons or go to swimming, or do something.  Other children must study hard from early morning to midnight, because their parents wants them go to good univercity.  The other children have to help their housework.
     Young people nawadays often go to learn something even if holiday.  For example, piano, swimming, dancing and so on.  Therefore they don't have time to help their comminities.  Even though children want to help and join them, they have already many things to do.
     Most children study very hard, because their parents wants them to that.  Sometimes they may study from early mornig to late evening, or they study even it is on the holiday.  If there are the day children don't have to study hard, they want to be relaxed at home, or play with their friends.  Therefore, they don't have enough time to help their communities.
     These days, many parents work outsides thier house, so they need thier son or doughter's help, so children have to thier housework to help thier parents.  There are many housework.  For instance, clean their family's rooms, make the dinner, wash the dishes, wash their cloths, and so on.  Therefore if they have to do them, they are tired and they have no time to help their communities.
     Nowadays young people have a lot of things to do, I think, so they can't help their communities, even if they want to help them."
1832,0,"I believe that in the next twenty years there  will be decline in the number of cars used today. There are a few reasons why i think so
Firstly with the immense growth in the population and scarcity of space available to live and commute would decrease the number of cars. This is because travelling on the public transport would be much more convenient  than standing in the long traffic jams.
Second reason would be coming up of highly safe and convenient public transport systems. The government is working on such issues and by the end of twenty years would have excellent transportation system like public buses , trains, trams and metros which can take the person to his destination in much less time than the individual cars. e.g in capital of India i.e. Delhi, with the coming up of metros a lot of time is saved by the people working and commuting through cars.
Third reason i believe is spiralling prices of gas and petrol because of huge demand. This high cost of driving cars would discourage their use in coming years and will lead to fewer cars in use than there are today.
The non-renewable sources of energy used to drive cars are getting finished up slowly and slowly and fifty years from now would be a time when we would have no fuel left. So switching to public transport will also solve the problem and slow the process of depletion of these resources. 
Also with the increase in inflation in Indian economy, the common man is looking for alternate means to cut down the costs. So if a much viable and convenient solution is available then he would surely switch over to the use of cheap and better modes of transport. All these reasons combined would make the common man to willingly come out of his luxury of cars and use cheap and time -effective means of transport like buses , trains etc."
5015,0,"I agree with the statement that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts.

Basically our mind is like a fire which needs to be kindled and not a vessel to be filled up.  Ideas and concepts are the right catalyst to set our mind wondering and thinking on those topics.  Famous scientist Albert Einstein used the age old calculus to derive the theory of relativity.  

Our inventions and discoveries have relations to the past.  The present technologies owes a lot of its origin to the earlier generations.  We cannot do things abstract and all of a sudden out of the blue.  It may appear to have happened that way, when we superficailly go through the matter.  A deeper study reveals the connections, which are very interesting.

Facts are simple statistics.  They are very important.  They need to be collected and kept for rational reference.  We take decisions based on facts not on ideas and concepts.  So that is the role of facts in our life, I feel.  For example, if we need to know whether a specific disease has become an epidemic and if the government needs to msuter more support and put in more efforts to curb the further spreading of the disease, we need to know the number of patients registered at the hospitals with the symptoms of that disease recently.  These are essential in leading us to make a crucial decision.  Facts can be of various types.  Some about the past which would relate to the history of the land.  Some relate to who did what etc and some good to know information.  They have their importance in the society.  

A students life is very important phase in his career.  We need to choose carefully what he needs to understand to keep his inquisitiveness and mind in search of quests.  This will take us a long way in builing a society where there will be no deficieny of innovations, discoveries and inventions to acclerate us towards further growth and development."
3778,0,"nowadays people have to struggle to become someone, there is  competition since the first years of school. if you want to become an important person you have always to take risks: if you have a good idea ,that you think will be a succesful one, you have to develop it  and to accept the probability to loose everithing.
the greatest sportsmen can't do only what they already know but have to constantly improve their skills: for example a motogp rider during the weekend before the grand prix tries to develop his bike testing different solutions but he hasto choose only one.This is a risk: if he has taken the best decision he could win, othrwise he will loose.
Also at school if you have no time to study everithing for an exam you have to risk choosing the principal information that will be problably asked. Everithing depends on the questions: the exam will be a success or a failure, but it's far better try the exam."
7887,0,"In today's world it is a debate if knowing more is better or specializing in a subject is better. To specizlize in a subject may make you an expert about that subject but knowing little from every subject makes you only knowledgable to some degree. Therefore the decision may depend on which one you value most. 
	I would value to be an expert in my field. Knowing just a little about all subjects may give you the opportunity to talk about everything but when it comes to talking deeply, for example when somebody asks you about an important part that does not stand on surface, you may not be able to provide any answers. If you are specialized in the subject you will be able to give the answer. So having a broad knowledge of every subject may lead not knowing any subject fully. And if you have missing knowledge about that subject, I think if is better not to talk.  You may be able to talk about the subject but when it comes to academic speechs, where you should show your knowledge about the topic, you may fail to give enough information.
	In my opinion if a person talks about a specific question he must be knowledgable about all aspects of the question. To be able to give specific and not very known facts is more important than repeating the facts that are known by many people. I think repeating would be what the ones who are not specialized in a subject will do. 
	Moreover, today's society gives more credit to specialized knowledge in work environments. Firms usually prefer to hire people that completed the undergraduate level and also completed a graduate level which had given them the opportunity to specialize in their subject. The ones who successfully completed a graduate degree, who are knowledgable about all aspects of their field of study, become the ones who are most valued in the work place. They can find jobs more easily and they are paid more. For these reasons people try to specialize in a specific subject rather than having a broad knowledge of many academic skills.   
	I would like to enjoy better working environments with earning more money and I would like to be able to talk about every aspects of my subject. For these reasons I think specializing in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge about many subjects."
11997,0,"I didn't agree with the point of view that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. First reason is that i think travel is a very personal experience and that doesn't need many people come and finish with me. Second reason is that the travel agency will bring me to a fixed place and fixed time to travel places that most people should look and that also means I can't have enough time to take adventures. Third reason is that most of the tour guides really just provide limit and small information from the tour text books. I will provide more detail about my points. 

The first reason I didn't like to join a travel group is that I think travel is a very personal experience that is a process of dialuate with myself. I will enjoy the singal travel experience that I can read, stay with the local residents and sit down to write when I meet what touch my heart as my wish.

The second reason is that the travel agencies always provide some limit places that cost them less money and limit the time for the travel spots. So I can't have some more adventures to deeper places, talk with more people, and take more detail on the place. That is very pity. More over, they will bring me to some boring shopping centers that are always waste my time.

The third reason is the most important part to me that is the toup gides aren't  local residents or they are just provide too little information to me. Some even can't give me more information except from the tour gide text books. 

To my point of view, I didn't agree with the point that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. Because travel means to me is more personal, more relax time to go and to touch the things and to understand more about where are the culture differences. So fixed time and fixed places way of travel group is not just not my choice."
4779,0,"I agree with the statement,partly.Broad knowledge of many academic subjects is great,but focus on a specific subject is also very good.I think it depends on your age and your position in the company.
	When we are in the middle schools,it is better to have broad knowledge.A teenager don't know exactly what they want.They may
be eager to become a famous singer in the moring, and carzy about the idea of being a scientist in the midnight because of a sweet dream. And everyone's interest may change in the long run.When I loved the computer games in my 14 years old,I wanted to be a game designer.In every dream of mine,I studied computer science  in a famous high school.I attained the Blizzard Entertainmet Company(The most famous company which presents pc-games).I was the only focus in the E3(the greatest pc-games conference).But now,I lost my interest in pc-games.Being a doctor is more attrative to me.If I put all my passion on computer and gave up my schoolwork, no doubt I was regrating for that.
	But when we are in univercities, we should choose a subject to study.Today,no one can handle all knowledge.Everybody should know something deeply and corporate with others.As old chinese saying goes:""You know everything,you know nothing.""If you don't have your specific subject,you will find no job.Because everything you can do, there are many people who can do it better than you.
	Not only your age,your position in the company also determines whether you should have broad knowledge or specific subject.If you are the manager, you should know something about economics,administration,and the products you  provide.But if you are a staff,you should care about what exactly the company want you to do.
	So we can get a conclusion:both board knowledge and specific subject is needed,just thinking about  which is better for you."
460,0,"The fact to have fewer cars in twenty years than today depends on severals factors. In fact, some people think that the number of cars in few years will grow up because of people need, other think the contrary, they assert that its must decreases because we will be in need of another type of transportation. I support the fact in twenty year we will have more cars than what we have todays and that for the following reasons. 
Many reasons show that in twenty years the numbers of cars will increase. The foremost reasons is people want to move, to systisfy that need we have to used cars. for exemple people will always need to go to market , to travel , to visit  and to go to work they need for that the cars.
The second important reason is, population around the woprld is increasind and they  need the cars. for the old people and children the need of the cars  will always be important.
The third reason, is people want to live confortably and using  cars is confortable. for exemple when you want to travel with your family to visit someone is necessary to use a cars .
In addition governement build highways for cars that made people haven't fear of traffic jam, they are motived to buy cars. 
Finally,  peolple use the cars to make business , indeed, it is a big ways to make money nowadays by transporting people in big town.
As conclusion i can say  the need of people to move is everyday increasing, we need tha cars for business, to travel , to save time . All theses reasons show in twenty years the numbers of cars will increase compared to what we have today"
1198,0,"Every stage of live has its own priority and ways to enjoy the moment. I do think that young people and older people can both enjoy the life they are living. 
However the intesity with which someone can enjoy live mainly depends on the efforts and the sacrifices he had to do to reach to that point. In fact we can take the exemple of a young boy: his live, his universe is quite simple. A single simple thing can fulfill him like the consideration of his teacher when he has drown a beautifull tree or learnt a poetry. But I think to enjoy that moment of proudness he had to concentrate and to make an effort.
On the contrary, I am sure that some student who doesn't really work hard to succeed in his studies and who thinks that what he is doing is just enough to pass his exam can't really enjoy live. In fact even if he has all the time and the possibilities to go on hollidays and to party with his mates, he would soon or later fill that he is not doing his best and won't enjoy this live anymore. That's why I am depply convinced that in order to enjoy live, we have to see in our past and be proud of what we have been able to perform.
Moreover, after years of work in a very fullfiled career, older people have earned money that can allow them to travel, to have the live they have always dreamed of. But they have earn more than money during their career: they have earned the ability to be sincirely proud of what they have done. That is to say, the familly they have built, the education they have given to their child and the good memories they are giving to their grand-children. That is why I think that older people can enjoy live more than younger ones."
36,0,"Being successful is about knowing what you are doing and how you are doing it. But it's also about taking chances and working hard to seek your ambitions and aspirations. And to do so, people should try new things and take new chances. But at the same time, they should be very careful with their actions and decisions, so that they won't regret if anything had happened wrong.

First, In order to be successful, people should know exactly what they want and what they are looking for. For example, If a man wants to be successful in his job he needs to be working for something he really likes and he's really good at. And not doing something just because that was the only opprotunity he got. He should try and find what he is good at and find what he really wants. Having a successful life is about having a happy, fulfilled and satisfying life.

Second, People who want to be successful should go and find their own chances instead of just waiting for the chances to come to them. And if they passed through something hard along the way they should try their best to make it through without crumbling. They have to make the best out of everything.

Third, successful people have to obtain the knowledge and the wisdom on how to keep their success rising instead of falling. Being successful once doesn't mean that someday you won't be a failure. A person has to be confident in his work so that he wouldn't regret his actions later.

To become a seccessful person and to obtain that postition. You have to know what you are looking for, try to reach out for your goals, and being confident in what you are doing. And at the end you will have a happy life."
8326,0,"In some countries, there is a tough controversy about the final objective of education. Should it deal with a maximum academic subjects, so as to provide a vast general knowledge to the students, or should it rather focus on a specific matter, in order to prepare the youngsters to their confrontation with the professional world?
First, I am convinced that it is a nonsense to force the students to specialize too early. They have to try a great variety of subjects before genuinely being aware of what truely interests them. By granting them some time to think, a varied schedule will allow them to make a valid choice and to change their mind, if necessary.
Then academic subjects are often complementary. When you have the possibility to study a lot of different subjetcs, you can observe how they interact and get a more critical view on a particular topic. For instance, every human science tries to explain how human beings behave in a society: economy, philosophy, psychology, anthropology, they all give us a different theory about the way we choose, decide, react in our environment. By acquiring the basics in several of those subjects, a student will be able to shape his own opinion.
In addition, every subject has in his fundamental course some elements that belong to our society`s common knowledge. Our culture is defined by our history, as well as our litterature, but also what we know in biology, physics, art or even sport. Having a few hints about what is important to know in each field is a major requirement to understand current events, or more generally to gain tolerance to different opinions and beliefs.
However, I also want to advocate for the necessity of an eventual specialization. Indeed, before entering the professional world, being particularly skilled in a given field is a moajor competitve advantage. In the prospect of getting a job, a graduating student must think about what counts for the recruiters he will face. If you want to be a botanist, it may not be useful to pursue advanced macroeconomics."
3605,0,"I do strongly believe that young people enjoy life more than older people can do. 
	First of all i think that young people have something that frequently is not possesed by elderly ; that is good health. Good health means basically the possibility to travel all around the world and visit exciting new countries. It means also the possibility to practice new sports in the countryside or outside in the fresh air. For example 
But it is also necessary to live with dignity.
	Secondly, young people do not generally have great and impellent responsabilities but they can have a lot of freedom to go out with friends, go dancing , practice known sports , stay up late without any problem.
	Moreover the fact that elderly people can have some problems in concentrating and remembering the things they learn. This problem can seriously affect their chance to learn new things reading books, which I believe it is one of the greatest things to do to enjoy. Another really important fact is that young people have a great social life which often lacks in older people.
	To end up i would like to touch a very important issue that sadly affects our developed countries. In several important and crowded cities in the world it would be easy to find the majority of old people left alone in desolated apartments or even wostly in retirement houses.  The frenetic rythm of our society seem to emarginate the people regarded as unuseful so it is impossible for them to live in a life in wich every day is seen as a possible to enjoy life."
5764,0,"I disagree the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do because of some reasons. My some of the reasons to disagree that idea are ; first of all enjoying life does not connected to age completely, secondly when years are passed people get more experinced and finally older people understand life better than younger ones which help them to enjoy more.
	To begin with, lets try to define `enjoying`. Is enjoying related to your phsical situation? what i think is that enjoying is having fun and being happy in a certain time period which is not dependent to your phsical situation but your mental property. you can be very healthy about your muscles , organs and all your body but it doesnt mean anything if your mental condition is alright.  
	Additionally, experience is very important in life to enjoy it. A famous singer says `i know what it is to be young but you dont know what it is to be old` when he reached the considerably old ages. People who lived a lot of things -which can be consired as `taste` in life - learn how to defend and stand for bad happenings and it must help them to be happy even if they are in very bed situations.
	Finally, life is not very easy to understand and identify. Every second passed through our life helps us to achive the understanding of the aim and that identification of life. This identification helps people to enjoy since the unavoidable end of this life is to `die` . Young people live as if they will never die whereas olders see that end easier than the youth that philosophical finish.
	Hence, i dont believe the idea that older people enjoy life less than the younger people do because i think it doesnt completely dependent on age and the reasons i mentioned above. I see a lot of young people  never enjoy whereas  a lot of very old people smiling and having fun with their friends."
2993,0,"I do agree that the advertisements makes products seem much better than they really are.Infact it is a art that has developed with new era and new technology. It is a means of atrracting their costumers to buy their product.
Advertising industry has grown for decades and still growing today.With the invention of computers grafics any product in the market can be made very beautiful and irresistable.The advertisement is eye catching and it gets registered into your mind.So when you go to the market,even if the product is not useful,you end up buying it only because the beautiful side of the product has been inculcated into your mind.
Lets take an example of a perfume.In the advertise the perfume bottle was in a shape of a lady and it was being used by Jenifer Aniston.T hat had registerd into my mind and i was wanting tho buy the perfume for a long time.One fine day I finall got a cance to go buy it.The  price of the perfume was unbelievable,it was so expensive.But i wanted it at the image of Jenifer holding the bottle just din't go out of my mind,and guess what?I finally ended up buying it.Even today I regret to the purchase that I made that day as till today the perfume bottle is only half used as I no more like its smell.But that was a lesson for me, and today I keep control on myself and donat get waved away by such fantasies created by the advertisements.
I realize that I am not the only one,there are millions of people who has had this kind of experience. But the key thing to ask is,do these people realise how they are trapped by the advertisement industry.I guess there wouldn't even be 1% of the entire crowd who understands this strategy used by the advertisement agencies.
This is one of the major reasons for the fast growth of the advertising companies.But 'yes' I do agree to the fact that the advertising agencies are doing a very good job and has a great effect on people's mind."

They work very hard to participate in the world trade and in forming a strong economy. They attempt also to raise their life standard and this includes the purchase of cars. 
In first world countries a car is a sign of wealth and independence. As long as there are no further inventions to replace cars this will not change in such a short time as 30 years. Maybe the gas will change to renewable resources but in the end a car means more comfort and independence and that is what nowbody wants to give up.
That is why I do not think that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today."
6941,0,"Parents always say that you have to work very hard at your younger age, so as to enjoy your older age. I don't think that this is a valid deal cause I dont think that I will be able to enjoy more in my older days than when I am young. Cause at older age you would like to settle down in a calm village and enjoy the peaceful and pleasant climate rather than living in a crowded city, with lot of things happening around you and that interests you. 

At your younger age, you will have the energy to go around different places and view some of the beautiful creations in the world. But  when you become old, maybe your health will not allow you to do adventures. At your younger age, you have many things to enjoy because of less responsibilities and  more energy. At young age you can also have a great enjoyment with your romantic life too. Enjoying to the highest at your younger age and also working hard to get settled in the future is my moto of life. Normally people think that they will enjoy there life after they are old and they only work . But this can be harmfull if they dont get a chance to enjoy at thier older stage after so many years of hardwork. 

Normally youngsters do enjoy a lot by arranging disco parties and trips to different locations with friends. They get in touch with the latest technologies and gadgets like ipods, mobile phones, games  and many more. They do spend a luxurious life. Youngsters also enjoy sports and have a abilitiy to take part in it. 

So finally I can say that, young people enjoy more than older people with respect to health, responsibilties, technology and much more. So, I prefer enjoying my younger age and getting settled in my older age."
1615,0,"People travel to all over the world for various reasons.Some do it because they want a change in their lives ,whereas others do it beacause they want to explore the world and want to know about that place,the people and their culture.
                             Hence, I feel that if the reason is to explore the world or the place, the best thing is to do in a group led by a tour guide.A tour guide is a person who is professionally qualified to help and show people the places they are travelling to,so it would be really easy  if you are with a tour guide.Also,travelling in a group has its own charm.You are not only enjoinyg a new place but also you are sharing your experience and your joy with others too.
                                     Although ,I do agree if we are travelling in groups we dont possess the amount of freedom we would enjoy when we are alone but being in groups with a tour guide is beneficial in many other ways.Firstly,since he is an expert you will get to explore and see all important places which you might miss if you are travelling alone.For example you might just miss amonument and you later regret that you might have consulted a tour guide.Also,by chance if you face any kind of problems you have so many people helping you out.For example,you might have a problem with your health in a place which is new to you.It  might be great cause of concern,whereas if you are travelling in a group you have so many people to count on.
                                           Also,there are people in this world who do not have families or friends these kind of groups are really beneficial for them.It has been seen that after spending days together you really beacame friends even after you finish off with your trip.
                   When people travel in groups they spend all extra time singing,enjoing,dancing with each other.Even the time you spend on travelling becomes so exciting.
                          To summarise I would say that travelling in groups led by a tour guide do take away some part of your freedom but it provides you with a real defination of enjoyment and excitement which you can never enjoy all alone."

7198,0,"I agree with the statement but I have to point out several issues.

	I believe times have changed therefore we cannot expect young people to behave in the same way as young people from the past did. They might not give enough time to helping their communities but this could be due to a lack of time and different targets. 

	Nowadays young people are individualistic because we live in a society that focus on individuals rather than on communities. By the same token, young people focus on themselves and they prefer to invest their time in selfish activities instead of community services.

	I consider myself a young person and out of my experience I can say that I am not interested in communities at all. Furthermore, I have lived in several countries and what really strikes me is the fact that young people behave completely different depending on the country that they live in.  For instance, in Sweden guys are extremely independent whereas in Spain are much  less independent likewise Spanish guys might care more about communities than Swedish guys do. So in order to understand the question it is needed to place it in a specific context. 

	The responsible of such situation is the society because society is constructed around individuals, rules are made according to what is the best for individuals thus they became the most important thing. Nonetheless, it is possible to notice strong nationalistic movements in Europe that emphazises on communities. If European communities become strong, it would be a change regarding young people's attitude hence they would give enough time to helping their communities.

	To conclude, I agree with the statement but some aspects need to be considered before talking about young people and their attitude. Young people behave completely different depending on the country that they live in and their culture, however,all in all it can be said that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities."
4614,0,"Here the question is about having an broad knowledge about many academic subjects we have learnt or by doing the specialization in a particular subject what we have learnt.I consider doing specilization in a particular subject is mainly necessary.I give some examples why it is so in below paragraphs.

          I consider specilization in a particular subject is good and necessary because, in a particular acedemics we dont concentrate on all off the subjects.We like only one of the subject.We learn more about the subject if we do specilization in a particular subject.It increases my intrests to learn more about the subject.There is an saying like""what we have learnt is like a drop in an ocean"".This state ment is true because,we have only learnt some amount.There is lot of thing to learn  next.We can do research in a  particular field of intrest and learn more about the subject which we can implement in the society which leads to good results.
                We can also go into the researching field of our intrest and into the teaching field by showing our intrests towards our subject.For example if we have intrests in the general chemesty subjects we must do our specilization in that and do researches and go and experiment on our universe.If we are intrested in any of the pharmaceutical field we can do our specilization and do Phd program by discovering many drugs on  a particular research.As the present society is filled with many diseases the drug discovery plays an important role.If we are intreasted in politics or journalism, we must do the specilization in the particular subject and must go into the politics or as an journalists,this is why because in the present societ we are lacking in educated politicians.

                   Finally, I conclude from my above paragaraphs that the specilization in a particular subject is necessary why because it influnces the society a lot.As i mentioned that what we have learnt is just a drop in the ocean proves my above examples.Finally, this is my view about doing specilization in a particular subject."
8061,0,"With the rapid development of society and technology, the cars we use today migh have something different in the future.  I strongly agree that  there will be fewer cars in use than there are today twenty years later in consideration of economic, earth-friendly, and technological factors.
     First,  the great number of cars and the shortage of oil trouble many industrial countries in the world.  Generally speaking, cars are proved to be the worst efficient transportation.  It is because that we usually drive alone but a car can take at least four people at a time.  The space is not used is a waste of time and money.  People will rethink about the necessarity of driving cars, especially when the price of the oil is so expensive.  Driving cars is not an economic choice at all today.
     The second reason why I think cars will be replaced soon is that cars bring out too many disadvantages to both human and the earth.  Even though that sometimes people think that it is very convenient to drive a car, it cause more pollution than we expect, such as noise and air pollution.  Many studies show that the air pollution caused by cars have negative impacts on the fertility of animals.  Not mention that the noise pollution causes health problems.  Therefore, I think the natural resource on earth, the most precious treasure shared by all human and animals, should be protected by using less cars.
     Lastly, technologies will change the way of life when it comes to the desperate needs of customers.  Many scientists and businessmen today are looking forward to having some new mass transit system or inventions to replace the cars.  Take the Internet for example, people can take online course and  do online shopping without driving out.  Hence, maybe twenty years later, we do not need cars to go to another place.  Instead, we can do all the things by the aids of technologies in communication and transportation.
     In summary, I believe that the numbers of cars will decrease in twenty years for cars consume too much oil, cars cause a series of pollution, and more cutting-age mass transit system will be provided.  As a result, I think that the decreasing of cars will be just around the corner."
9153,0,"The statement given to me is ""It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts""
	I completely disagree with the statement because without learning facts its mere waste on spending time on ideas and concepts.Learning facts help us to grow knowldege and to know what is right and what is wrong....FACT is a powerful word used in this society.Without knowing the facts we cannot know or we cannot take a step forward to start anything new until and unless we r told about that fact.It bulids the curiosity of an induvidual.
	For example  recently we see that Sunitha Rao an astronomist went into space and she is residing over there for 6 months to know all the so called facts over there in the space...she stated that she has seen the planet Earth from the space as that of a small star...
	As such students they should know the facts about everything around themsleves...if a fact is known then we can understand the ideas behind it bring out all the concepts in that particular fact....They help us in bringing out the universal truths into light.They help us in buliding up our knowledge and our skills too.We get interest to invade most of the facts hidden in particular thing in which a fact is there....
	Coming to the part of ideas and concepts of understanding as im aganist to it.They help in just bringing out the idea or concept behind that... thats all.But knowing the facts is very essential .
	Last but not the least FACTS play a very imporant role in ones induvidual life and curiosity is increased for a knowing  the fact..."
3493,0,"As you all know many students choose to learn what it is written in their books rather to see the main idea behind it. This leads to developing generations, who waits for others to think and accept their ideas as a truth without questioning it. So it is very importent for young people to understand the ideas and concepts than to learn facts.
	Firstly, when you are taking a math class or any other subject related to science you have to learn the main principles of the subject in order to succeed. For example you cannot just say something falls down when it is dropped. You have to know that there is an external force called gravity, which keeps all subjects on the ground or make them fall when they are in the air. Without understanding the main reason or thinking about the cause you cannot make any progress for yourself and the others.
	Secondly, it is not only true that someone should learn the main ideas for the science related subjects. Also in other areas like history or politics (especially in politics) you should know the reason why something happened or going to happen. Unfortunetlly many students believe that history is only about learning wars or important charecters in order, but history is more than that. Without the background information on the facts, for example the WWII, you will never understand why the Americans have to go into Europe in order to support England. In this example it is important to understand that England was the only country against the Nazi-Germany and needed help in order to prevent the groth of Nazi-Era, but without this information it will be just another war in the human history.
	Finally many students say that they have many thinks to learn and to understand the idea behind everything requires much time, but that is only a misunderstanding. Especially in engineering subjects, such as programming, you cannot learn every single command, because there are to many of them! The main points of programming is to know how to build an algorithm and how to translate it into the programming language needed. The rest can be done by everyone with a little experience in computers.
	To sum up, facts are nothing compared to the ideas behind them. In order to take an important part in the society people should produce their own ideas, otherwise they will be nothing more than a slave. In order to do that you need to understand the main ideas."
6129,0,"It seems on the first blush that older people donot have got much work to do, so they might enjoy their lives. However when one mulIs over the issue with a brainstorming, it is the younger ones who take leisure the most. Hence I more or less agree with the statement that 'The young people enjoy life more than the older people do', by putting following examples.

This is the twenty-first century. What allures almost each and everyone of us about this is the 'rapid advancement in globalization'. 
The world, day-by-day, is becoming a shorter place to live in. It does possess all the amenities which are needed for a luxurious life.
Now, who doesnt want to visit incredible continents like- Africa, Antarctica, America, asia etc.? Well, I surmise almost everyone of us. But mostly it is the younger generation who enjoy.

The younger generations do have a spunk and an energy within themselves which have made it possible for the world to shrink in the sphere of tchnological advancements. With the aid of technology, the youngers exploit good reasons for having fun and enthusiasm.
The wild parties on the exotic beaches of Hawaii, itinerary for majestic and adventuruos wild sanctuaries of Africa and Asia, and many more are done and planned by the current generation.

Older people, on the other hand, live their lives in a solitary by enjoying in their ways, as they become physically shattered due to the old age. However, the younger generation, often called the 'M tv Generation'- believes in a sole entertainment along with the advancements. For example, we often see younger people enjoy the safaries in Serrengitti(Africa), as they have a privilege of exploring more and more as they are young. Moreover, the amazing stunts of sky-divers and hearthrobbing experiences of the underwater-divers are most prevalent amongst the novices and the young ones.

It is, once in a blue moon, that an older guy attains some accolade and is praised. To the contrary, the young persons of the society receive kudos often frequently. This clearly explains that the young people enjoy in a much better way.


However, I believe that the young ones should not be sybarites, that is, there should never be a feeling of hedonism amongst them. As they have a privilege of enjoyng the grand and august life of this contemporary era, they should exploit it in a healthy manner, rather than milking out the pleasures of the other older people, who ones were young and naive. It should be the blend of the older people's experience and the vigor within the youngs which can lead to the prosperity of the world."
788,0,"While we are studying it is good to know what should I learn. Should I keep working in a subject that I already master or shoud I developpe a wildspread culture ? On one side I could specialize in order to become one of the best in what I am doing but having no abilities to recycle myself in another suject, while in the other hand I can learn enough to have an overall culture and knowledge but no special skill.

A lot of scientific developpement wouldn't have happened if scientist just focused on one subject. For instance, even if Einstein improve the way a viewing physics, he wouldn't have been able to developpe his theories if he hadn't mastered mathematics. Usualy greats intellectuals have a broad knowledge that give them a new way of seeing their specific subject. So in many ways both assertion are complementary.

Personaly I am a very curious person. For me all knowledges are good to fulfill my intellectual curiosity. Therefore I found it interesting to fly from one subject to another that to study one field that would allow me to become the best in a subject that I only few can understand. For this reason I believe that it is ""better"" to have broad knowledge. It is more social.

However our social environment and our society enhance expert. If you want to be hire by company, wathever you are doing, you need to be good at it. That the reason why school and university are providing student with a very precise knowledge. You can easily find cours of developpement economy or in  french Middle-Age litterature. 

Our culture is driven by experise. At any cost, you have to master at least one subject. In my view this attitude is dangerous to culture. Culture is diversity, therefore one shoud seek for a broad knowledge, rather than a specific subject."
6197,0,"Some people think that it is more important for students to understand ideaas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.Others do not think so. In my opinion, I prefer the first one because the goals of studing is to how to use the knowledge.

For high school and college students, it is important to understand the ideas of the courses. If you just can remerber some facts and  can not know the reasons, then you will not deep understand  the main purposes and some implied meading behind the facts. Usually, this is essential for studing the article or reserching some science experiments. For example, Iwhen you learn some history episode, the more you can learn background, the more understanding you learn the content.

In addition, you will be flexable to apply your knowledge to what you need if you understand  the course.forexample, in the exam, if the teachear give some questions on the exam paper different from the content in the class, but you still can deal with it if you really understand the content but not just depending your rememory. On the other hand, learning is for practising. When you grasp some knowledge and can use it to deal with problems , in this way you can be competent in the job market in the future.

Of course, learning facts is very nessessary for the students especially for the primary students . Young childern must learn some primary knowlege that is helpful to them .
To sum up,"
8005,0,"With the development of the society, more and more people started to pay attention to how to success and what  successful people usually do. Recently, the issue whether the successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well has been brought into focus. When it comes to this question, the majority people think the successful people can be successful because the new things give them a lot oppotunities. However, others regard doing what you do well as a better choice.
As far as I am concerned, the successful people like to do what they do well.

To begin with,successful people do what they do well will give them more chances to be successful. When you do something a lot, you will recognize it more details. You will know why it works like that, and how it works, so when you met some problems, you don't need to worry about it.  You can solve it yourself. And you can do it better than others. All of this will give you more oppotunities to success. One of my friends do the things what he is familiar with all the time, although he spent a lot time on it, he successful because of it. He does this better than others, the things he made is low price and hige quality. So a lot of people like to choose his product.

Aslo, successful  people like to do the things what they know how to do well because they will have less risks. Most of the people don't want to take more risks in today's world. The risks may give them much pressure, and may let them lost everything they have. However, by doing the things what they know how to do well will be safer and aslo can earn lots of money. There are many people try to do new thing, whereas most of them can't success and lose what they have before. So these examples tells us we should do something we know it well.

Although, there are many advantages of doing familiar things mentioned above, trying new things also has its own benifits.Nevertheless,Jundging from all the evidence offered, we aslo can draw a conclusion that successful people prefer to doing what they already know how to do well."
11688,0,"Enjoy Life at Every Age

All people in a society can not be happy with the conditions or lifestyles that they are living in. This may be based on the socio-economic conditions or spiritual reasons. There is common belief in public that, young people are enjoying their life rather that the older peole. This is totally incorrect, since these kind of generations can not be applied to every society.  The level of enjoying life is determined by the level fulfillment of wishes, not with the level of age.

To start with, we should look at the age groups and their lifestyles in the society. For instance countries like Germany has a high rate of old people. In contrast, countries like Turkey has a high level of young peole. But, it can not be said that that wish fulfllment of young people in Turkey is greater than Germany. The social and economic conditions may bring joy for the older people in an industrialized country. It is not surprising that older people from those countries are travelling around the world and having fun. It is obvious that, they are having the greatest time in their life, since they do not have any reason to worry about. They living peacefully and with lack of stress. In other words, they are enjoying life more than younger people.

To go one stage further, working young people should be considered. In deveolping countries and even in industrial countries people are forced to work at early ages. This is because of the financial requirements. They have to prove themselve in the society and start earning money. Otherwise, they can not stand in the against the hard rules ofthe capitalist economies. Ailtougt there are cases that young people are enjoying their life by going to clubs, bars, or spend most of their time on entertainment but somehow they have to start working and face with the truths of the wild world. In addition to this, most ofthe young people, who has been seen like having fun infact performing aroleplay. The latent tru inside is toatally different. 

To sum  up, when all the things above are taken into consideration, the generalization in a society that expresses the level of satisfaction. It is obvious that people are enjoying life at any age that is most suitable for them."
7678,0,"Taking risks and trying new things have in common one thing: they are scary or, at least, they are not as comfortable as doing always the same things. Yet, I am conviced that they are necessary in order to be successful.

Risking can be frightening - I will not deny it. However, if you do not risk, you miss important opportunities to improve your condition. Every decision in life, from everyday to once-in-a-lifetime ones, implies some risk. If you are not able to take risks, this means that you are not able to take challenging decisions, with the obvious results. 

Furthermore, in certain situations, taking a risk can make the difference between someone who just accepts what he or she has (but might regret what he or she has not) and someone who is really satisfied. Just think of a recently graduated student who receives a very interesting offer which requires moving to another country: should he stay home and try to find an average job or accept it? I am convinced he should accept it and leave straight away, otherwise he might simply regret it for the rest of his life.

On a less personal level, there are contests where trying new things is almost mandatory. This is the case for example of researchers: questioning the status quo, trying out different possible solutions is necessary in order to find out new things - and where would the world be wihtout new inventions? I cannot imagine a researcher who does not want to try new things.

For all these reasons, I am conviced that successful people are those who are not afraid of risking. People who just keep doing what they are good at just miss out opportunity - because that is what a change really is."
8388,0,"I would definetly disagree with the statement .
                I would surely go for a specialize in specific subject because as the person who would be specialising in that subject,He would be probably gaining a lot of things present deeper inside that subject,which will surely fill his zeal for the subject.A person should possess alot of interest for going in depth in subject knowledge.
                When ever he goes deeper into a subject,first of all he will have a new experience,that is he will go into some other world, which he haven't even dreamt about it,that experience can  only be felt and it is rather unexplainable,Even if he tries to explain about the experience that felt to the  peoplearound him,they will never even try to understand him,which makes him quite unique from others.
                Secondly,the confidence level which will be present inside him towards the subject will definetly increse to a level which can be just imaginable,So he will definetly gain a confidence due to which he can listen to any kind of doubts which arrises between other people around him and he can even make a try to clear those doubts,By which he can handle almost any different situation given to him in his life.
                Specializing in a subject denotes to the professional carrier due to which the employment oppurtunities may be high ,He may just use the subject which he got by specialising, utilize it for the growth of the mankind.As the technology is being increased day by day,by utilising the latest technology a new form of properties can be found out in any science oriented subjects .Even fame may also be added in the specialisation of the subject why because, by going deeper into the subject he will dicover the new things,that haven't been thought of,So fame will surely make him to work more on the subject (interest wise and financial wise) .
                Finally, a proverb is there which says that ""Don't sail in two boats"",with this, i can say that when ever we specialize in a subject ,it would definetly lead us to a prosperous carrier and total humanity will be surely gained by the knowledge which we acquired in a subject."
11293,0,"In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.  I disagree with this ides.  I will explain why I disagree with it providing two reasons.  These two reasons are a condition of car campanies and a condition of roads nowaday.

Most of car campanies are creating new types of cars.  Every time I watch TV, I see many now comercials about new type of cars that are introduced by various campanies.  On the street, I see many advertisements of cars are hung on the walls.  In Japan, which is my home country, the two biggest car campanies are Toyota and Honda.  Two days ago, I heard on the news that these two campanies are fighting each other and trying to make new car to attract customers' attentions.  If car campanies make new model of car, people will be attracted to it and want to get it.  If people buy new car, they will ride it.  Nobody will keep it in their car parking.  Of course, all of people will want to show it how cool their cars are by rideing them.  If 100 people bought new cars, there would be 100 cars in use.  After people buy new cars, they would sell their old cars.  These old cars would be sold by cheap price in the used car shop.  People who have not enough money to buy new car would buy these used cars, then more and more cars would be on the road.  By these reasons, I think that the condition of car campanies has been increasing the number of cars in use today.  

The second reason, which I suppose is a condition of roads.  New roads are made in everywhere and their qualities are quite good.  They are smooth and are connected to other roads.  Therefore, people are able to change their distination while they are riding car on the roads.  If they are on the way to their distination using train, they can't change their distination as immediately as they can by the road.  Even if they can change, they will have to buy new ticket to ride new train.  It will cause money problem.  In addition, roads are everywhere.  In Japan, roads are located even under the ocean.  Impressionable condition of the roads reduce the time to be spent to go to the distination and also save a lot of money.  These points make people want to by cars.

From these two reasons that I explain above, I think that there will be a lot of cars in us"
10280,0,"I agree this statment, because if they do noy have a risk.,they won't grow theriself. If they don't grow theriself, they won't success. If you do just what you know now, your skill for everything won't change forever. And to challege to other thing is to make success.
  I think that the successful people took a risk.If they don't take a risk, they don't succseed about everything. 
  In my case, I took a risk of luaguage. I'm studying abroad in Canada now and go to the high school same as Canadian. That was hard for me. I could not speak English very much and was afraid of speaking to Canadian and useing English in front fo Canadian. But I diecided myself to come here and study English. I realized again and I became to try to speak to everyone though they are  Canadian. Finally, I could make friends and got good relationship between my host family. And to try everything was changed my mind like kindly and more positive.
  Second, in my opinion, if somenody don't want to take a resk and challeange anything, they won't grow theriself. To grow yourself, you must do something for you. I guess that something include some risk. But if you do't grow, you can not be successed.Bucause, your mind is same as before you don't callenge anything.
  In japan, i did not take a risk and challenge to anything so i did not grow at all. But I came here i did growed a lot. Bucause I did challenge a lot and to grow myself. So i got a friends,  good relationship and confidence to everything.  
  Finally, I think to challenge is to make success. If you don't challeng, you don'y have anything even gad mark or result. You don't get anything and you don't successed. 
  For these three reason, I agree this statement; Successeful people had a risk for challenging."
9623,0,"Learning and understanding are a large part of  our culture. I totally agree with this statement because as far as I am concerned, I think that before to act, it is necessary to understand. However, there are several advantages for students to understand ideas and concepts  and advantages for them to learn facts.

	First of all, some students prefer understand ideas and concepts because for us if they understand the meaning of a word, they will be able to use it again.
To support of that view, I would like to give an example of my experience. I am currenty in a language school to learn English. It is very important  to understand the meaning of each word in order to use it. Fortunately, professors explain all meanings of a word because In English, a word can have several meanings.

	Second, for others students, learning facts is more important than understand ideas and concepts. Indeed, for us, if they learn facts, they will be able to use it again in their real life. For instance, I was in a law university and one of my major was Real Estate> In this class, we only learnt facts such as for example what are formalities to build a house or to obtain a loan. For me this class was the mot interesting and above all the less boring that to learn by heart some concepts and ideas.

	To summarize, I think that understanding and learning are both essential. Nevertheless, the point of view of students can be different about of what is the most important for us"
10396,0,"For decades advertisements have a very strong effect on consumers. All companies are using the power of the advertiesement.
   But when they are using this power, are they fair? I don't think so! However they always tell about the positive, the most charming parts of their products, not the efficiency of it for example. In advertisements the people only sees the better parts, even with exaguratted. The most typical example to this is ""call and buy"" products, which appears on tv all day long. There is a product called ""Body Shaper"" for example. In that advertisement you see women with a very good shaped body and men with full of muscles. The people who watches this advertisement begin to think that; they shaped their body with this great invention, there is no reason for me either to achieve. In that advertisement the firm also show some animations about the muscle groups which would get strengthened. All of these are made for to fool you actually. The people you see in that advertisement are always in body building centers. They even not used the device once in a lifetime, only for that advertisement. When you start to use that product you feel pain in your back and no positive effect to your body strength, you pack it up and put it into your closet. There are some magic knifes for example that cut everything. Every knife has a particular job to do! But when you buy these knifes you see that there is a little problem with them. They won't cut after a few tries. But in the advertisement the chief cuts anything he wants.
   Examples can be expanded, but the main point is that every firm try to pretend their products better than they are in real and when you start to use that product you see that it's features are exaguratted. Firms shouldn't do this but nobody can stop them."
8298,0,"In today's world, it is highly advantageous to know a wide spectrum of knowledge. Since the chances that you may switch into another field increase day by day. What's more, a Mr know-all seems to be welcomed everywhere.
In my eye, however, it is better to specialize in one specific subject rather than to splurge too much efforts on unrelated subjects that may have nothing to do with your future life.
Firstly, every human being's energy is limited. Believe it or not, even a genius like Einstein could only dabble in other fields than physics, How can an ordinary doing too much in a short lifetime?  Focused efforts do not pay off for everyone, not to mention scattered time and energy.
Secondly, to survive in this fullly competitive society and earn your bread in the rat race, you'd better  have your strenth. Specializing on one specific subject can make you an expert,  broad knowledge of many academic subjects may not most the time.
Thirdly, brought up by our country, we are all eager to do something for her in the future. But without a deep knowledge in one specific area, how can we contribute largely to her? Take my major, ocean-engineering as an example, without specialized devotion in the style and designing of ocean-structures, we can't  go any further in our future.
What's more,  there are too many things worth pondering over, if you are given the chance to pick some from an ocean of academic subjects, which ones are you going to selct? You may probably get  lost in the immense subjects, or achieve nothing wandering among these subjects.
What I have argued above is based on my own experience, but we can neither go far when being tightly enclosed to a single subject. It is better to have some know-how about your related subjects, but our major time and energy should go to one specific area.
""Roman was not build in a day"", so was the knowledge. Dedicate more  to your target, and you can achieve more."
7966,0,"""Young people enjoy life more than older people do."", is that kind of phrase ones can often hear in modern, western countries, where enjoyment seems to be one of lifes biggest goals. Wheather this is true or not it will all come down to the point of defining and measuring ""Joy"". But let me approach this matter step by step.
It might seem natural and obvious to believe in this simple sentence because of the physical and mental abilities of young people. They are healthy, strong, flexible and abitious to conquer the world, make inventions, found families and many more important faktors of life. But is this really a joy any time? They are often fight their hectic and fast environment and get quickly older, visible in burnouts, psychological problems, affection for drug usage and crime. I would agree that young people have an higher interest in their environment in general, but it does not say if this interest to create, explain and dominate is joyous or a need, meybee genetically predetermined.
How about older people? When we hear this we might think of those tied into bed, unable to eat and care for themselves. But if you think twice you can find a lot of older people, who are happy with a slower live. My grandparents still travel more foreign countries a year I could even afford. Others write books and give their experience to the younger generation. We should not be mislead by the idea of ""maximizing joy"" in terms of spending more money, doing more extrem activities and so on is always desireable.
To summarize it I might be allowed to refence to Kant, a German philosopher. More than 200 years ago he wrote, it is never possible to define a overwhelming good wich accounts for everybody but everybody shall have the right within certain borders to find his own satisfaction (quoted rater freely). Therefore I am tempted to say this question is to be answered indivually. Of course we can discuss it, but the answears tranferred into real politics will quickly show very unpleasing results I assume."
6797,0,"It needs people like Benjamin Franklin, who was risking his own life for the sake of science, when he used a parachute during a thunderstorm to study the characteristics of electricity, in order to enhance our technological but also philosophical understanding. There are countless examples of man in history who risked there own wealth or even there life to try out a 'new thing' in which they believed and put their faith. 
It is inherent to the human nature to strive for new knowledge and wisdom. But new knowlegde can only be gained by daring the step aside of the enlighted path and search in the darkness. Risk has to be accepted as a part of this search.
To become successful you need to distinguish yourself from the crowd and this also means to accept some risk. One possibilty to do so is by exploring new ways and, thereby, invent something new or develop new skills. Successful entrepreneurs, for example, are usually recognised as risk-taking people. Innovation is the result of their effort to become better and make things better. With their success the shape our economy and our society. It is people like Bill Gates who changed the world we are living in today; and he started in a small Garage, working on something people at that time might have called 'crazy' and 'useless'. He definetely tried a 'new thing' and that is wad made him very successful.
Another proof that success and risk-taking go together can be provided by the financial markets. It is taking the risk which pays off. But that does not necessarily mean that risk is uncontrollable. Information can be gained and used through personal effort to assess the quality of the risk. So to become successful it is also necessary to get informed, implying that one can not only do what he knows how to do well already but has to try 'new things'.
Acknowledging this, I have to agree with the given statement."
774,0,"Nowadays, life is much more fast-paced than in the past: with the long working hours and the many activities that one single person carries out, taking some time to help out in one's community does seem a rather difficult task. These factors, however, tend to be overlooked when analysing why people, in general, are much less devoted to their community: this debate usually singles out young people as being the most selfish group. One that does not get involved and where each individual fends for his own.In my opinion, this statement is too simplistic and I do not agree with it.
First of all,although we cannot deny that life is now much centered around individual goals than on community values, volunteering in third world countries has become a standard way for students to spend their gap year, helping out while at the same time gaining knowledge of another culture and possibly another language.In a natural catastrophe,such as an oil spill that ocurred a few years back, I was a witness to how hundreds of university students willingly took time to make the trip to the site and clean up for a few days, sleeping on the floor and with no retribution whatsoever. Some of them even gave up their final exams just to be there. 
Further on,in a world where consumistic values are the prime source of identity, many transnational social movements are making the difference, and these are mainly led by young adults who truly feel they should make a difference:we could argue that, therefore, the focus is not any more on the immediate community, the one we lived in, but a growing concern for the global community. 
If we are quick to judge the young's apparent apathy, we can miss out on the many activities that are carried out all in the name of solidarity: we have to look closely and see that all the political, economic and social changes have indeed affected the way people relate to their community, but not to its detriment, just to the adaptation of this realtionship in a more complex world."
3086,0,"In order to  sell a product the first thing you have to do is advertise it, to make it known by the people, otherwise they product won't be sold, doesn't matter if it is good or bad. In the next paragraphs I am going to explain why I consider advertisement make products seem much better than they actually are and why companies do this.

   First, we have to consider the subject of Advertisement as a branch or subdivision of Marketing, in other words Marketing uses Advertisement to promote the product or service the company trades. In order to make the product popular, the marketers, publicists and publicity companies have to make the product very attractive sometimes over highlighting the product's features and benefits. Sometimes they create multimillonaire campaigns to promote products that are not necessarilly  the best in the market. For example in Eastern Europe a couple of years ago, they make a very big promotional campaign for one car, the Dacia. The ads said that is was a cheap car, the ""car for the people"" they stated, that is was very economic, that have a traditional european design and that it will be the best deal for families and young people. What they didn't mention was that altough its nice exterior design, the interior was very poor and cheap, and even more serious, that car needed a lot of visits to the mechanic after the first 100.000 miles. As a result a lot of people was unsatisfied and agry with the company that told them that was the best option around.

   Furthemore, when we consider advertising to make products look good, we just have to watch the tv commercials, or the internet where companies promote their products in a very glamourous way sometimes. We can see beautiful models, actors or actresses talking about a product or service that is not really as good as it seems. For instance, recently a friend of mine was interested in  a computer he saw on the internet,  the design seemed very nice, with a wide screem and a lot of software installed. After a  few months the operating system stopped working well and that computer didn't come with the original system back up disks, so he have to pay a lot of money to get it fixed to the same company that sold it to him.

   As a conclusions, nowadays in the market we can find a very wide range of products that seem to be perfect and that last forever. The true is that is not always the case and we always have to try something before we buy it in order to verify what the seller promesses just to sell more units."
7264,0,"The statement at hand is a very dabatable one and may have readers split depending upon his or her views about the future.  A person who is pessimsitic about the future or not very updated with the latest development in technology may have his views split with a person who is updated with the latest news and technology advancements.

By looking from a pessimistic point of view a person may agree that with the growing demand of oil, not failing the mention the increasing oil prices one would suggest that the oil reserves would be over in few decades or the prices of oil would shoot up far too high for the common man to afford. Both of the assumptions lead the consequence of fewer cars being able to run on roads.

However being optimistic I would look at it from technological perspective where technological advancements could replace oil  by a commodity which is more abundant in nature ; water for example. Since Earth is covered with 3/4 's water and water is made up of oygen and hydrogen; it defintetly has the ingredients a futuristic fuel. Moreover I feel we could have lesser in another way i.e cars be replaced by hovercrafts which would reduce ground traffic by enabling one to travel through air. 

In my opinion the quantity of cars would not become less; as continous advancements in technology will definetly provide solutions to the existing fuel problems."
4747,0,"Some people say that currently young people serve for their communication. So, I re-asked them if in the past time young people did. I think that some old people who are angry with impolite young people prejudged them. Paritally I understand their angry but I never agree that young people do noting for their communication.

First, the school encourage their students to take part in serveral community serving activitis. Our country have been criticizing on the one way teaching. For long time, students have spent much time to prepare their exam of entrance for university or high school. I think adult in past time made that. But nowdays the situation different. For example, all the school take it mendatory to participate in the community service activity. We can't fail to see young children cleaning their neighborhood every Saturdays. Of course there is side effect of that mendatory activity. But I empasize their practice. We must easily despise their voluntarism.

Second, nowdays young people do variety activity besides service activity like cleaning. They have variety interet such as dance, singing. For example, a few day ago I watched the festival of adolcents in the culture center of town where I live in. I got impression from their fever and excellence. In the festival, beside resident of town many people like familis of paritcipating adolscents came to see their competition. It is not only for adolscents but also for all residents of our community.

In sum, I love nowdays my young people. They can make some mistake. It is because they are not much sophisticated. I have much learned, watching them do someting in order to serve for their   communitis. The saying ""Children is father of adult"" is going."
12060,0,"There are always debates on the relationship between the age of the human being and enjoying life. I believe in that young people enjoy life more than older people. I assert this concept in this essay by giving the reasons in the following way.

In the first place, young people have more phycial capacity than older people. As a matter of fact, the more you live, the more you are tired in the physical manner. To enjoy even more, there is need to be healthy, ie. powerful muscles, organs which are work properly, etc. How can you enjoy if you are sick or tired? When the life progresses, your probability to get illness increases by the ages. In this way, some familiar activities, such as sportive activities, going to the cinema, etc. which need physical effort to do cannot be possible to enjoy.

In the second place, the need for enjoying more is higher mental capacity. The tiredness and efficiency losts are not only in the one person`s health , in the mental capacity also. To solve a puzzle, what do you need really. Yes, mental capacity is important.  

To sum up, in one way or another, we need more physical and mental capacity to enjoy life more. Because of the aforementioned reasons, we need healthier bodies and clear mental structures to taste more from life. And it can be done in the young ages more. So enjoy the life more! As you can do in the early stages of your life."
6018,0,"Learining is a very disputable word. Few persons generally misjudge it with introduction, understanding or craming etc. But it is very necessary that what we learned should be same as that of what we understand.
It's very common among the students to learn the facts rather than to understand the ideas behind it. They always looking for short term goals usually their examination. But it creates a great problem when they get a applied question in the examination. Few questions are  based on uderstaning of concept. These types of question are usually not mention in the text books. If you donot uderstand the motto or theme of subject, it's very difficult to apply it in the current field, other fields or after a short time span. One will foreget the things just after few days or months. But if we evaluvate the subject fully, its a life long achivement. We can use the same concept in different streams or at any time.
For instance, if  an agriculturist  beleive in learning facts; may be he will able to acheive a good grades, but practically he will not able to apply his knowledge in his field as agriculture is an applied science. The understanding leads to development of creativity and if an agriculturist is not creative, he will not able to investigate the new techniques.
Similarly, if an engineering student learn the facts of the  principle of working of a maching rather than to understand it, he can only handle that particular type of machine and never think about a new discovery.On the other hand if got basic idea, he can renovate the maching according to the requirement of time.
Every field of study require application of your skills rather than to copy it, which can be only possible when the students  will understand the ideas rather than learning the facts. Today's time is for ideas holding persons which is entirely based on creativity; ultimately understanding."
421,0,"travelling became a very comon thing that people do for diffrent kinds of things like work, family, enjoyment, learning...and people do them in diffrent sort of ways they go with friends or just with family members or with a group of society...and somtimes they even include a guide, that usually accompanie them when they want more information about a monument or somthing they want to visit and other people use him just for guidness through out the country.

in my opinion travelling is an experience, an adventure, a knowledge. when i travel i like meeting new people from diffrent cultures, i like to learn from them, learn there language, see how think, how they live, what they eat, in general just living a diffrent life. if i m thinking of traveling with my friends all this passion i have about travelling wouldn't happen.we will be to busy taking care of each other.and when we have each other we wouldn't be looking for other things knowing that we get along better with our own invironment.

when i see new places monument, castles, historical evidence. i like enjoying them and triing to figure them out by my self i would like to take my time guessing what happened in this place, and then to clear up my story i would rather sit in my room and read about it and remember all those beautiful and peacful moment i had there.

so one day when someone asks me what have i seen in this word of discovery i would be abel to say that i discovered it my self and be abel to discribe it in my own opinion and not someone elses."
8437,0,"I,being a science student  completely disagree with the above statement.I have a couple of self experienced incidents to say this.A person is generally inhibited with some level of knowledge which he cannot cross over.Thus taking  one subject specialised would be more beneficiary to the candidate.                                                                                                I would like to quote a jug of water to support my theory.When a jug of water is placed upto its brim it will be useful for several others to quench thier thirst but when it is overflown then it gets wasted and would be not useful for anyone.In the same way knowledge gaining would be  useful for building up good careers but it becomes unworthy when one is not mastered in any of the subject he planned.                                                                                                                                      The proverb 'SLOW AND STEADY WINS THE RACE' can be reminded.THEREFORE IT IS BETTER TO GET SPECIALIZE IN ONE SPECIFIC SUBJECT.let us consider the world's greatest scientist SIR ISAAC NEWTON  for this.If he too would have concentrated on many subjects without making any thourough knowledge on anything then we would have lacked the world's famous LAWS OF GRAVITATIONAL FORCES.                                                              There may be exceptionalists who gain vast knowledge on various subjects but the scientific reason behind this is they possess a greater amount of grey matter in brain and are considered as super humans  like EINSTEIN.Here the fact is that one has to recognise one's own ability of  study and interest and fully justify thier choice.this comes only through wise thinking and seeking good advices from elders.   										I conclude the section that ONE HAS TO BE SELF WORTHY AND CHOOSE LESS,GAIN	 MORE should be the motto.May be one's study field is small  but it must be unique and contrast .It's not wise to say that only by getting specilized in many would make u creative but finally 'UR UNIQUENESS ' would place one in a better status in the society.									THANK YOU!"
3536,0,"Yes ,I agree that  the authors primafacy recommendation is militating .Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they know already how to do well.
   Firstly,successful people try to do new things and they want to innovate some thing for others.For instance i admire Dr.Adul kalam ajad . He is one of the great ,scintilllating and dynamic strongconsistancy person in India.he is one of the successful person .Actually he was a techer in a school.But his anxiety and strong determination makes him now a President of India.though he is a successful person  but he dont want to do what he already known
. He was great scientist in India.
   Secondly, the other example is Nelson mandela.He is a great leader in South Africa. he had imprisoned for twenty years .even though his experience made him as his dream strong and deterministic.at finally he can achieved the independence of his country.so he is my one of the great leader.at present he is working as a president position of U.N.O.even he is also a great succeessful person .But he never thinks that only doing what they alredy know how to well.
   Thirdly,Gandhiji is god for India country.By his only his efforts made now india is on at present position.His slogan is peace for all things all over the world.He is also a great succeessful person thst ever known.
    so according to my view succeessful makes people and thinks innovatively.so try to think positive dont think negative.go ahead and for u r dreams.jai hind."
3685,0,"In every summer, A lot of people go Paris and visit many museums, and some of them just give a short look at every paints and sculptures. It's easier to travel in a group then travel by alone. It's ,however, in doubt if this is the best way. Traveling in a group led by a tour guide is not the best way to travel. The rationale behind this is that this kind of travel will never satisfy personal interests and it donsen't have flexibility in schedule.
      The first reason why traveling by oneself is good is that a person can go and see what they want. Unlike to touring in group, an individual can show specific interest on art or customs. To illustrate, a newspaper article shows that a culture of an country has a lot of things that needs about a year just to see what there is. Thus, It's ridiculous to going through not participating on certain parts of an culture.
      Secondly, taking a travel with nobody else allowes the flexibility in schedule. Since it's hard to know of a region without visiting the place, a person may feel like to change the time they spent on certain city or country rather than going other place. According to an survey done in the airport, visitors who haven't come to a country before changed there perceptions they had before in many ways. In this sence, traveling alone gives benefits to understand the country more deeply by giving changes to a plan.
      To conclude, it is good to travel individually because seeing what they really want to see on a trip is important and allowes giving change in plan, even though there are good features of group traveling like time saving and being with a person who can speak languages foreign to a person. If you are planning to join in a group, think once again if I'm giving up the opportunities to broaden my sight for a little convinience"
2385,0,"I disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do and there are three main reasons why I think so. 
	First of all, there are more tasks given to young people than to old people. For example, young people have to study in order to go to school and get a good mark at class. They also have to work to make money or to be experienced enough to get a better job. Sometimes they are too busy to do something they really want. But older people have done all the tasks given to them. All they have to do is to receive a reward and appreciation for their hard work and achievement. 
	Secondly, old people are wise enough to realize what pleases them. In other words, they enjoy their lives whereas young people often get stressed out from living. Old people have more experiences and clues about what life and they know how to behave when they face a challenge. Probably the reason why young people think they are struggling through their lives is that they have less experiences than older people and panic whenver they find their lives difficult. Old people know how to enjoy their lives, hoping young people will soon realize what they figured out when they were young. 
	Thirdly, and more importantly maybe, old people are richier than young people. They have worked hard and have earned money as a result. They can spend money on whatever they want. They can buy a fancy car, they can make a beautiful garden, and they can even give their money to their children if they want to. 
	Everyone wants to enjoy life and the only difference is the ways of enjoying life. People cannot assume that old people cannot enjoy life only because they are old and boring. Obviously, there are many things for young people to learn from older people. They need to learn how to work hard, how to achieve their goals, and how to enjoy life. However, most of these questions will be answered completely as they actually get aged."
5141,0,"Today, many students seem to choose to study more than one major in the university for certain purposes. To know more than one subject or major can be a benefit for people, but I believe that to specialize in one specific field is a better choice because in the long run, more knowledge of diverse subjects will be beneficial to the future career. In addition, it encourages people to think more creatively.

To begin with, general knowledge on every aspect of academic subjects is essential to perform a job of higher position and lead people in the future. To be sure, special skills and knowledge help people to get better jobs and give them more ability to achieve what they want in work place or in academic field. However, as people go up to the superior position, or to take more responsibility, they will have to see the whole forest, not a single tree. That means, without general knowledge in every aspect that is related to the entire goal or process, you will likely to get lost in how to manage and lead other people in the respective field. In this sense, people need to broaden thier view and this can be done by studying many academic subjects.

Furthermore, with their broad knowledge of many academic subjects, people are able to develop their potential creative-thinking ability. It is widely know that creativeness evolves from various academic backgrounds. For example, I have a cousin who studies a lot of subjects in the university. She is majoring in english literature, but she also studies on other subjects such as music, physics, and golf. This made her think and act creatively. She won the most innovative essay of the university twice and a lot of professor say that her problem-solving way is always fresh and new. This shows that many academic knowledge encourages the creativeness.

In summary, to have specialized and professional knowledge on a certain subject may a benefit to people, but because general information will help people in the future and it generates creativity, I agree to have broad knowledge."
3422,0,"I think this is the main porpuse of the advertisements, make to believe people to adquiere their products because  they are very useful, attractive or is going to solve most of the problems that are making you mad at the moment.

But the real deal here, is that advertisements are a brain washer for everyone that sees them. In countries of the first world most of them, are very persuasive and make you buy that product. They use all the tools and all the media to get thru  your eyes.
The ads in the tv, are so colorful and so vivid that you realy like them and al last you finish buying what the ads was promotionig.

The technology has become a real advantage for the human kind, and the big corporations use this,  in their big companies  to make this advertisements. Everybody can see this on  tv,  hear then in the radio, they even stick big stickers in the buses, pul masive pictures in the big avenues, in the top of the buildings. In the bathroom you can do 2 things at the same time, while somene is doing they natural physiological needs the Marketing is attacking you in the posters or even in the small tv screens tagged in the walls.

Getting out of  the point just bit  I believe the advertisements are a waesting of money, which only the big companies get benefits and none people that really need it
I know that probably saying that sounds hilarious but it should be  a law againt this masive weasting of money, we have to end the domination of this companies  who  ruled this world.
Is impossible that it happend but imagine  if they save this quantity of money and with it give it to the persons who need it for real. They will help to build up  a better world with better opportunities for every one."
3142,0,"I'm agree with this statement because in the future there would be new types of transportation. I also think this because the the oil someday will finish, and the oil will be only for the rich. But let me explain my reasons point by point.

The first point and the main one for me, is that cars are not very safety, even nowadays with the new intelligent cars.
Only in my country there are 45.000 deaths each year. This is a big number of deaths, so thats why I think there are a lot of people working in new types of transportation. And I imagine you asking your self why does this guy know that information, I know this information because in Spain many families suffer the consecuences of this types of accidents.

Another important point is that the oil someday will finish, but I think we don't have to wait until that day, I say this because in Europe the price of the oil is very very expensive,  many people can't pay it. As I read the other day in a prestigious newspaper there are a lot of companies working in alternative types of oil. This is something that I don't know too much,so let keep it for the scientists.

Finally I wanna express my conclusion, and it's that one of the gratest inventions of the human bean in a few years will finish. I don't want to look like a dramatic person but the only thing that cars give us are problems, for example many people suffer stress because the traffic jams. But on the other hand cars also help us now the trips are more shorter than before, but this is only a little advantege. There are more disadvanteges."
318,0,"I agree with the statement but only partially. Education is termed as the path to overall development of a person and since childhood people are trained in a variety of topics and after a certain age when they can decide for thmselves the person can chose a topic or subject of his liking and specialize in it

    At the basic childhood level the school circulum  include all the knowledge rquired for the child to view the world in the normal sense.Subjects such as social and natural Sciences tell the everyday movements of the earth its location and how and why of many aspects of nature which interest the child at that age.

     At high school level the subjects are dealt in detail and a fewer subjects are dealt at that stage so that the in depth knowledge of a few selective subjects is stressed .This leads to the development of a personality and the young adult now can have a subject of his liking at undergraduate level.The subjects learnt so far will also assist the person his or her chosen field of specilisation FOR EXAMPLE  the use of concept of physics like gravity and momements of earth and other objects in space in the  field of rocket science and design engineering.

    At undergrauate level of education the person gets to decide about a specific subject and specilize it at his graduate and doctrate level of education if he choses to do so.FOR EXAMPLE ,consider the case of engineering at undergraduate level an electronics engineer can convert into a computer and electronics engineer at his graduate level using his computer knowledge on his electronic basics.

 In conclusion , i have to say that although specific knowledge of an academic subject is important the need for knowledge on a variety of subjects is all the more important to  attain an over all developed personality for a person.Particularly in this day and age when a knowledge of variety of topics is needed to survive in  this technologically submerged  world."
1600,0,"agree.i completely agree with the statement. most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.the statement can be applied to almost any field.
                         firstly,the facts presented in the ads are not always correct. these generally are not tested or not verified.say, at one time an ad in asian country  about the heat pumps said that the device can output two units of heat energy when it takes only one input of electrical energy.now this challenges the very law of conservation of energy.but it doesnt tell about an additional unit of heat energy the device takes from surroundings.
                        so on the part of the consumer it becomes really difficult to believe such facts.
                        secondly , it sometimes happen the statistical results shown about a product are not taken considering all possible situations. say for example the windows beta version ad said that it can work longer . but in actual working the software crashed after working continuously  for forty-eight hours.one obvious possible reason is that it was never tested in such conditions. so in ad it looked very efficient , much more than it actually was.
                          thirdly , sometimes the ads make comparisons with the other products of same category.in such comparisons they highlight those parameters which are good in their product as compared to the other product. but rarely  they compare all the parameters including those in which their product is inferior in performance to the other company's product.they never show the actual tradeoffs between the positives and negatives of the product.
so the comparisons can be misleading very often to the consumer.
                         lastly, very few ads show the potential harm a product can cause to a human or entity using it  over long periods of time.for example a computer monitor manufacturing company very rarely  focuses on the part that continuous exposure to the screen can strain the eyes which can have serious medical problems in long run. so the consumer never gets to know about these problems thinking that the product is efficient and doesnt even strain the eyes.rarely such ads suggests to  use anti-glare  protective screens.
                       by using the above stated supporting reasons and approriate examples most advertisements make product seem much better in performance and efficiency than they really are."
3988,0,"I agree  with the statement that young people enjoy life more than the older people do. This is like this. Lot of youngr people are very enthusiastic about their young life to explore the new things so as to enjoy up to the maximum extent where as the older people who have experinced almost all the things in their life tend to relax in their older ages.

	Now, young people who are new to the world with new intentions like to spend their time in enjoying the life as much as possible like doing many things, such as going to the theaters to watch films and pubs every weekends to have fun, can play a lot of games together and even participate in high level tournaments, can have sex, can enjoy their university life as a student and many. Many of these things can also be enjoyed by the older people even but they are bored of doing them as they did a lot in their young life.  

             Playing sports must need a lot of strength and energy which older people lack. Having a  lot of parties with friends in young life is the other important thing to be considered which the older people may find it difficult to do as often as young people do and they also think that thay are a waste of money. To some extent even older people who are still interested will enjoy attending the parties and pubs. 

	 One more important thing is the student life, which will not be repeated again. Students enjoy a lot in the universities in many aspects such as sports, research and even in some other co-curricular activities. Older people cannot definately do that again, but can enjoy as a professor which is quite different from the student life. Students can experience the newer generatiions of life that has been changing gradually and they increase their expectations that suits the newer generations.
  
	As the younger people having more expectations on life and more resources than the older people had, I can strongly conclude that young people will definately enjoy more than the older people do."
6074,0,"it is a difficult question because i think that every aspectof study is important for students.
 i am not agree in total with the statment that says that is better for students to undestand ideas and concepts than to learn fact, because i think they have the same importans in a development of young people.
in general i think that it is  important for students to understand ideas and concepts because it is only with this passage that they can have theirs  opinions and ideas, but at the same time it is also important to learn facts because with the knoledge of  process of the facts people can do what it was be right in the past and do not what was dangerous or wrong.
for example i thaink that the concept of peace can be better undersand if you know history, in fact with that matter you understand that war gives people only poverty, difficulties and not good things. i think that it is easy to understand concepts if you have a real invironment in some facts.
the ideas and concepts, with the study and learning of facts  give us a strong base of our education and it is important for a good future improuvment .
finally i think that both of this aspects are important for a good development of young people, so students have to undestand ideas and concepts"
7378,0,"Experiencing the convinience of the car, we cannot keep cars away from our society. Most citizens living in advanced society use cars almost everyday. Many parents drive students  to school every morning, and many wives send her husbands to their companies. In this environment is it true that in twenty tears, there will be fewer cars in use than there are todat?
     I disagree with the statemet that there will be fewer cars in use that there are today because there are still lots of people who will use cars in 20 years.
          What accelerate the nuber of cars within 20 years? Now, there are still lots of people who do not have the licence of cars, especally in developing country which has billions of population but whose people do not affort that now. However within 20 years, they seem to develop more than now. If Chinese people, more than12 billions, will become affluent, the number of cars is absolutely increasing. No one can deny this fact. Since the area of China is extraordinary large, the need of car should be high. Postulated that the one-third of Chinese will get a car, the number is 4 billions!! Ofcouse the country that have possibility to increase the number of cars is not only China. India, Kenia, Levanon, or Cuba have great possibility. Therefore, the number of cars must be increased with the development of those countries.
             Having said that there are people who insist that the nubmer of cars will decline in twenty years. However they tend to ignore the possible number of people who use cars in the future. Therfore their idea should be disimissed an inapproproate.
             I believe that the nubmer of cars will radically increase becase there are many people who know the convinience of cars in the future especially in developing countries."
9368,0,"I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than learning facts.
Learning facts is just a metter of remembering details. 
When knowing a fact is required, one can always go and check himself on a book. Lots of book have been written with that purpouse and there are a lot of written materials which can be useful in order to check a date or a name or whatever. 
The hardest thing is understanding the reasons why a certain fact has occured, the ideas that have brought to a specific event, the concept that lays under a certain episode.
I think that the fondamental issue is to teach the students to become confident with this process. 
For example, once that a student is tought to understand and recognize the causes that have brought to the second world war, details about when where who and what can be left to several information that can be found in books. 
On papers and other materials it is possiple to find a lot of informations about the mere facts and every time it is needed, one can go and check.
Students should be rather tought how to use these informations properly.  Ideas and concepts provide a frame in which it is then possible to orientate themselves, in order to give sense to things which has happened in the past, which occur in the present time or which could happen in the future. We have to remenber that past can explain the present and somehow foretell the future as well.
If students learn how to collect ides and concepts from facts, they are then able to give a place to mere facts.
Well, I cannot denye that knowing facts and details do make sense itself and somehow it is also important for knowledge. However I think that is not the primary thing. 
First of all ideas and concepts are worthy to be understood, then details come. 
So, in conclusion, I would like to outline again that understanding ideas and concepts is more important then learning facts."
7983,0,"It is widely said that young people do not consider their communities and tend to do whatever they want to without thinking how people are annoyed by them. If you watch some programs for middle ages on television, you may hear this kind of comments frequently. However, I disagree with the opinion. Young people, especially  univer sity students have enough time and, in fact, help thier communities. University students are encouraged to help thier communities in and out of classes.

     First of all, university students tend to have much more time to use thier time for helping thier communities. It may be true that young people like highschool students do not have much time to use freely because of the entrance examination of universities. In some societies, especially in Korea and Japan, young people are stressed to go to better universities and be employed by walthy companies. However, students in universities less worry about examinations any more though, ofcourse, there still be term examinations.  

    Second of all, some universities even encourage students to help thier communities. In fact, some universities have service learning courses which let students to do volunteer work and learn its importance and difficulties. Some students may prefer to go to work for communities which is far from their own, the others do for their own, which is much easier than going to futher areas.

     Finally, some students do help thier communities as an off campus activity. talking about my own experience, I was a member of the musical club which held mussicals or other thiatrical perfomances for small children and elder people at kindergartens and community centers as volunteers. The off campus activities cannot be limited on thaeatrical performaces but be varied. Students can enjoy thier activities and, at the same time, help thier communities.

     University students have enough time than others and do help thier communities in class and also out of class as activities. In conclusion, I further disagree with the opinion that young people do not help people because of  no time to do."
7717,0,"Yes I totally agree with the above statement.Because we should not learn the subject but we should understand the ideas or concepts or anything related to the subject.This plays a vital role in the educational skills and improve our learning attitude.
                                        If we are very poor at these things we can't  improve in our subject and we can't do better things related to the subject.For example creating new things will always be possible only when we have good knowledge about our subjects and if we start learning everything from our childhood we can't grow more relating in the particular field and hence if we start understanding concepts from the childhood then we can contribute alot to our fields like by doing Phd's., and then starting independent research areas and start creating in our own way will finally leads to good consequences.
                                      So everybody should be guided properly from their childhood and have a proper skills in learning things or facts.Ofcourse childhood play a very crucial role in everybodies life and hence parents should take care of their children properly and guide them properly in their education,in order to become good citizens in their nation.
                                     If students wish to contribute alot in their fields then they should concentrate to grasp the subject and potray it in a good way.This ideas will probably come true for those people who are really good at their educational background and learning skills.That's why everybody should learn how to apply skills in their career and they should interact with teachers and students to improve alot.If they start interacting they cancome to about their faults and they can correct them and adapt some good skills from their friends and teachers.So communication plays a vital role in everybodies lifes.
                               So students should maintain good habits inorder to acheive alot in their lifes and hence to contribute alot to their fields.Good learning skills are the only means to get suceed in day to day competitive world and fast life.Parents,teachers,friends and good habits are the primary things that affect student's lifes.Depending on this everything is inter-connected and hence good family background always play an important role in children's educaton.That's why ,elder should always behave properly and should think alot before they do ."
3608,0,"It is difficult  to become an expert in one specific subject without a good knowledge in other different subjects, but it is unproductive and unuseful towards society to have a general knowledge but not the possibility to get a specific role.
Attending the architectural university I have realised how many other disciplines this subject  can refer to, history, geography, medicine, astronomy, maths, physic, chemistry...and many more. So my profession will be one and well defined, but it will be the result of differents studies. 
In conlusion I disagree with the statement proposed, but I disagree even with its opposite, I think the truth is to be found into the middle."
8440,0,"Advertisements are designed to sell a product, and to that end they can go the extra mile that might just push a customer to buy it... this can sometimes mean that an advertising company will resort to sensationalist announcements that could fall into the category of miraculous in regards to what the product can do for the consumer, and sometimes it merely results in an extensive and colorful use of human languages.

In the case of those advertisers that would aim for exagerating the effects their product will have on their consumers, a great deal of colorful metaphors and even lies might used. A diamond ring could miraculously make the consumer look younger and more successful than they really are while in reality it all depends on the consumer's ability to ""dress for the occasion"". A dietary product might reduce your waistline to that of the skeletal model you see in a magazine or that of an actress in a movie, when in reality you would probably have to have a balanced diet and - more often than not - an exercise regimen.

Where using languages colorfully is concerned, we can often observe skilled writers with an ample vocabulary available to them as a mental arsenal developing pieces of literary art that charm the consumer. This is by far the preferred method as its intention is not to propagandize or sensationalize (as would be the case of the first case), but to use language in a lyrically enticing form that catches the roll of a tongue or that particular inflection that might season a simple phrase to the point of perfection in the ear of the beholder.

In the end both cases do in fact make a product usually seem much better than it is. In rare cases will a product satisfy the consumer as much as a well written piece of literature covering the product. It's my belief that the aim should always be for the product to be exceeded by its actual value or effectiveness... however, it should never be at the expense of the veritable truths of the product.

After all, creating fiction regarding a product could lead the consumers to driving a lawsuit against the company responsible for its development as well as the advertisers... We live now in a world where the public demands quality... even though it seeks fantasies."
8234,0,"Knowladge is very important issue that people should have but how to learn is most important part of the knowladge. In some countries like Turkey, people are forced to learn to fact rather than understand the ideas and concept. I strongly belive that understanding ideas and concepts is more important to keep your knowladge widely and long time.
 Students usually have a problem with little information in one subject. To have a large information about one specific topic, students should learn how to relate the informations about they heard and read. For instanse, two group of students are learning something about the animal names. In one of the these groups, students learn facts and memorise that information. The second groups are learning where these names comes from and the main points of this topic. Some time later, if you ask a question about unfamiliar name of animal, first group of people can not explain the topic while the others have some information about the question.

Secondly, the main problem in learning is forgeting the information that is learned before. This big problem's only solution is understanding the main points and ideas. According to the my teacher the most important point in learning is forgeting the information because of not learning the ideas and concepts. Student can easily learn and memorise the facts, but this knowladge doesn't take too much time. The major point is that if you learn how the topics are related and where that information comes from, it can make sense in your brain. After long time passes  you will still remember a little information about the subject.

As a conclusion, people's learnning styles tale really substantinal role in keeping the information widely and long time and as I said before the best solution is understanding ideas and concept. Time is getting knowladge and using this knowladge in your work. At this point people may know the topic they studied on , but they drammatiacly don't know how they use this information."
6184,0,"In now a days  the young people are not give enough time to helping their communities.yes i agree with this.because the main point is they have no intrest helping others.some young people are  are giving enough time for helping their communities.because they are intreested in that.but in this days the young people  intrested to go for a cinema whereas to help for the oyhers.they are spending more time and more money on the joyfull  entertinements.
                   but whereas in my opinion this is not true because,me and my friends are having enough time to halp for my communities.we spend time for that when we are free.so that in now a days the young people are preferred to enjoy with their friends,familys and with others than to help for the communities.the young people should hel for the community.because it is very benificial for communitt and society.
                              The main idea  is f we help for the community,by seeing us  our yonger friends or any one,they may try to help for the community.so that this will be increased by seeing one onther.at last it suppors the community.the helping for the community is main idea of me.because in now adays  no one is preffering to help others .because every one is having their own problems and every one is having a littele bit selfishness.so that they cant help for the community.the young people in now a days are preferrring to enjoy than to help for the community.if the young people will hwlp to yhe community the community will become good.the helping nature of the people should grow frm the childhood only.because if that grows from childwood they can help after that also.if it no grows it is immpossible to help in the young age.the young in this days are very joy full persons.so that they cant help for the other people.
                                      young people in nowadays do not enough to help for the communities.because the work pressure on them is very high,and some young students have no time to help the communities because of their studies pressure on them.these are the main reasons why the young people are helping or not helping for the communities.some people young people may help by words not by  money. i think the words are very helpfull for development of the community.so the young people should help for their communities hen they have time.if every younger do ths the community will become good.and it is usefull for future community development.i my opinion every young people is not helping their communities,if they dcided to help their communities the community become good.and by seeing them the otheryounger may try to help others.so the younger should help for their communities."
3612,0,"I argee with the point that young people nowadays do not give enough to helping their communities.

With the development of technologies, more and more funny products are coming into exsitence and entering peoples' daily life. So it is not surprising to find that young people would spend hours on PC games alone, instead of taking care of or talking to some old people in hospital.

Take computer as an example. A survey shows that global computer selling is contuniously growing, and so with the demand. And some teenagers do claim that computer is their best friend. With computers, they are able to chat with oversea friends, watching latest hot movies, or surfing on the internet. Since the time in a day is 24 hours, which is eaqul to every one, they of course do not have more time left to help their communities.

By contrast, teenagers in the old days did not have such kind of entertainment. Therefore, it was common for them to visit and help others' families in their community.

Moreover, freedom resolution started in California of United States in the 1960s showed a wrong example to young people. Instead of having a steady belief in God in mind, more and more people choose to believe nothing, which has already proved by a report on European citizens. It is indeed correct that the nature of human beings is to help each other, but having some belief will enhance your feeling to giving a hand. So lacking belief has surely a negative impact of those young people nowadays.

To sum up, I argue that too many kinds of entertainments and lack of belief lead to the fact the young people are not giving enough time to helping their communities. But I not saying that they are more selfish than before, rendering that there are just more aspects of life to pay attention to. In order to make some changes to this situation, I would advise parents to spend more time on their children and show them some positive examples."
1606,0,"Yes, I totally agree with this statement saying that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.  It is a shame that being a consumer is getting harder  because there are too many advertisements present their products in the most attractive ways.  

I think the reason is that there are many companies and manufactures out there making the same type of products.  Therefore, they all have spend a great amount of money on advertising so they can compete with each other and survive.  And due to the advanced technologies those advertisement agencies use, almost every product they present looks like the best on the market.  But very often, consumers don't really get what they expected after purchasing the product by just looking at their ads.

For example, few weeks ago I saw a digital camera ad on FRY's Electronics that was offering a great discount on this featuring model.  It the picture, the camera got a great metalic texture and looked very well built.  Although I owned a professional digital SLR camera (by CANON) for a while, I wanted soemthing inexpensive, small, and easier to carry around in the campus.  I purchased the camera without doing some research online or trying it in the store.  When I took it home, I realized its body was not metal but some light; cheap plastic.  The fully charged battery died with in just 30-40 minutes of photo shooting after trying it.  I finally got frustrated and decided to return it.  

The return line was very long and the guy behind me was returning the same camera too due to the same reason.  We talked for more than 30 minutes while waiting and we reached a conclusion that never purchase something just based on the ad or picture.

From now on, I do studies online or read some consumer reviews before I purchase.  Even the old saying goes ""A picture worths more than a thouthand words"", it doesn't apply on all products we see on advertisements nowadays."
1685,0,"People, especially common people, often discuss whether it is necessary to try new things and take risks rather than only doning what they already know how  to do well.  But I strongly believe that succssful people try to new things and undergo risks. If it were not for taking harships and trying new things, they have no opportunit to win other competitiors.

 Successful people generally more bold and painstaking than those who do not. As everyone know, this is not the only way of succeeding in doing, but this is one of the most effecitive way of succeding. In addition, it can positively contribute to find new ones that gives people a lot of confidence. Let's say that a scientist try to reasearch new things, if he is just the man who just mix other theories that already every people knows. He would never be successful in his filed. If he tried to find new things and take harship, he would succeed. 

 Successful people also think different way in every time. I understand that too much attention paid to new things is negative becasuse it may cause much more cost to do and sweep memebers along, sometimes to the detriment of their original work. But the advantages of tinking creatively eclipse the disadvantages. For example, people who always think different for winning in the market econnomy can find the fraction between many products. So he can beat other competitiors. As everyone knows people cannot work to its best ability when there is not new one that enable company to be vigorous as well as company to win in economy. 
 
 Taking all of things into account, there is no doubt in my mind that if you want to successful people or to win in some fields, you should be not doing what you know how to do well but doing more courageable, painstaking and creative."
2994,0,"I partially agree with the statement that "" young people enjoy life more than older people do"".

    Being young genereally means that you are single and dont have much responsibilities on your shoulders.Young people show great interest to experiment with various options they are given.They show enthusiasm with lots of energy.
      Older people also enjoy their life but in other ways.These ways are very different from that of the young people.They enjoy their work, home,children, and if they are retired from their jobs,they enjoy each and every moment as they spent their entire lives earning, taking care and doing their responsibilities.
However, being ready to experiment sometimes could be very dangerous.Young people in a mood of being too enthusiastic to do new things, may fall prey to drugs and other illegal activities.
     Having no responsibilties makes them a kind of free bird which can make young people reckless in the work they do and also be harsh and insensitive towards fellow beings.Sometimes having no responsibitly makes young people not to take things seriously about their personal and preofessional matters, which eventually leads to depression and sometimes life threatening.
       Older people due to their age, failing health and other reasons may not be that optimistic about going and doing an outdoor activity.
      Most of the old people love to go to museums or go to a picnic with their families or play golf.Young people usually prefer to go to pubs,trekking and some adventurous games and places.They prefer activities which are risky and also challenging.
  However, I feel that it is all in one's heart , what you feel about yourself , what you want and what you can do.Because your age is what your heart feels."
10524,0,"I strongly agree to this statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. There are two reasons why i believe that the statement is correct. Young people nowadays do not have much free time and do not have time to think about their surroundings, and they also tend to be extremely lazy and are not willing to help for their communities.
These days it seems to be that young people have a very tight schedule. Most teenagers have school till the evening, and some may even have extra curricular activities or part time jobs to earn some pocket money. Unlike before, young people are very independent and uses time wisely which would benefit them in any possible ways. Since they have a tight schedule and do not have other spare times other than thinking about themselves, they do not give enough time to helping their communities.
In addition to their tight schedules, young people nowadays are extremely lazy. This may be because of the fast developing techonologies, such as use of computers, and easy access of transportations to places. Teenagers are especially lazy when it comes to solving problems. They believe that they have better things to do than helping their communities, and avoid volunteer works. However, problems may change once money comes into an issue. Young people nowadays love money, and they would most likely do anything which involves earning money. If the government makes this community help as some sort of a part time job, young people may find some interests in helping.
Today, young people are much more independent than they were before, and are extremely self centered. I believe that this problem should deffinately change as soon as possible. In this way, young people would learn that helping others is an important aspect in their lives."
2524,0,"The issue over having broad knowledge over the specific knowleadge according to me would depend on the level of education and general to specific is the right hierrarchy .
If the person is at the undergradulate level, it would be wiser and more beneficial for his rest of the life to take a broder knowledge than just in specific feild. For insatnce If s/he has taken admission into general medical science then person will get to learn all possible subjects such as paediatric, or  neurology or say ENT, then once he get exposure, he can actually decide in which area he more inclines to, then accordingly s/he can major into any of the subject. But if he doesnt get exposure to all these how wil s/he decide which is his aea of interest. Person can keep studying or doing research in his rest of life if he is really make decision of his area of interest, which is possible only after taking general knowlege then specififying to a certain knowledge. Just imposing studying will never make the person reach the the higest goel.
In addition to that if everyone for that matter gets chance to know  their area of interest in other word get specific knowledge their feild will be of great help to society since they will be contributing lot in inventing things thereby helping to solve the problems which are yeat be digged.
Following general o specific pattern would also means taking or sharing knowledge from one feild to another feild. For example if somebody has taken few subjects in electronics and few in audiology, and later they find that audiology is thier area in which they want the have indepth knowlwdge. But in that felid implemening principles of electronics may lead some new discovery, which in any case wouls be impossible if person has knowleadge in onw area only.
Bringing one field knowlwdge to other feild can make the person more thouhtful, imaginative, and more inventive. 
There are other adavantages too for a person from general to specific knowleadge, such as he can upgrade his knowlwdge as and when he feel if he has general orientation to it. Also general to specific will lead to attend different classes, interaction with different speciality of professor and making frinds with different area of interest, who may be helpful in future if you need any assisatnce when you are trying to get combine two or more feilds and get rid of many social problems.One exapmple of this kind is twchnology of cochlear implant for hearing disables people, it took years for deaf person to speak, socilaise like anyother talking child. This was possible due to implant, which not a just contribution of one feild but knowlwdge sharded from eletronics, computronics, audiologist, surgeon, speech pathologist. If you want to have help from all these different faculty and really create wonder like cochlear implant you must have general to specific approach in studies."
11102,0,"I agree that successful people try new things more important.
I think someone Who have desire about success are not satisfied one thing. they seek another things, that is more attractive things.

  Successful people have an endless energy about doing something.
So, they do not like a safety position. They think that staying in a comfortable situation is dead, which makes them study many things.
For example, scientists discover many things. Even though they earned much money from one project, they do not enyoy the money.They get courage about doing something and proceed forward. 
They  find new things every day. 
I think someone who have power about things are received from God. They are borned with the nature.
I like Edison because he has not been edcated , but he did not stop studying something. As a result, he became the father of science.

482,0,"I agree that most advertisements make goods seem much better than they really are. Advertisements are important. However, the davertisement can be make products useless because people is able to misunderstand on advertisement.

      First, most advertisement purpose to sell the products. so, many 
company always think about customer and customing how much goods can be sole out to a lot of people. For example, if people or consumer are watching advertisements on TV or magazine, people feel attracting the product because purpose ofcompany owner or advertisements owner sell much better than they relly making a lot of products. Morover, if a lot of people don't watching advertisement on TV or magazine, many people do not buy products.


    Second, most advertisement make to competition many people.
For instance, if someone buy a car, someone say other people or other people ask for someone where the car is buying. Sometimes,
Buyer told other people that i wish to buy a car because i watching Tv. He  will proud his car because advertisement said about car is wonderful.


conclusiony, i agree that most advertisement make products seem much better than they ."
5111,0,"I do agree with the statement 'Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well'. By doing so, they also bring about a change in the way of how things carry go on conventionally.

We do have well renowed people in each field say  cricket, art or music who have given it a new definition by trying out things differently. Let us consider the example of 'Abraham Lincoln'. 
During  those days, when blacks were discrimated.It was he who fought against it by taking numerous risks and stood for them and became one of the most famous presidents who ruled America.

We do have several business who have started their career with hardly a few penny in their pockets  and did eventually turn out to be  of the most successful and richest people.By doing so, they do increase the economic growth of the country by giving new ideas but also do stand as a paragon for others to follow their footsteps.

Apart from the business field, we can also consider great personalities who have renounced their life for the sake of humanity.For example, let us consider the example of  Mother Theresa. She could have always let her own life in luxury and peace rather than spending her entire life for a different country and leading an austure life. She has taken various pains in helping out the needful.She has also contributed so much to the society by building many santoriums and homes for the poor and old aged people."
566,0,"For some reasons we can think that young people enjoy more life than older people do. At first sight we can state this because it is clear that it is easier to be young, in good health with future perspectives than to be old, to suffer and to count the years before dying. Besides, parents often say to chidren that they are lucky. I can't deny that be old is not a very funny thing over all for the body, for the health but on the other side it implies that you have lived a lot of various things, you have found your way, you have children and maybe little children. in few words at this age, people have done the more difficult and they can use their time for pleasure, for resting, for what they want. 

On the other hand, be young is not such an easy thing and it is often a difficult part of life, over all the teenage period. indeed teenage is the time of self construction,the time to discover love, problems, to take the first decisions... And that is not an easy thing because teenagers don't have a lot of experience yet neither self confidence. In addition, the youth is a tricky period concerning relationships: young people are not nice between each other and a lot of them suffer a lot during this time.  Youth and more particularly teenage are transitions and changes times and for that they're not always cool and easy. You lose some beautiful things like innocence, purity, inconsciense and so on; you enter in the real world and the deception can be high.
At the contrary, older people have already made their life, they have more experience about life and thanks to that they meet less difficulties to resolve a problem.

All in all, of course i can't say that i prefer to be young or old, it is not the question but i think that every age has its advantages and its setbacks. But i do believe that the most difficult is to be young because it implies a lot of problems and questions for whose we are not always ready."
9073,0,"Yes, I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products much better than they really are.  The nature of advertisements is to sell, be it a consumer product or a political message.  In order to sell, advertisements often exhibits the following features:

First of all, advertisements often create an attractive image associated with the product to their consumers or their audience.  Advertisements, especially those TV ads with sound and picture, often present the products to consumers in a more appealing way.  For example, an advertisement for Nextle Coffee in China.  The TV ad has several handsome young men and elegant young women sipping coffee with a background soundover ""great flavor, great taste!"".  People in China watched this ad unconsciously have the impression that cool, trendy, handsome people drink coffee.  The sales of Nextle coffee shot up after the ad.  Though tea is more popular in China, yet the attractive image presented in the ad lured many tea drinkers to buy Nextle coffee.  They want to be associated with the trend.  In this case, advertisements here add halo effect to the products.  

Secondly, advertisements often use image leader to convey appealing message to their audience.  For example, Nike's TV ad with Michael Jordon playing a basket ball accompanying the Nike logo and ""just do it"" message is very tempting.  People feel that wearing Nike shoes, they can be more successful.  It creats an illusion.  Because people admire Jordon and they want to buy the shoe brand he is wearing.  Here, Jordon is the image leader.  People follow suit.  People want to identify themselves with famous people.

Finally, advertisements often only mention the positive things about the products and ignore or downplay the side effects or negative aspects of the produccts.  For example, ads for drugs.  ""Ask your doctor if this medicine is for you"" instead of mentioning the side effects.

In sum, advertisements are marketing tools.  They cannot truly reflect what products they are.  They often elevate the products."
10382,0,"When it comes to the statement ""Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities"",  i always think of my father's childhood. Comparing the society when my father was a child and today's society, I get a feeling that young people in nowadays  are too busy with their own works and i often expereince the coldness of people, thesedays. 

  In my father's childhood, people were not pressured by time. He tells me that there were more chances to clean his town and to help old people who were living soley. However, in our modern society, you can always see young people watching their clocks and running around with a number of heavy bags. People in today's world, are working when they should be helping their communities. 

  My father often reminds me that there were nothing more important than family and neighbour when he was a child. If one of his neighbours was getting married, all people in his town came to his wedding to celebrate, even the students and the school teachers! But now, young people do not even have time to celebrate his or her own birthdays. Therefore, when it comes for young people to help or celebrate other people, they are not so willingful because they hardly ever received these kind of warmness before. 

 Due to the rapid change of the society, young people have a loads of work to do in stead of helping their communities and young people are losing their friendness when they should be socializing with people in their communities. May be, it is the time for young people to be relaxed and have a look around them."
3894,0,"Although advertisement is a rather effective and influencial way to increase the sell of products in our modern society I agree with the statement that ""most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are"" for the following reasons:

There is a hidden economical stategy behind advertisement: the goal to attract as much people as possible in order to make the largest amount of money at the same time, since every company or enterprise wants to profit most from money spent by customers for the goods offered. Hence there is competition on the market which advertisments for the goods of every producing company is effective for, pretending that the goods of these or those companies are the best ones. 

A further argument for my point of view is that advertisements for products are not necessary by engendering illusions out of reality since in former centuries marketing which advertisement is a part of  not even existed so people only praised the goods by talking to each other about it. The goods were always in great demand and had to be produced since wars occured all over the world much more than nowadays destroying agricultur and economic structures again and again. Modern technology was also missing which brings me to the next point.

Today we have this technology to produce greater and greater masses of products for people which are in longer periods of peace than in the past so advertisement becomes important to still get a profit or even the maximum of profits from the shrink of the urgent need of products in order to survive. People must by all means be influenced by advertising campaigns in order to still get attracted in some way of the already long existing production of products of all kinds. There is no urgent use in order to survive in our western civilized countries.

It occurs very often that I watch television or read a newspaper or journal were advertisements for several products are presented. Sometimes I decide to buy a product but initially when I test it I become aware of the ordinary use or taste of the product that I already know for years which has not developed to a considerable positive and different extend. So generally to me advertisement is manipulation of people for products that already exist in our everyday life or new products like cell-phones with many new options that are not really necessary for us to survive and they are even harmless."

5738,0,"Nowadays, companies are searching for qualified, aware and specialized people for them to join. The level of difficulty and competition has increased, persons who want to achieve a good position in a companie and a good pay need to master their subject and be able to resolve any problems related to their specific career. Therefore, specializing in one specific subject is the key to success not only because it will give u an  exellent knowledge about it but also a better chance to get the job you dream off.

  In today's societty, people have to get threw high level education and programs in order to get their certificates which are the key to their future success. Being specialized in a certain field gives the possibilty to explore all its parts accuratly and have a total control about it all. Moreover, being able to master all of its parts gives u a personal satisfaction, the feeling you are unbeatable in this subject makes u feel emotions you would have never imagine u would feel. In addition, our new society requires the best out of all of us in order to live peacefully and in serenity. Therefore, a person specialized has a better chance to acheive this way of leaving then a person having a broad  knowledge of many academics subjects.

  Additionnally, people always have a subject they prefer in life. Therefore, focusing on our strenght would be better for us. For example, a person geting A scores in math, would join an economic firm or an engeneering companie, based on what he or she enjoys and is good at. Moreover, being specizlized in the field and subject we prefer and are outstanding at will higher our chances of success.

  In conclusion, I consider that being specizlized in one specific subject we enjoy would allow us to be more succesful in life then a person that has a broad knowledge of many academic subjects, considering the level required, in order to live in a decent and peaceful way, has increased."

4512,0,"I agree with the statement, most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.  
	For example, the health care industly, especially those diet products.  ""It is so easy, and so quick to lose weight.""  Then why is 50% of population overweight in this country?  Advertising with loud background music, good looking models, and catchy frases.  That's all you need to convence people to buy product.  Unfortunatley, I am one of the people who just overpowered by advertisements on TV.  I bouthg a treadmill which I thought it was the greatest product that I can lose weight with less work.

It is so powerful that  overpowering people's ability to think in this materialistic world we live in.  If the commercial says so, it is good product.  You need to stop to think what is really going on.  It is so controled by advertisement industry, people forget that we do have ability to think what best for you.

10525,0,"Young people today do not seems to care much about their community and do little to help them.
The young generations seem to be too busy studying, working or relaxing to spend time for their community, but it is not only their fault. It is also the fast changing world that brought them to this stage, they do not seem to have time for anything but their own business. 
This is also because of the technological development that changed our lives by making things quicker and filling our days with more and more tasks to accomplish instead of keeping their number constant and giving us more time for ourselves or our community. The result is that at the end of the day we are a lot more stressed and tired and only care of relaxing. A good example is mobile phones that make us reacheble for work matters even while taking a walk in the park after office hours, often there is no clear cut between work and private life. 
Young people are normally those who take innovations more seriously and so they are the ones that always find something to do, no matter wheter it is useful or not, they are just not able to stop for a second.
Society today is also more self-centered: people is aiming more at personal success and wealth and this of course brings people away from dedicating time to their community because in their mind every second of time is precious for themselves and somebody else can take care of the community.
If this is the stereotype of the modern man, it is also going to be the model for young people and since they are smart and very quick at learning (thanks also the higher average level of education) they will lose no time and forget about the community.
It is easy to find evidence of this as always less people volunteer to work for charities, hospitals and churches, but we can also notice it in the little things: so many people throw papers in the streets like they do not care because somebody will clean it sooner or later, this is a sign of missing respect to the community and it is jut like not dedicating time to it since the environment is also part of the community.
Young people really do not know what it means to dedicate time to their community because they hardly ever do, they look at it has a waste of time and this is mainly because of the changing modern culture."
9209,0,"Nowadays, oil becomes even rarer and even more expensive and some people believe that in thwenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. We will explain why this statement could occur or not in the future.

On the one side, petroleum is becoming more and more expensive to produce because there are limited areas where we can find it and lots of them are unreachable or unavailable, for instance because they are under big cities. 
Moreover, governments are developping tube, train or bus to encourage people not using their own car and to pollute less. For example, lots of advertisements for taking the train instead of driving are currently shown in the tube in Paris.

On the other side, the population of Third-World countries is growing, and at the same time, lots of people who were using the bike in China are considering bying a car.
Futhermore, lots of workers still need a car when they do not live in big cities because busses are not as frequent. For this reason, it is still easier for them to rely on their own car rather than on a bus that can pick them just every hour.
Besides, scientists are considering developping cars with hybrid motors, which rely both on electricity and oil. It could be a very good solution to the cost of the oil. For the moment, those cars are puchased above all in Japan but thay may be soon be sold in all the countries of the world.

To put it in a nutshell, the issue of the cars is rather an issue of oil supply. Till hybrid cars are not very fame, the number of cars could hence decrease. However, it would rather be the case in big cities where people have other ways to go to work. To my mind, twenty years is a very short time to introduce hybrid cars but it is also a vey short time to make people change their behaviour by not using their can as often as today."
3682,0,"I have to admit that concepts and ideas are often neglected next to all the facts that students have to learn. History lessons are a good example. If you know all the dates, names and places that does not mean that you have understood the complex interaction of causes, consequences and motivations. Sometimes it is not even necessary to know exactly on which day or where something happend. Important is THAT it happened. What led to it and its impact on the future may be of much greater interest than its exact date. Is it not much more important what Einstein discovered than knowing on what day he was born? Is it not more important to know that his invention led to the nuclear bomb than to know the place where he was born?
Of course, without facts nothing works. You could not teach history without dates, names and places. You could not explain any concept or idea without the facts that it bases on. Facts are the foundation to any thinking beyond. You can only understand why Einstein gave his idea to the americans if you know the fact that he was a jew. 
That is why I think that there should be a balance between facts and more. Students should get those facts that are necessary to understand the concept. In my eyes they are both equally important. One without the other is nothing. If you know all the elements of a computer you still cannot put them together correctly. If you possess the instruction but do not have all the elements it does not work either. And even if you have both it is not easy. But if someone explains it to you you might succeed. This is what teachers should do. They should give students the facts, some material about how to understand them and explain the big connections.
I do not think that ideas and concepts are more important than facts, each is important in its own way. Ideas and concepts are based on facts. Students should learn both to be prepared for life."
5722,0,"Concepts are generally defined as general ideas whereas facts are linked with events that happened, things which are less abstractive. So, saying that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts is quite restrictive. It is clear to me that students need both.

I think indeed that learning facts on which you can lay yourself to understand concepts is essential. For a student in history for example, facts and dates are the basis to think about a larger period. The concept of power for instance often need to be illustrated by behaviors of kings or presidents in Europe for centuries. In this case, knowing accurate facts feeds your thoughts.

On the other hand, one could argue that for a student in philosophy, ideas and concepts are much more important than facts. Or for a student in mathematics too. All this leads me to believe that facts sometimes can be put apart. Yet, when you can help you with facts, I think concepts are easier to understand. In scientific subjects especially. Likewise, in a physic course about gravity, showing an apple falling onto the floor is a good way to start the lesson. What I mean is that the application of the principle, under the shape of a fact (the apple is attracted by the Earth), is as well important as the general idea.

Yet, it is also interesting to think twice about the question : what is the most important for a student, to understand or to learn ? This is a complex issue. Normally, as I said, learning should lead and help to the understanding. But why not only understand things ? Why not only applicate a pattern of thinking that you got when you understood one system ? Because I think that people should make profit of their capacity to learn things and then to make links with others in order to understand new things that nobody taught them. 

As a conclusion, I would say that learning facts is as important as understanding ideas and concepts, even if it can depends on the subjects (history, philosophy, geography...). I think that they are complementary. Understanding grammar rules and learning vocabulary aren't they both necessary to express oneself in a foreign language ?"
10941,0,"I disagree with the opion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. Although to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects may help people know different fields acknowledges, we only can know the surface knowledge about each subjects. So I prefer to have a specialize knowledge in one specific subject.
      To begin with, our time is limit. We can not study every subject well. We can not acquire the true knowledge and tecnical if we sperate our time into many subjects. For instance, if a students learned arts, psychology, math and drawing in his colledge life. I think he may know a lot of things.However it is difficult to him have a good mark in every fields.
       On the other hand,if we pay most of our time in one field.We can know a lot in this fields than others. For example, a student whose subject is psychology pay most of his time in the psychology.Maybe he can know this field well. He can write papers about this fields and find job in this fields.
      In summary, I think it is better to have a specailize broad knowledge in one subject than to broad knowledge in many subjects. It is good for person and the whole society."
10626,0,"I agree with the sentence that most advertisements and most negative spots make products seem much better than they really are. This is real for lots of reasons.
 
Firstly,a company which product a good or a service want always show the best in its business expecially when it want to compete with another group wich sell to people the same article. For this reason they often tell people lies about their good through television,city posters or magazines and people trust it,but when someone buys their famous thing, is not really how they describe to us! For example,one day my mother had decided to buy an hair-phon which should resist to water and repared you from electrical waves but when it fall in the ground with some water drops she broke it. She was so scared!

Secondly, for new objects we have not the idea of the name of who product it. If I buy a Valentino's dress I think it would be better then an H&M's one because the name is very important and show you the past of a work group. The companies which obtain the fame with their goods and their service have a best expectative in the consumer and the satisfaction of an expectative create fedelty in the buyer.


In conclusion, I think advertisements are often a lie or an enlargement of the real usefulness of an object but I think also that someone with their work have increase their fame in people in a good way."
650,0,"I agree with the statement that says young people enjoy life more than older people do. It is because young people tend do to be optimistic towards life whereas older people tend to be realistic. I am 21 years old now and I consider myself young, and I think I can do anything I want in my life. It sounds more enjoyable and exciting when people thing that they can do everthing. However, the older you become, the tougher the life becomes, so older people tend to forget how to dream and enjoy life itself. It is probably because of these things: money, family and health.

 First, when you get older, you think about money a lot. money that comes from job can't easily break your savings. to be an adult is to be independent somehow, so you should make a living by yourselves. but when you are young, you can live with your parents and still have a part-time job and spend it on your own. I was the richest when I was in high school, living in a house and do whatever. when you have money, you can enjoy your life more because you can do a lot of things. especially the money can spend on your own.
 
 Next thing I want to point out is the family. Like I said in the second paragraph, when you are young and don't have your kids yet, you can almost do anything. however, things will be different if you have kids. Your free time will be limited and you always have to think about your family and also the BILLS!! Jobs may not be the prpfable ones but you still have to work for your family. Occupation is the number one factor for an adult to be stressed, and stress can make people enojoy their life. It will be just pain in the neck.

 Last but not least, as you get older, your body will not listen to you as it used to. I don't have any disabilities or bad guts or anything right now, but if I look at my  mother, she is always complaining about her health. she says she has bad legs and waist, and she doen't like to go out often. Just sitting at home won't be the best thing to do but what if there is no choice? so I think I do what I can do when I'm still young and take advantage of being young.

 In the mean time, there will be time that I can enjoy my life as older people, however, being young is just one facotor of life that onlder cannot beat."
7081,0,"During almost 18 years, I studied many courses and I know the best way to learn. So what I am sure about : the idea is the most important thing to understand than the facts. I will explain this in two general parts : the first part will be about the idea that a fact is one example of the idea; and the second one will deal with the fact that we can easier an idea than a fact.


	So first, it is obvious that the idea is most important thing to understand because the facts are just some cases of the main idea. Usually, during the classes, the teachers try to explain us an example which permits to understand the idea. For example, to better understand the idea that people is calm when they listen music, it's to give the example that in many medical rooms, we can hear some classical or jazz music. But it is not the point expected to learn. Thus, this is something we can use to better understand something else.
	When we try to make our own opinion, we use the ideas memorised to think. In this important case, we can see why it is so more important to learn the ideas than the facts. If we continue with our previous example, what do we think about the importance of Music in the world? To answer, we could select the idea that Music calms people and we could use it to conclude that without Music, there will might be more Wars in the World, and so, most of the population of the Earth will be sad. It is in this way I see the importance of the ideas.

	As I proved in this response, to better learn, we have to more concentrate on the ideas than on the facts. But the facts are needed to understand the ideas. So, in the perfect case, we would care about ideas as well as facts."
3279,0,"When people travel our own country or the other parts of the world, people often travel in a group and also take a tour guide with them.
  I agree with the idea about the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. Although there could be some disadvantages about going in groups.
   In my point of view, first of all, we need some information about the place that we are travelling. Of course we can get information about almost averything on the Internet, but it is so hard to get a very specific information and it will take up so much time and can be very stressful before traveling. But if we go in a group led by a tour guide, we can share some informations with other members of the group and we can ask all the questions we want to know about the place that we are traveling to the tour guide at the same time when we are traveling. 
  Secondly, we can spend our time very efficiently through the whole traveling time. Because when we travel in a group, we cannot travel without a schedule, and if we do not, it will be very disorganize with a lot of people. So we have to have a specific schedule. Which makes us feel very satisfied, after the whole travel. 
  Thirdly, we can get to know each others more that we did not know about before, while traveling in a group and  there are economical advantage also.
    There could be some diadavantages about traveling in a group with a tour guide. For example, people might think that they cannot have their free time and feel uncomfrtable about always moving in a group with a fixed schedule. However, it is better than being so stressful about getting information about the place ourselves and get lost in a new place we are traveling. 
  Consequently, because of all those reasons I think the best way to travel is in a group that led by a tour guide."
8394,0,"Some people think students should learn the result of facts. Even though that is importnat for stdents, I myself believe comprehension of ideas and concepts are more neccessary for mordern life. 

	People enable to manage their skills to their life easily. For example, when a person knows how to figure math concepts, the person can use the math ideas to develop in the computer programing field. If the person wants to be computer creater, the concepts of math skills always help the person to improve the business.

	Learning facts is risky to interfer students' motivation. It is always fun to think and create the answer even though the answer is wrong. Students always think about their problems so that they can discover theirselves to solve the problmes. For example, in math class students always spend much time to consider to figure out the answer. People can cooperate with their friends to overcome and find solusion. This process help sutdents to make motivation of studies.

	
	Finally, learning only result is not always true. Again, math class could be good example. Many people notice text books often have some mistakes. When a student only learns the fact, a studnet might misunderstand everything.

	Therefore, there are three reasons that I do not agree to learn only facts. Understanding ideas and concepts help people to use their paticular subject to their life easily. Also, this has posibily to improve students' motivation fo studies. Finally, the facts sometimes mistake from the text."

Of Course advertisements make products seem much better than they are otherwise nobody would like to by them.

Considering first the physical aspect, it cannot be denied that a lot of energy runs through young and healthy subjects veins and just for this simple reason they enjoy the things of life more, literally. Moreover we have to consider that young people vision of life is unlimited, meaning with this that they look at life as something that is not going to end; at least not soon. The latter provides them with more reasons and energies to enjoy their existence. My young brother, aged 7, for example is able to play all day long without rest enjoying every single moment and feeling very intense emotions and, importantly, with not many worries and responsabilities. I envy him.

On the other hand, while the quality of life is underestimated by youngsters, while elder people know (or should know) what is the value of life, because they are not left with much of it.
They appriciate more consciously the gift of life. They can use their wisdom to make better choices. They don't feel things with the same intensity of the time when they were young, which even mean that they don't feel sufferings so intensively. The know exactely what they want, and they feel less lost in any kind of situation.
My grandmother for example is 97 and now she is in a facility hospital. She does not move around so much as she's on a wheel chair but...Well, the way she smiles when my mother or I go visit her, you can really tell that she is valuating that little episode in a way that a young and in a good shape person wouldn't be able to do, because he|she would likely be very worried about the future, the job, and many other things.

In the end it depends on the personal attitude, as always."

However, their are still lots of other young people who loves to help their communities and voluntier for hard social works.
  First of all, in case of Korea, young students are anticipating for voluntiary work for 40 hours per year. Even tough it is kind of an school homework, every students are helping their communities by visiting old peoples who doesnt have any relatives, or orphanage and some of them really feel pleased to help them. 
   Fortheremore, in Korea, when students attend universities they try to participate more actively because they can have more free time than before. Not everybody but lots of my feriends are voluntiering to  teach elementary to high school students who are not available to have a tutor without receiving money. Some of them also visit elder persons who are lonly to talk with them persistently.
  It is true that some young people seems to think only themself but their are still lots of young people how are helping their communities. It is dangerous to overlead all the young people is selfish."
8293,0,"Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities at all , and this will have very harmful effects on the community in the future .
	Why are they not giving enough time to helping their communities ? I think because the are busy enjoying their life , having fun , busy in life, Just thinking in them selfs  , they are not thinking in others .
	They will face the results in the future. For example : poor people nobody take care of them , except when we have a problem and you can do nothing you will go to god and ask god to solve your problem and you will make an agreement with god that if your problem was solved , lets say you will give the poor people food , and thats because they don't think in poor people at all .
	This is not the big problem . The problem is that in the future thoes povierty that the young generation didnot takecare of will start to act agressively maybe by murders , stealing toward this community and it will be very hard to stop them .
	I believe that the best way to prevent this is by taking care of these people , who knows they might help the community in someway or other, for example : Mickale jorden , the best basketball player all over the world and he is very famous , this guy when he was young he couldnot efford to join a club , but when he found the care he bacame a star and now all the world knows him .what i mean that we can help these people by persuading people to help the , Why don't we make a special day in the year that all people an the world in this day will support the by anything , money , food blankets, anything, even used books , anything we might not find it useful for us maybe it will be usefull for them ."
10822,0,"Nowadays there is some thing affects the communities that their young people do not give enough time to help their communitise . That habens because of the followeing reasons : they have to study hard in schools or colleges , there are alot of entertainamint stuffs that take alot of there time , and they don't fell the importance of helping the community.
       
      First , today the student has to study hard if he want to  has a good futuer . studying hard takes a lot of time from the student . In the test week the parents may not see their son only for come menuites and then he goes to study . Studying not give the student enough of time to help the community.
      
      Seconde , nowedays there are entertainamint stuffs that the young people plays for example ,vidoe games ,TV  , and football .
these thing take   from young people alot of time playing it.
       
       Third ,  young people now don't fell th importance of helping the community . They didnT learn that the community depend on them and they have to do anything to devilop their communities .
 
        We can see now the reasons why young people do not give enough time to their communities . They have to scadeual their studies . They have to avoid playing all the time .Adults have to tell them why helping is  importante for theier community . Then, they will have a a lot of time to helping their communities"
9181,0,"To answer that question, we need to ask another question "" is success measured by the things we do or how we do things?"", if the answer was ""by the things we do"" then i dissagree, because people will always take risks as a fact of success and not as a choice, the reason behind that is that people tend and rather feel safe than to take risks with a big possibility of failure, for example: if there is a shoemaker who worked in that field for almost twenty years and have no experiance what so ever in any other field, then that man have two choices, to continue his work knowing that its a failure - we agreed that success is measured by ""the things we do""- or changing his field to any other practice that he knows nothing about, and taking a huge risk by changing his field. Fundimintaly this man will have a very low rate of success, and may lose his furtune by changing the work he does to things he dont. At the same time this man wanted success and that what we all want, so in fact he had no choice, he had to follow that path.
   If that was the case, we will find that many of the businesses will collapse beacuse of the shifting of fields done by non-specilized people, the doctor wants to be a pilot, the accountant wants to be an engineer and the cat wants to be the mouse.
   On the other hand; if the answer was ""by how we do things"", then we can achieve our goals and success, for we will do our work in a well planned and organized way, even if risk is there, it wont efeect our work to the point of failure."
1715,0,"Nowadays cars a the most important medium of traveling large distances and therefore they are used often and regularly. Nevertheless, the developement of technic could lead to fewer cars to be used in twenty years. For that, however, political and social circumstances still would need to change.
First, due to the fact that also in future people still will need to travel, it it very important that the governments of today support other mediums of mass transportation like trains or buses. If financially supported from the politics, traveling by bus would be cheaper than traveling by car and people might change their habits of using their cars every time they need to go somewhere. In case a person wants to visit a friend, living in another country, and the less expensive way to go there was by train, I am conviced that he or she would buy a train  ticket instead of new petrol for his or her car, That is why politicans could change the cirucumstances of transportations and therefore the number of used cars in the future.
Second, also the social circumstances concerning the attitude of people towards their cars would need to be changed. These days a car not only represents a medium of traveling but also shows the character and the social situation of its owner. The car of a very rich man, a BMW with a chauffeur for example, differs completely from the car of a poor family father, who has to pack his four children and his wife into an old mini-van. If a car quited to be a part of a persons reputation and of a way of presenting social welfare its meaning and its use would change likewise.
However, altough I would appreciate these circumstance to change for the better, I do not believe that neither the politicians nor the people will change their attitude towards the use of cars. 
In addition to that, changing circumstances always demands a lon periode of time. No political nor social developement in the last ten years, however, indicates a similar change in the attitude both politically and socially. 
In conclusion, that is the reason why I do not believe that fewer cars will be in use in twenty years."
6717,0,"I claim learning facts is more important than understanding ideas and concepts. I explain my idea by using the example of  controversy of article 9 of Japanese constitution.
	Just knowing the ideas and concepts do not directly mean we have the understanding on the topic and having the opinion to act for it.  Thinking about the controversy over article 9, the argument  wether revising it or not. Surely, understanding its history that have kept our country peaceful for 60 years, and its idea and concept of renouncing the war after the tragetic memory of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is very important. But by just ""understanding"" the ideas of exsitance of it, we cannot protect ourselves from the threat of terrorism. 
	So what are we needed to live? We are strongly needed to  be ""learning"" the facts of the Japan facing now, and the ways we can take for maintaining the peace. What happens when North Korean missile are launched  to Japan? Do we not fight for it? Or we fight with self defence forces which is well known to be not suit the article 9 itself. 
	Therefore, understanding the ideas and concepts are not helpful in our lives. It is a very idealism. Its good to have, but does not  do anything to us. It's not practical. What I want to claim in this essay is that is not the importance of article 9, but that learning facts and to know what we can do for it next, is much more important in our real lives."
2764,0,"Succesful people always try to do new things this is like a habit for them.When  somebody commonly journalist ask about this subject ,they always answer  with similar reasons such as for public acclaim or everybody wait new things from them or just for feeling. Here I want to share my ideas about this subject.
  First  of all,generally successful singers or artists have this kind of problem. They have to  do diferent things every films or albums.If they do not do this ,their funs can loose their interest to them.Therefore this is the starting to ending for them. When they loose their admireing images,they will be nobody like ordinary people.For 'nstance old movie stars we do not remember most of them know and their star do not rising.
   Secondly,I think  to be successful is a habit for successful people due to the fact that they akways follow success.For example , some of the well known businessmen are always try to produce and sale new things.This is like a habit for them such as Nokia ,they alwat produce new generatin phones and sale to society.They always need to top of the mountain.They can not accept to be second.
    Finally,if somebody being a success, all society waited  new things from them.This not only their aspect but also our responcibility too,
   In conclusion,successful people addicted to success ,This  is not always good for them.Sometimes they feel unhappy.Although,if they do not have this addiction ,we could not establish much more."
10747,0,"Yes , I completely agree with the statement "" YOUNGPEOPLE ENJOY LIFE MORE THAN OLDER PEOPLE DO"". We live our lifes to our fullest when we are young, leaving behind the worries and the intricasies of old age.So i feel that young people enjoy life  more due to their being more energitic, with young minds fresh from college, with lots of ideas that are trying to creep out.
         ""OLD IS GOLD"" is a popular saying the some people advocate. They think that older people are more experienced and know the ways of the world better that the younger blood. But  I feel that a younger blood has lot of energy to offer and can work for a cause with a greater intensity than a older indivisual can. Like , a project to be completed with a deadline. A younger person can work late nights and will finish the project no matter what come in his way. He will work harder to make a place for him in this world.
            The older people have mind that are worn out, by age , by time. Whereas a younger mind have lot of ideas to offer. These are fresh brains, that have come right from college, filled with all sorts of  new tools and the virgour to put those tools to action.And also there is no burden of a family to support. A younger person has more time to finish a job at hand than his older counterpart as he has to spend time with his wife, his chilldren, his home ............. , this list can go endless. 
   Above all the dating of girl, gives you so,divine a feeling that hardly can be expressed by words. We can date a lot of girls , enjoy parties, go to different clubs, chill out and do whatever we like. There is none to stop us or brooding over us to get home quickly,as your son is getting late to go to his soccer practice or your daughter has to go to beauty parlour. 
     I feel that this world is meant for the younger generation, and they have to live life to the fullest in this period only."
3190,0,"Succession is an issue that may be interpeted different by each person who talk about.However, it is important to thing different in order to become succesful.That's why it can be said that succesful people try new things and take risks.
   The first case of being succesful is thinking different. The people who were uniqe  in their own mojors cought the success by the diffence. Each people have different skills; some of them are think better , some of them have the physical ability. However, in order to become succesful it is very significant to thing different and try new things. Succesful people use the things which are already known in order to reach their goals. However, when you think that many people can learn the things which are already known. The difference appears on this point. While many people may learn these things, few of them try to find new things. Therefore the people who try that are succesful.
   Another case is taking risks. This is the most critical case. Courage is the merely thing on this factor. Many people generally avoid from taking risks. They want to obtain success clearly. That may be possible but generally not addequet. Many succesful people take risks in order to do what they want. For instance, when we look at the life of successful businessmans it is very easy to see the risk that they take to reach the top. One of the rules of this issue is that you must take the risk of loose.
   In conclussion, It is very essential  to try new things and take risks because the way of success pass through here.All things considered that many succesful people do these things."
4621,0,"I do agree with the statement and I woud be even more radical: I think all the advertisements try to make the products better than what they really are. sometimes they do not succeed but I think the intentions are always to present the products at best, no matter what the real features are. The reasons must be searched in the aim of the advertisement itself: an advertisement is a message that must convince and persuade people to buy the product it talks about, and to buy that exact product and not some of the others on the market. To obtain this aim the people who makes the advertisement can rarely escape the strong temptation to go beyond the line of an objective description of the product, especially if there are many similar products on the market a customer could choose from. Therefore as the number of products on the market have increased esponentially, the advertisement had to introduced more and more sophisticated and intrusive mechanisms to get its aim of convincement. In this way the real features of the product advertised have lost more and more attention, in favour of other messages which are indirectly and in a more subtle way connected in our mind to the product itself. These messages make use of attractive areas like beauty,  beautiful actress, actors, models are often showed connected to the product, sexual messages are also used in different ways, other messages that make use of some values and stereotypes, like brave men, happy families and so on. Summing up I think advertisement has gone far beyond the limit of presenting a product, maybe ignoring the negative features and emphasizing the best ones; It has become a powerful and intrusive activity that makes use of all the means it can to obtain its scope. It not only wants to convince people to buy something instead of something else, it also tries to create the needs of new products and services.  Therefore it is not surprising that many times we are convinced to buy products by the way they are presented in their advertisements, or just because we want to feel like the handsome actor using that product, but then we have to face a strong disappointment."
11885,0,"Now days, the spanish young people has another mentality. I know a lot of people with my same age that they have time to helping the communities. But also, I know a lot of friends that certenly they do not has any time to help. Why? Because they has to study a lot and also they has to work to pay his house. 
	In one hand, the young people have a lot of fun and everybody knows that we can reduce that time. And that time we can dedicate to helping their communities. And in the other hand, a lot of people directly they do not think about this topics. I think that side is made a very bad person. For example, always when one of those,  expreses his ideas the people of other countries tend to archieve all in the same box. 
	So, I think that it is a very polemic statement. I think this is not goging to change with a statement. We have to remote to the roofs of the people, and there change the mentality. Also, the primary education needs to change in this type of child formation. If you teach a kids that there exist more important things in the life than the money, the studys, or the work. I think that the next generation they will grow in this aspect. And the people will be more happy with thw others."
5725,0,"Gone are the days when people used to say "" Jack of all trade and master of none"". Today in this competitive era, the time has come when we should rephrase this popular saying that "" jack of all trades becomes the master."" I feel that a person having wider knowledge succeeds in life. Although specialization is needed to excell in certain field but in the developing society where everyone is busy in the race of cats and dogs, one has to excell in every field.
We can take the example of so many scientific experiment which has led to a new discovery. Even a simple biological experiment requires the effort of people from different field such as chemist and physicist. Had there been no chemist to provide chemicals and reagents for purifying DNA and had there not been any physicist to develop machinery for us, we would not have sequenced the genetic material in us, and the use of these requires the knowledge of these area. The various exams such as the one i am giving also makes us realise that it is better to have broader knowldge of many academic subject. 
Also, i feel that having a broader knowledge increases the learning and application power. We can think bigger and put in our vast knowledge to do great innovation. We should have general studies about the culture and history even if we study science. In various intervews and examination, the questionairre are not from what we have learned specifically but about our knowledge and i feel its good too because this can only tell how we know about things happening around us.
Broader knowledge not only help us lead  a successful life but also make us an improved human being. It helps us in better understanding and thus leading a better life."
11355,0,"Making so generel a statement (such as ""young people enjoy life more than older people do"") can only lead to an ambiguous answer: one cannot divide the world so easily. 
It appears theoretically right to say that young people enjoy more life; I would say they have less reasons to be bitter: they have not yet been confronted to the affliction. For example they don't know about the wounds of love, the stress of work or the responsibilites of adult life like monetary preoccupations. Children have much to learn and their ignorance protects them from unhappiness.
But it is this same ignorance that rules their somehow unstable behaviour: unhappiness (manifested through abundance of tears, screams) can hit them for an unimportant reason. A child who sees his parents go for work might seem to have seen them die,  crying for long minutes; their despair is intense. This emotional unstability has another side: unhappiness does rarely last and the crying child  can be seen a few minutes later playing and laughing.
Older people feel sadness differently and it changes their overall happiness in various ways: some will bear with pain the numerous difficulties they have encountered in their life; they will accumulate and eventualy they will spend all day thinking about their preoccupations or afflictions, neglecting the simple  pleasures of life. A grown-up man will think about the girlfriend he just lost and think that there is no happy love; he will see his parent grow old ant think of death, of the vanity of life. 
But on the opposite hand a man with the same background can react very differently: if he has a philosophical temper, he will not fear death and think of a forthcoming love; the thunderous atmosphere in his workplace will seem mundane, because they have seen it twice, thrice and more. Nothing surprises him and he lives in serenity, or at least he knows how to deal with the pains of life.
To say that young people enjoy more life than older people can be true, but we must add that young people suffer more intensely from life and its small details than grown-ups. Older people normally have a more linear behaviour, generally sad when they don't know how to gauge the importance of what affects them, generally happy when they do."
8900,0,"Regarding the statement I consider myself absoluley in favour, since under my perspective, advertisements are intended only to persuade the reader or listener to buy the product. They dont really care if you like or not the advertisement, they just focus on the economic effect of it. As a result they are willing to give a wrong idea of a product in order to ensure their economic profit of it. 

As a matter of example, we daily see comercials of food, where for instance food is prepared in a certain manner that it simply looks irresitible to your eyes. They tend tu use severall implements that provide a changed version of what the food really was. Recalling the example of a burguer we can appeciate the way in which they will show the burguer as a tentative meal. Some aspects such as its texutre and  physical appearance might be modified in order to ensure that you create a mental image of the burguer and your future meal might be it. Also they can create or manipulate people comments regarding the burger so that for instnace you get to know what other felt when eating such meal.

Another type of prduct that tends to be used for advertisements are the excersice machines, that are shown to be easier to work on, and proved to have inmediate results. The main objective of this is to sell a determined apparatus that will provide what they think  your body requires, for instance The AB Pro is a machine to work on where you by just slightly moving train your muscles and reinforce their shape. The advertisement uses well prepared and fine physically people to use the machine in order to give you the idea that after using it, you will end as that person.

The truth is that advertisements actually provide us of information concerning severall product. However due to the fact that their objective is to promote a product they are prepared to modify the products in some aspects in order to ensure the selling of it. Just like the example given of the buguer and the machine where you actually see a changed product in order to persuade you on buying that particular object. Obviously the modification they do on the product is intended to make it look better, so that you are willing to buy it."
4502,0,"""Technology has always been a boon to the society"", Due to advancement in technology there are smaller and efficient ways to finish a particular task. The population growth of the cars has also been a major part of concern. We are striving hard enough to meet the requiremnts of todays world. So, I feel that twenty years down the line we may have very fewer cars on the roads.
	In twenty years from now technology will be so advanced that person can work efficiently sitting at home or being online, so there is not much to travel and work at the same time. Nowadays people are looking for luxury and work together. They do not want themselves to stress a lot but, at the same time work harder and efficiently. Think of people during ancient times, they were happy and contented with the work and efforts they used to put in at that time, but now the scenario is different people are looking towards the world with a broder perspective, they want to gain more and put less. They do not want to sit ideal but also do not want to stress themselves.
	With the growth in population, competition is increasing rapidly and people are looking focused towards their work. They prefer to work more and gain more but, with ease. People will be getting stuff ready at their doorstep and thus there does not arise a need to travel through cars and waste time as  time is precious.
	Cars are polluting the city heavily nowadays and so i feel that the government will provide other means of transport twenty years from now and ban cars. May be this step will help us to get a healthy and pure environment.
	Thus, one can mearly suggest that the rate of cars twenty years from now will surely decrease. Some other means of transport may arise which will help to secure and improve the environment. There will also be a lot of advancement in technology which will help us to achieve this."
2528,0,"On my opinion, the success during life is given by a variety of elements: luck, capacity to choose the right moment to do something, knowledge of course and, for sure, the capacity to try new risks, new thinghs and new challenges rather than only doing what you already do well. Let's think about some examples. The economic field is full of people that started from nothing, had a particularly good business idea and became rich and famous in a relatively short time. I have in mind the example of Henry Ford: he had the idea, he developed it and everyone now knows his name. Of course, you don't just need a good idea but you need also other elements, like the ones I wrote above. Moreover you have to know that you are facing big risks that could completely destroy what you have made. Let's Imagine an hipotetic world in which people do not love cars: the Henry Ford's idea would probably not have been successful. This is part of the risk.
Another good example is the following. Let' s imagine a shares market investor: he could behave in a not aggressive way, investing almost all the amount of his money in bonds and just a few money in shares or he could risk trying to gain as much as he can with the shares of an emerging country. Well, if everything goes well for him, he will become richer than before otherwise he will lose what he has. Stating this, I do not want to say that it is better to risk instead of having a secure return; I just want to say that to have success you need to be a little risky and try new challenges that you have not already tried.
But maybe it is not the only way to have success. If you do something well, sometimes it is not useful to try new experiences. It could be better to try to specialize yourself more on your activity to achieve the success in your field.
So, on my opinion, the best way depends on your personality and on how much you want to risk everything you have done until the moment you decide if it is better or not to try new challenges."
1085,0,"The present topic can be well depicted in that broad knowledge can help us to grab our ability in various fields that can help us to know better about different facets. 
                               The main thing about having knowledge in different fields can help us to interrelate our opinion to the maximum extent. For example Environmental Sciences is an multidisciplinary branch of sciences in which different aspects like air, soil, and the aspects of water can be known. In addition the changes that are occuring with in the total atmosphere can be well described or well known. In this branch ther can be great interrelationship between one another in many forms or they can show a graet dependency on one another. Like wise having knowledge in different academic subjects can help us to react to the the situations that can happen in and around us. Having specialition can be helpful in knowing the depths in that particular field but cannot gain the knowledge all though the globe or all around in various fields. One can never stick to a particular aspect in life like wise should never stick to aparticular field of study in the name of specialisation. Wide range of knowledge can only help any individual to grow to the greater standars in life. The knowledge can never be stolen or bargained at times when needed and on the other hand cannot gain knowledge at a shorter period so having a broad knowledge can definitely be the better of the things when related to stick our knowledge in the name of specialisation in one specific subject. Knowledge can be the source of wealth so having knowledge in different fields of academics can definitely be the better source of wealth. Knowledge in various academics can be broadly shared among different varities of individuals. Especially knowledge in differnt academic subjects can also help for the better oppourtunities and also can quiet effective. 
                                   So having knowledge in many academic subjects can be more worthy than limiting oneself to a particular field of study. It is definitely a boon to have knowledge in many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject."
6395,0,"I feel that it is true that successful people try new things and take risks rather than doing things they already know how to do well.

If it weren't for people ready and eager to try new things, or ways to do things , they would never discover that there were better ways to do them. Some ways may be time consuming and a waste of energy, but successful people find a way to bypass the waste , and get to their goals in a shorter,more efficient way. Imagine someone plodding along the old path going around a mountain overtaking someone who has risked going over the mountain, or perhaps even going through the mountain! It seems highly unlikely! 

Risks and new things lead to better production and better outcomes. If we hadn't had people willing to risk a new method of crop raising, or use of pesticides, we wouldn't have the increased quantities of grains that we do today. Their success in trying something new has led to an outcome beneficial not only to themselves, but to all of mankind.

This thirst for new ways in successful people has resulted in the discovery of new medicines, test tube babies, forays into space. It has resulted in the creation of industrial giants. A famous company in India, Reliance Industries Limited, has its roots in a tea stall. The late owner used to run a tea stall in a small town. Due to his vision and his dare to dream big and try a new way of refining petroleum to create useful by products, Dhirubhai Ambani (the late owner of Reliance) was extermely influential and rich and famous by the time he passed awy two years earlier. It is because of his very will to do new things that the company is now one of the most formidable in present times, so much so that it can topple or raise the stock market by the way it moves in the day's trade.

If it weren't for the dare of successful people to be different, to try something new, they wouldn't be where they are today. I hardly imagine that Dhirubhai Ambani would have been anything but a tea stall owner if he hadn't dared to try his hand at something new."
1618,0,"I disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do. The following explanations shall provide the basis for my opinion that older people enjoy life more than young people do.

Young people often seem to be happy and cheerful. They participate in a lot of activities, are often around other people and enjoy their leisure time with exciting things.

Older people often stay at home, do not have many different activities in their daily life and seem to be less excited.

The above statements decribe the surface of what the life of these two groups of society is like. In my opinion it is more important to take a look under the surface and to find out about the mental state of these people.

Young people often find themselves being put under pressure. Life for them is very difficult. They are growing up and their environment and their own attitudes and opinions change very quickly. It is difficult for young people to take decisions and to be strong. This leads to a variety of mechanisms of self-protection, which often imply an activity-oriented life. For example, many young people often go to parties. They seem to be enjoying life as much as possible. However, they are often just taking a break from their stressful life, but are still not able to truly enjoy their life. They are not truly relaxed and happy, bcause they are not really doing what is best for them.

Older people have mostly passed this phase of doubts and difficulties. They show a more relaxed attitude towards life and its surprising turns. This group of the society knows that mistakes are made and wrong decisions happen, and have learned to take everything easier. Moreover, older people to not let themselves be put under pressure by other people or circumstances. They show the ability to take more decisions in their own interest and to know what they want for their life. For example, they do not go out to parties as much as young people do. They know better that activities including a more personal social contact is worth more than just pushing away their problems. Older people are choosing their best opportunities for life and enjoy them.

The above paragraphs argue my opinion that older people enjoy life more than young people do."
11817,0,"All over the world,  if we examine the present and past, there is two kind of person, one who serves their life in the known ways, just simply survives and the extreme ones who make new things try to find new ways and takes risks which can not be taken. I am totaly agree that successful people are the ones that who try the new and  take risks even if I can not be taken before.

Firstly, success is something like not to be done by everyone, in opposite you can say that reading is a success, but nowadays it is not because everybody can read. In that point it might be a good example to give the Wright Brothers flying expriences, 100 years before they tried to fly, and they took the biggest risk which can be caused by death. They were successful inventors. And I think that is the meaning of success.

After that I can be known that the times that risks are taken might be the break down of the history, and if you dont take the risk you can not survive. In the history, there is certain times that whole future is in the hands of a human being. One cannot say that the risk of Hannibal to pass tha Alpines (the Mountain above the italy) in the middle of the winter was not a risk, but at the end he reached with his chosen army to the center of Italy to Rome. He was a successful soldier. Sometimes if you dont take risks you cannot survive.

Finally, trying new things is one of the most strong way to be successful. The other ways done by lots of people lots of time and you can see that they all not did anything new. For example, the great experimental physicist M. Faraday, try the new way of understanding the unknown area, and until he was shown on the scene it might be tried these experiments over hundred times. Of course he is a successful man because he tried the new and think the new.

All in all, the whole world is turning over the successful persons hands, and if you tried to look up their most attracted works they tried the new,they take the risk."
4704,0,"yes I am agree that young people enjoy life more than other people . I am agree with that statement beacuse when people is young they have more enthusiasm to live and enjoy life .

first reason  why I am agree young people enjoy life more beacuse student life is also part of the young life during this period student have to go study for different places . So student can enjoy of travel ,can enjoy food of different variety . some student can also prefer to go abrode for their study .so these student can take fun from that country culture .

second reason why I am agree young people enjoy life moreBecause young people is very curios about  every thing , so they are taking   steps to acheive and discover new thing . after discover these thing they become happy . young people enjoy in this way.in the old age these are the events not happens so they are lving silent life .

third reason why I am agree young people enjoy life more beacuse
for taking enjoy physical fitness and good helth plays a verry importent role for taking enjoy because if your fitness and your helthis not good  then your mind will not able to enjoy properly .because during youg age generely  we are fit and have a good helth but duiring old age, people start problem with helth .Because a good helth  have a good mind ,in old erage we can"

Too much cars will cause traffic problem, people will not go their jobs on their time. In my opinion, in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today by the improvements in new transportation systems. 
	In future, the underground transportation system is going to improve, as the construction technology is improving. It is going to be easier to build new tunnels for the subway in every part of the city. The number of the subway station will increase in future. As a result, people can travel easily around the city. For example, in one station there will be five or more lines, which will have different directions. In cities, people prefer to use subways without having park problems, traffic jams, taxes. Also, the resources of petreloum is decreasing everyday, so prices are increasing and cars become expensive transportation vehicles.
	Second reason for not using the cars is going to be the scooters. As the improvements made in the electricity engines are applied on the scooters. For example, the segate scooter was started to sell in market and people interested in. In twenty years people will be using scooters instead of cars.
	Third tranportation vehicle is plane which causes in the fall of the cars in twenty years. As the technology is improving, in future the airplanes will be cheap, easy to fly and small. So, people can buy airplanes. For eaxmples, airplanes will take off from the roof of houses and land on where the people go. Also, airplanes will be much more fast than cars. As a result people will travel quickly.
	To sum up, in future there will be alternatives to transportation with cars. So, people will prefer new tranportation systems which cause a decline on the number of cars in twenty years."
8078,0,"It is sad to say so, but I am afraid it would be completely the opposite. Not only there will not be fewer cars in twenty years but there will be more cars that our roads, fuel resources and specially, environment will be able to take over.  It seems that in these days everybody has a car, new, second-hand, blue or red, compact or station-wagon, whatever the shape or model, when a young man or woman reaches the appropiate age to drive, they get one car. And this is specially true in the case of USA, where a person has nothing to do without a car. Everybody gets a car as soon as possible, not only because it is cheap. Also because long-distance communications throughout USA may be really good, but that is not the case when it comes to short distances. 

Moreover, when you are driving, if you take a look around other cars next to you, what you see is that most cars are only filled with one person. Maybe most of the people are heading towards the same direction, but nobody agrees to share the car, which will result into less fuel expense and from that into less air pollution. 

My opinion is also based on the fact that public transportation is already well developed, except in cities where there is a possibility of building an undergrown net. I do not see any future perspective of  an alternative vehicle but who knows what will happen in twenty years. Those futuristic films where we could see spaceships floating on the air seem to be very faraway.

It is true that every day there are more low-cost airlines that provide very cheap flights. But cars will never be replaced for short-distance travels. There will be more and more cars and this will have a terrible impact on our environment which already damaged by the pollution that cars produce. The best thing would consist on finding a new type of fuel, based on natural components instead of petrol, a new efficient and friendly-environmen"
3197,0,"Personaly, I prefer to learn broad knowledge, and I believe that broad knoledge would be helpful for a person anytime. Therefore, I agree with the opinion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specipic subject.
    Of course, I guess other might explain equaly valid for learning one specific subject only. In fact, I am planning to enter the PhD course in a guraduated university. For PhD study, we need specific knowledge and it is better to know specific research area deeply than to know wide area thinly.
     However, even if I consider the above goodness, I believe that it is better for all people to have broad knowledge of many academic subject. Why I believe this is follow:
     First, I think all most all people do not deep knowledge so much. On the contrast, broad knowledge is neccessaly when a person face some troubles which are unfimilire to solve it. Whenever we live, we can not do well if we do not our various knowledge. That means we are children. A Child can not live alone if their parents do not help her or him.
     Second, I believe that it is essential for researcher also to have wide knowledge. For example, when I could not write a research paper well and stoped my idea, I will read books or watch TV. Sometimes I can get useful idea from media. In addition, if I have broad knowledge, I would be able to discuss the problem on research by various aspects. That's why I prefer to learn wide academic subjects.    
     Considering the above all reasons, I agree with the opinion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specipic subject."

 From younger people, what the olders do doesn't look so enjoyfull. I think that is because youngers have many things diffrent from the olders have. Like strenth and ideas they have. When a younger people spends a day, they can do lots of diffrent things. For example, they can do any sports they want to do like soccer, tennis and any things even hard sports like american foot ball. But when a older people spends the day, what day can do is limited. For example, they can't do hard sports that move around lot, they can't travel as much as the youngers and lots of ather things and what they can do is like sleep, have some walk, have a chat with freinds, stay home and somethings like that. When  people look at this and had to choice from two of them, I think allmost all of the people will serect what the younger does because it looks more intertaint then what the olders do.

4158,0,"I agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they alerady know how to do well. Because success is usually associated with new things and risk-taking, although some successful possibility is in what's already been know to do. If you want to succeed, you have to get attention and attract people, and you have to get out of the old and current tendencies.
     First of all, trying new things might be risky to succeed; however. when you think of big business, you have to be imaginative and creative about what will be the next trend in the society and what people need. People always want to try new things and keep the good things about new; therefore, doing something what have already known or done will not change your life drastically. You don't want to reapeat the same things that someone have done before. That is not the demand of people. They need something new, exciting, and amusing. If you want to succeed, you need to try new things.
     In addition to the new things, you take risks if you want to succeed because taking risks will be always along with trying new things. Although  you are not sure if this will be accepted among people or not, as long as you are in the secured fields which have already known or done, you will never get a chance to succeed, or you will have less oppotunities to succeed. Taking risks sometimes might cause a big damage, but it might give you a huge success in your life. 
     Therefore, trying new things and taking risks are always together, and they are something people have to follow if they want to be successful. All in all, there are so many successful people who try new things and take risks, and it is important for people who want to succeed to t"

When  I did not attend to the class I was stud?ng  before the exam, Actually I d?d not learn subjects in detail just knew what they were. Thus I passed all the classes with high grades. When I came to university I recognized that I d?d not understand many concepts well. I have just known the names or dates but why they are important is a question in my mind.

What has given birth to this never say die attitude? the normal conclusion will be that its the new generation that holds in its hands the reigns of a powerful and majectic nation. The pertinent answer to that will be yes the youngsters are responsible for its community. I totally disagree to the statement 'that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities'.
I am of the same genre that we talk about here. I would ask how have I not served my community? I have taught in blind school that exists just beyond my college, who had forced me to do it ?, nobody. The reason why I did it is the fact that I think I am responsible to keep everybody priveledged or underpriveledged at the same level. Infact I felt that this is the least I could do to help those who are less fortunate than me.
As a rule I don't believe in giving alms, I feel strongly against the notion that any able bodied person should beg and not work. That is what I do, I work,I contribute to the economy, I work, I pay my taxes on time, I have the will to see that my abilities are used to the fullest so that I grow, in turn my agency grows and that will in turn make my economy grow.
If somebody feels that I stiil have not contributed enough to my community then I must add that my community holds adults and children. I love and respect both. Not only do I spend time with them, I stimulate others to spend time with them too.
As an onset I would finish with the statement that I do contribute to my community and I am still counted amongst 'young people'. I will continue doing this because I don't have a point to prove but the fact that my conscience asks this out me and this is the minimum I can do to make people who matter to me more special."

However I think also that the cars bring with them same ambiental and social problem.
First of all, the cars make too pollution, also new cars that they have so many reststriction but again today is not enough.
Furthermore, the cars have destroed all kind  of human ralationshipm whit nature and otherelf. For example, for getting some at market the people get their car also to do few meters, because, so they do less work. The people don't want to walk or ride a bike anymore because they are to lazie to do that and they think that the car can solve their problems of moving.
This abuse of the car is allowed becouse not only for the laize of the people but also for the bad condition of pubblic traspot.Indeed, in some part of the world, it is always late, durty, and sometimes very expencive, and above all confortless. In other words, these are situations that force people to take the car. Indeed, it has all confort that we want: air conditioned, music, space...
I don't belive that among twenty years the car will be fewer, instead I think that the number will grow up more and more.
This will be possible because a wrong political way hes been gotten ( I am talking about my particular country situation) .Nothing is doing to change direction.
On the other hand, somebody thinks that the end of petroil will decrese the number of car, but for my it is not true,for to topic: the oil is still too much to finish suddenly and the cars' factory never will allwe the the car wil lose importance in our life.

34,0,"Over the last 2 to 3 decades, the number of cars in all over the world has been increasing rapidly due to development in its technology. Howwever, in my opinion use of cars would be decrease in twenty years, becauase of a probable shortage of petrol, introduce of tough provision for global warming and the possibility of invention of anothee types of behicles. The  following essay explain to support my perspective in more detail. 

To begin with, the amount of gas and exhaustion emitted by cars are crutial when it comes to addressing reduction of global warming and air pollution. Many governments nowadays promote poeples use of pubic transportation for commuting. In near future, it is likely that several nations make policies and procedures for that promotion, the aim of which much be to decease people&s use of cars.

Futhermore, petrol price has been becoming higher and higher because of the shortage in the near future. Therefore, It seems that people will have to begin thinking about another types of behicles, which do not use petrol. At the moment, several car canpanies have  tried to create electric cars, but still it is too pricy to target ordinaly people. Remarkably, some of the companies already started improving the techniques to creat other types of reasonable behicles.

In conclusion, I belive the techniques and environmental concerns about global wraming will be promoted by 2026. Use of cars  might shift to newly produced behicles. Hence, this is predictable that the ues of cars would decrease than we use at present."

     The second reason why it is more veneficial to students to learn facts lather than ideas and statement is time.
Students can use the time more usefull.If student understand ideas and concept for each facts,they have to spend so much time and energy.For instance,when I was elementary school,I learned mathmatics formura without concept.In order to remember all the formuras,the teacher gave us a song for the formura.Thus,we can easily remember this formura without spent exstra enersy and time.,and it is still usefull to me.

8932,0,"I agree with the statement that one should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than specializing in one specific subject.

I believe in being ""jack of all trades and master of some"". We should aim to increase our competency in the subjects that interest us, but should also have broad functional knowledge about the other subjects. This will also enhance our capability to integrate various subjects and arrive at a solution to a problem. It is because, in the present world scenario, the distinction between various subjects is becoming increasingly ambigious. There are lot of topics that are related to more than one academic subject. Our real world systems are also mirror this ambiguity. Fuzzy logic and programming IT domain are two concepts that address this fact.

A person is also expected to be adept at handling more than one kind of issue. We are looking for people who are versatile and who have a variety of skill sets. For instance, managers are expected to understand market dynamics, organisational hierarchy, strategy consulting and even do performance appraisals. Similarly, in the IT industry, we are looking for good programmers with 'domain knowledge' in more than one field. If a person restricts himself to specialisation in one subject, he will be completely ignorant about the other subjects that may have a critical impact on his daily life situations. Also, he may be missing out on some interesting facts related to the other subjects. 

A broad functional knowledge of many academic subjects also increases our ability to comprehend a problem and arrive at a holistic solution. We will attain a deeper understanding of the workings of various systems, both natural and man-made. Then, our thought processes will also tend towards analysing a situation, integrating our knowledge of various subjects and enabling us to be more imaginative and innovative.

To put in a nutshell, a broad understanding of many academic subjects will make us become better solution providers and all- rounders in most walks of life."
8369,0,"At school, at university (...), we can see lots of students who have either broad knowledge of many academic subjects or a specific subject. We can wonder what is the most important of these two issues for a student. I will answer to this question in two part and explain the best issue for a student.

	On the one hand, it is a good idea to be specialized in a specific subject because it means that the student is very interested in a subject and can continue this one in postgraduate studies and maybe have a fantastic job related to this subject. For example, a student who is only specialize in economic can improve his level thanks to a PhD and why become an economic teacher or a economic journalist... So, it can be very interested to have a specific subject where we are very good. Moreover, being specialize in a subject means that the student must have very good grades, hence am accomplishment for the student who is fond of this subject.
	On the other hand, I think it is a very bad idea to be specialized in a subject and it is much better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. Actually, a student specialized in one subject must have very bad grades in the other subjects whereas having broad knowledge in lots of subjects allow to the students to have mid or quite good grades in all the subjects. As far as I am concerned, I prefer having arround 12/20 in all the subjects than having 18/20 in a specific subject and 8/20 in all the others. I think a good aplication form must show that the student is polyvalent and not good in one subjects and bad in the others.

	Finally, I qgree with the statement. It is, of course, much better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject."
1122,0,"I totally agree with the sentence.If you do not try new things, you gain nothing even you suceed in getting what you want,as you have not gain any expirence in the process.

   Columbia will not find America if he does not dare to sail out to the strange seas neither will we know who he is now.We can only get real success if we do the things in our own way not to follow others.

   This quality should be in everyone's mind especially those doing business, if you do not dare to invest where can you get your gain? It goes the same in every thing , life is  doing business,we should dare to invest smartly and only by doing so we can gets the gain,the experience.This prove the saying no pain, no gain.

   People always like to follow the steps of other people, without thinking if you are really suitable for it.A specific example the choosing the courses in the university, you can do a survey and check to see that how my percent students choose their future according to their own likings,I think about only 10%. Most of the students follow the instructions given to them by their parents,they do not dare to disobey them even though the course they choose is not to their likings
   
   Some might say that the adults or the people done before knows what is right or wrong ,the are experienced and knows what is the best,it is true that they have the experience,however it is the experience of their not our own ones, inorder to really learn things we need to learn them the hard way, go facing the problems on our own, do not be a coward.
 
  Another example of a successful person who suceed in what he is doing by trying is Bill Gates the world richest man.Will he be rich if he does not dare to introduce Windows to the world?I doubt so.If you wants to be as successful as Bill Gates,dare to try."
11081,0,"In my opinion, understanding ideas and concepts are more important than just learn facts. Just learning facts could bring few problems to students.
	First, if students just learn about the facts of any topics, they might forget them very easily, some students might not forget, because not every body has same style. However, if they don't understatnd ideas or concepts, they will forget when they don't study facts for a while and try to study again. It is why understanding ideas is important, if they understand ideas and concepts, they won't forget them easily.
	Second, it is very hard to learn facts without understanding ideas or concepts. Especially, for young students like elementray to middle school, they need to understand ideas before they learn facts, because most of thing they learn in school for example are the stuffs that they never heard about. Therefore, if they just learn facts and not understanding ideas and concepts, they will get hard time in later like high school or college, even they still remember the facts.
	Third, they cannot discuss about the thing that they learned, if they only know about the facts, because they wouldn't know what they should discuss about, for example, students learn about the facts of soda, they can't discuss what are the pros of soda and what are the cons of soda. They only know that what is the soda.
	To get better knolwedge, those are the why they should understand ideas and concepts of the topic they learn. However, I would like to say the facts are very important too to know things, because students could know specificaly about the thing they learn with facts. Therefore, My opinion is understand ideas and concepts are more important and the first thing to get before learn the facts."
11899,0,"In University, students have both to undestand ideas and concepts and to learn facts. In my point of view, these two things are totally complementary in a student learning-process. 

	It is true that, depending on the area of studies, it is sometimes more important for a student to understand ideas and concepts, or in contrary, more important to learn facts. 
For example, a student in History will have to learn a lot of facts and dates to be able to talk about a war. If you don't know these, you are not able to explain them. Learning facts happens first, and understanting ideas, after.

Mathematics or even Economics students would rather say that it is more important for them to understand a theory or a concept than learning facts. If you understand an idea you can thing about it, re-use the idea, or even learn from previous mistakes than have been made in the past. After that, it could be interesting to learn when a theory has been though or where. 

Moreover, if you understand something very well first, then it is easier to remember facts about it.
For instance, when I was in high school, I had lot of difficulties in learning facts and dates in History, especially concerning the Cold War. After speaking to an older student, I realised that I wasn't able to memorize the facts because I didn't understand how it happens and why. After understanding something, you sometimes remember everything without ever noticing it. 

In my opinion, understand and learning are both important for a student. However, during all the years of studies, students have to learn to think, to take decision, to learn from mistakes, not only in order to find a job, but also in their everyday life. Because studying is not only being able to learn facts but it is also the development from a child to an adult, I agree that understand ideas and concepts is the more important."
3314,0,"In my opinion, a man should have a specialized knoledge on one specific subject. The reasons, both including social aspects and individual aspects, are illustrated below. 

For the social aspects, today, more and more companies require a person to be armed with a spefical knowledge. Only by doing this can help companies stay competiable because those people is the ones contribute a lot to companies by using their strong knowledge. For example, if a person who wants to go to Intel to design CPU chips, then he needs a strong knowledge of Electronic Engineering and helps Intel stay advaced all the time. There is no reason for a company to hire a person who doesn't have any specific knowledge, because every people has his specific job in the firm. Even more generally speaking, companies, as well as our society, need those who have a specific knowledges to make changes in this world and let our world become better.   

On the other hand, from an individual point of view. The more he devotes himeself onto a certain subject, the more knowledge he will get. For instance, he who feels like studying law might have the change to understand his career direction earilier than others. This helps him to stand out of crowds and becomes sucessful in future as soon as possible. Bill Gates is just a vivid example, who loves computer science so much that even decided to quit school when he was only a college student. Later, he built up his career as well as this world's honor: Microsoft. By the same priciple, a person who concentrates on a specific subject could gain a deeper understanding on it thus broaden his view on this field, by easily meeting with a variaty of friends. Meeting people, attending lecture, or conference becomes a good oppertunity for him to even become better in this field. 

Based on those above points, I think it's better for a morden person to specialize on a specific subject to give himself a big change to success as well as change our world."
9224,0,"The issue of whether or not it is more important for students to understand concepts than to learn facts is a controversial one due to its influence on today student's education. On the one hand, learning without understanding is claimed to lead to make students only 'wise monkeys'. On the other hand, the current twenty or so generation is said to know far less than former generations and hence should largely learn class content by heart. On my opinion, I agree with the statement above and consider that understanding is a prerequiste to learning. 

The first argument in favor of my position is that understanding is a real reflexion while learning may be seen as a deshumanized task. If school education has to build tomorrow brains, it seems important that they can understand what they have been taught. The movie 'Rainman' can be taken as an example : the story is about a very smart man, able to compute how many matches fall out of a box in seconds, but unable to communicate with the world surrounding him. Students learning large amount of facts without being able to understand basic ideas could be seen as future experts jailed in a very narrow mindset. 

Then, it has to be noted that Leibniz is said to have been the last man knowing every field of knowledge. In the current century knowledge has become so vast that it seems hardly impossible to know everything in a specific field. One life is often not long enough for a specialist to lead all the research he wanted to. Hence, it makes more sense to make students able to think with concepts they understand than full of knowledge they don't even know how to combine the different elements. 

Eventually, creativity is essential to cope with an unknown situation. While students knowing many facts could in a sense recreate learnt solutions, students having understanding concepts and ideas could be more apt to deal with the unknown and to fit an acceptable solution to the problem they cope with. 

As a conclusion, I think that understanding is a prerequisite to an intelligent learning. The former may not really be separated from the latter but I think that wise advises and concepts are much more useful for the mind than a huge amount of data."
3706,0,"With the young and the old people, we have two different way to see things. In some points you enjoy more your life as a young personn than an old one, but this statement works in the other sense too.
For a young personn, life is a train that you don`t have to miss, in other words, you must enjoy your life as much as possible as a young personn, because when you get old you are not able to do all the things you were able to do before. When you are young you have a permanent energy that gives you this happiness of living that allows you to do everything, like go out on the evening and go to work the morming after without being tired, or just pratice a lot of activities like climbing, scuba diving.. For sure, scuba diving is not advize for old people because of heart problems. This example justify why being old can appears as the end of the freedom. You are more fragile, your body is not the same, you are not the same.
But being old is not essentially the end of life. As the wine is getting better when it`s getting older, people become better when they getting older. In fact, you become more confident because of all your past experiences. You become a brain who knows everything and who did everthing ! That`s one of the biggest advantage of being old, you have a knowledge of a lot of things. It`s not the only thing, when you are old you can make a comparison with the past, society changes, new products appear, you enjoy to see all the improvement of the world you used to live in before . By the same time you become grand parents, and you enjoy a lot to be with your grand children.
In my opinion, you enjoy more your life when you are young, because you are more able to have fun. When you are old you are often seek, your body doesn`t work as good as its was used to, and futhermore you just remember the past, when you were young."

Traffic is usually a problem that one witnesses almost every day. To get to a place where I could have otherwise, some 5 years ago, reached in 10 minutes, it now takes me close to an hour. However, if the government does somehow manage to curb the aforementioned problems, then the situation could be different.

Also due to better and more convenient modes of public transportation- railway, metro, buses etc,. The Government, having noticed the deteriorating conditions of traffic, has tried to do something to improve the congestion and road conditions leading to it. But our nation has seen a population boom far beyond its expectations. Roads cannot be broadened further and no more place for it can be alotted. I have noticed a shift in peoples choice of everyday transportation. Not only is it more convenient because it occludes problems of traffic, parking etc, but it also proves to be less expensive and more comfortable.

Admittedly, one cannot deny the advantages of having and using a car. Some people are very passionate about cars, buying and using them. Also, at times of emergency such as a late night need to go to the hospital or a doctor, or even for other conveniences, a car does come in handy. Besides, certain people just hate public means of transportation.

To conclude, due to an increase in the number of cars attributable to a huge population boom,  terrible road conditions and the improvement in public transportation, I do see a decline in the number of cars in use 20 years from now. Thus, in essence I do agree with the speakers assertion that in 20 years from now there will be fewer cars in use than there are today."

Now we are looking at Hydrogen like only solution for a pollution dicrease, but maybe tomorrow we can find something different. I think that the only  way to have less cars in use is the introduction of a new tax to enter in the city and a good service of bus and train in the city.  Italin people are not able to reach the work place without their car and,  I think a lot of people all over the world  want their indipendent and to be free to go wherever they want. Today we are about 5.000.000.000 people but in twenty years how many are we?
How many car will be?  If we grow up we need  more transport and more car. Now all the car are moved by gasoline, but is its price good and is its disponibility  enought? Maybe only solution to cut the car number is the end of the gasoline or a price so high that nobody can buy it. 
Some studies say that the gasoline price reach in italy on 2007 like a 1,80 euro for L, and if we think about mind salary it is easy to see how is difficult drive our car. However I think that will be very strange if in twenty years will be fewer cars in use but if we learn to go in 2 or more people with one car maybe could happen."
6366,0,"Generally speaking, I agree with the statement. In my opinion it has gotten harder for young people to get involved in community activity.
It is true that less an less young people participate in activities of their communities, but there are reasons to do so.
First of all, I think that the expectations of a young person's environment, especially parents and teachers, are very high nowadays. It is expected from a young person to earn good grades at school or at college, to participate in extra curricular activities to show a wide range of interest and many young people have to work after school to earn their spending money. There is not much time left to engage socially. 
Besides, in our society young people are told everywhere to have fun rather than being socially engaged. This raises young people's expectations as well. But I believe, that most young people cannot be held responsible for wanting to live like they are told to by the media and their environment. In other cultures young people do not experience the same kind of freedom young people in the USA have. Often they are told to take care of family members or friends, which is a social engagement as well. In the western civilisation the family structures and social connections have been weakened over the last decades, which might also be a reason for decreasing interest in social work.
So the problem of the declining number of young people who give time to help their community is overall a societal problem, that has to be dealt with, because there is still a necessity to encourage young people to engage socially.
Communites often depend on people, especially young ones, who are not paid for the work they do. Moreover, it can be a lot of fun, being an active part of a community. It is always a way to meet a lot of people who share your interests and it can be very inspiring to work with elderly people, for example.
Young people can lern a lot from them."

Mostly young people have many respondsbilities in these young ages like education,part time jobs and looking there family works even thouh young people are helping there communities in many ways directly and indirectly.
Mainly the young people help the commnity or there nation by joining the defence services for there country.
the young people were the first persons to oranganse any functions or meeting in there colonys or societies and these people only maintain all the orangements and success to activity.
When people or country were facing problems with natural cliamatics like earth quake,heavy rainfalls,or destroes mainly only the young people come first to collect the funds and gives morals support to the people and govering bobies of nation.
when an univerisies or collages celebrataing any event like collage day or any activity  the success beyond that was none other then these people 
The  young people were good in helping the people in remote areas by giving knowledge for them in education and promoting goverment projects and programs in development process.
people now a days were aslo partisprating    in many events which were  relating to social and economics factors ,mainly  in social activities like  helping the poor and   old people in homeges and giving lot  of  support to these people who  were in  need.
espeaicaly the young scientics and software enggineers were becoming backbone  to the nation economy and development  of  nation .In many communitical actives like marothons and  sports events  only the young people were getting  all the  pretiege to nation and communities .not only these many events like protecting commnity from cleaness and emplyment all thing were  going to be done by the young people .
So my support  to young is always good  and its  good to nation ."
3619,0,"I agree with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. 
  
        This is seriously observed in urbanised communities than in rural comunities. The possible reason why young people nowadays spend less time in helping their communites could be their tight and hectic schedules. The education system these days is really challenging the students. It is not that easy to get through such a process of education because of the severe competition among the young students. The students cannot afford to leave the education system responsibilites for the sake of community requirements. if they dont concentrate much on their education they will have to regret at the poor grades they score and the poor performance they had given. This would affect their future. They wouldn't get enough or suitable employment opportunites. Usually, a student with good educational qualifications get enough opportunities to lead their professional life satisfactorily. 

       The other possible reason could be the change of mindset of the students these days. The present day students lack the quality of helping nature. This could have been resulted from the severe competition from their counterparts. So, students have turned selfish. They dont show concern for the development of the fellow-student because of the fear that they might overtake. For example, in a university there are limited number of seats. Obviously all those who are aware of the fact keep it confidantial and do not show concern for others because of the fear that the university seats get exhausted. A similar kind of attitude is more seriously observed among the employees of a company. An employee is reluctant towards his co-employee or he doen't show any concern to help him because of the fear that the opther person might overtake. The reason for this kind of behaviour among the people is the lack of enough number of opportunities.

      So, for all these reasons, the pesent day students neither concentrate much on community affairs nor contribute for the community welfare."

in my personal case without import wich is the objective of my travel, I do not like to travel in with a tour guide, because for me a travel is a moment to enjoy with the people that you want and I am sure taht a tour guide is not always a great person. for thi the best travel for is atrvel with a schedule but without nobody taht say what do you have to do, is tpo said travel without a travel guide. altough for me is important to have someone that in the palce of my travel can help me if I need somethin of if need help, but ths person has to be only for the moments that I need or I want is to say not a toor guide.

7910,0,"I do not agree with the idea that  it is more important for the students   to understad ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.
    I mean  understanding  the ideas and concepts will help  the students in some ways but this will not be enough for them to learn the things elaborately and accurately.Learning the facts in an operational way is much more better for the students than only repeating some concepts in the textbook or memorizig them.I think all the classes  should  should include an application part of the lessons which is given in it. Imagine that you are  in a biology class  and learning the anomal behaviours .Will it be satisfied for you to read the passages in the text book ?Of course not .It will be  better to see real life patterns on animal behaviours to learn the concept adequatly and accurately.So in such cases students might visit  a zoo or a national park by the control of the teacher in order to see the real life facts  in a natural way.Another good  example could be a  computer science class.We all know that   computer programming is an operational thing and the best way of learning it is to use the computers in the computer labs.You may use the textbooks again to understand the concepts but that  will not be enough to imagine the proggramming in an excellent way.You should use it and learn it by making mistakes again again much more better than reading its usage in the text book.
    Another cricual  point  on this subject  is the fact that it is already proven by the educational   psycologists that learning the things by real life experiences is much more effective than learning the ones which are   previously prepared  by the teachers.Suppose that you are making a cake from a cook book.Will your cake be excellent in the first time or will it get better by the time you make it again and again?"
6774,0,"I believe that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. Obviously some young people do, but not enough of them.

First, I believe it is very important for young people to learn compassion. And what better way to understand what compassion is than by practising it by helping your community. Adolescence is a shaping time for a person. It is probably the best moment to learn to help others. By doing so, young people learn to become mature and good adults. Many wars have probably been declared because adults leading a country had not been sufficiently exposed to helping others when they were younger. Therefore, training great adults is only possible by training young people to help their community.

Second, if young people were spending more time helping their communities, they would be better integrated in it and they would show greater respect for their elders and neighbours. We can  observe many examples of what happens when young people lack respects for their community in most developped countries nowadays. In France, early 2006, sworms of young people from the ghettos around Paris and other large cities burnt cars and broke into shops. This young people do not spend time helping their community. Instead, they commit petty crimes and spend their days doing in their ghettos. It is difficult to imagine that nobody needs help in those areas. Another example are the gangs in many cities in the US. There, young people spend their time killing other gangs rather than helping their community.

Third, in my experience, very few young people actually help their communities nowadays. If I count how many people have been helping their community among the young people I met so far, they are very few. I guess that the lack of incentives and the continuous pressure of our society tends to push young people toward enjoying themselves, avoiding work and taking an easy time.

To conclude, I would say that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community. However, it would be beneficial for them and their community as young people but as future adults as well."
8378,0,"I completely agree with this statement. There is no point in knowing facts without capturing the essence of the ideas. This applies to all fields of study.
	As a civil engineering student in Mexico City I had to learn many formulas and techniques to solve many problems. We would concentrate mainly on structural design, having to learn to apply these methods by heart. There was not much sence in learning the formula because in the real world we are able to open a book. The real important part came when we had to understand the effects and the causes that interact with the structure at study. A good engineer is the one that really understands the structural behavior of what he is building.
	The same applies to a history student. There is no point in knowing all the exact dates of historical events if there is no understandig of the essence of the study. What good would it do if the student does not have a feel on how a culture lived, what they ate or what they thought which lead to the historical event. The dates will stay in almanacs forever but the real learning comes from understandig the ideas and the concepts. 
	Schools today tend to lean towards a more understanding way of teaching. They focus mainly on atracting the student 's attention by taking them on field trips or by having more interactive materials to teach with. Computers and the internet help to visualize and understand concepts that would have been difficult to explain without them. There are also easier ways to obtain factual information now than before. This makes it almost useless for a student to learn the facts. They have to focus on understanding the ideas and be able to apply their knowledge in real life. The only way to do so is by having the right education."
11676,0,"A person is succesful because the person has different skills than an average  person has. I believe that succesful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. Successful pople are open minded ,and they experience new things to improve their skils. 
	First of all, successful people have wide horizons, and They have no limits. They try all types of new things so these new things make the people achieve succes in their life. For instance, Bill Gates is a successful person. He had a broad horizons, and created the microsoft. He had an idea to create an application in order to improve people's lives. His work in technology made people gain some extra time  in their work. 
	Second of all, people who like to experiment new things reach succes in life.  Successful people should have new ideas, and these new ideas lead people to experiment. Experimenting a new thing let other things to come out. People with new experiments and new ideas help society to rise so these experiments positively affect the public as a whole. for instance , the turkish leader Ataturk is a successful person. He experiment new revolutions in Turkey. He brought latin alphabet instead of the arabic alphabet, and also he let woman to vote in Turkey after he was chosen as a presedent. His revolutions led Turkey to be secular country instead of being a religious country. He made changes as whole in the public as a individual.

12087,0,"In my opinion, I strongly believed that in a close future there will be more cars in use than nowadays. I support this statement because of all the thinks that I see each day of my life.

To begin, the population of the world is increasing each day. This situation is concentrated in Africa and Asia. The previsions for the future population in these counties are that it is going to growth and it is not going to stop. 

I have also notice that the number of cars sold in these countries are increasing very fats and the number of person for each car is decreasing. That mean that in a few years they are going to approuch and reach the US and Europe statistics about the number of slof cars per inhabitant.
 
Another reason why I thing there will be more cars in the future is that the cars are becoming less and less expensive due to the competiveness of the car market and of the new technologies that allows car constructors to produce at a lower price than ever. So, it is much more easier to have a car now that 5 years ago. I think that this situation is not going to change and I am sure that this situation is going to be implemented.

Furthermore, the proportion of people who lives in the big cities is increasing not only in Asia and Africa but also in Europe and the US and the percentage of people for each car in the cities is much bigger than in the countryside. So it will cause and increasing of cars in use. 

To conclude, the increasing in the population of the world and the proportion of people who lives in the cites, the amelioration of the technologies and the are three reasons why I disagree with the statement that say that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today."
6193,0,"No one can deny  that in twenty years whether there will be fewer cars in use than there are today is a hot issue which is much talked about not only by young people ,but also by people across the world .Obviously is that there is no absolute agreement on this .As far as I am concerned ,I am fully convinced that fewer cars will be used in twenty years after taking all factors into consideration .

First and foremost ,the main reason is that the technology is advancing at an amazing rate in contempory society .Therefore ,it is probably that an innovative invention of the transpotation would occured .Let us see what transpotation we already have .Bikes cars, trains ,and even planes .They both are the great invention which bring large convenience to our societies .Since they all occured in the past years ,I believe there will be more advanced thanpotation in twenty years ,so more and more people would ues it instead of cars 

In the second place ,another chief and head reason I have chosen to put here is that if an innovative invention could be invented ,the our cities would be less polluted .A reacent survey shows a fact that over 60 percent people would like to give up cars to chose another transpotation if it can reduce the pollution of the city .Consequently ,we can see ,in twenty years ,the cars  will probably be less used than there are today .

The last but not least ,a more personal reason is why  there will be fewer cars in use than there are now is we could have more safe transpotation than cars in twenty years .As we all know ,the hurts and death caused by cars is increasing as mutiple members .We must do strongly measures to reduce the rate .What is more ,the awarness of the safe will force more and more people chose the bus or trains to go to work but not cars .As a result ,the cars will become less used than today .

As a consequence ,taking the above-mentioned reasons into account ,we can safely draw a conclusion that there will be fewer cars in usu than there are today .Because the advancing technology would let us invent better transpotation ,and the awarness of safe and reduce the pollution  will make us chose the other transpotations ."
5285,0,"I disagree with the statement. I believe that older people enjoy life much more than younger people do.  There are several reasons why, first of all is that older people have more experience and can have a better idea of what they really want out of life. On the other hand, young peple tend to be undicided on what they want.

Second, older people knowing what they want, tend to be more appreciate of life  since they probably have encountered hardships to get to the point where they can enjoy life. With young people is the opposite. They do not have the experience nor have faced as many hardships (if any) in life to realize how difficult life can be.

Moreover, older people have worked very hard and have been patient enough to wait and enjoy life. It is true that young people have more energy and probably are eager to enjoy life but older people have been waiting a long  time and they can cherish and enjoy the the moment inmensely when it arrives. I recognize that older people are more skeptical and less likely to take risks compared with a  younger person so the way of life an older person might live is less intense and thrilled with emotion but and older people can enjoy their way of life as much as any young person.

Thirdly, let us not forget that older people were once young people. They can look back and judge wether they are enjoying life more at an older age than at a younger age. They probably would come to the conclusion that life is better at a older age just for the fact that they survived and reached an older age.

Finally, older adults certainly are, phisically,  older than younger adults, but they can be young adults in spirit. They can enjoy life inmensely knowing that they had a great life and that the best part is yet to come."
3151,0,"I disagree with the statement saying ""in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use,"" bacuase it is unrealistic. Cars are essential item for people to live with all over the world today, and it is impossible that people invent something substitute to cars. 
In Japan, for example, people can get around only by puclic transportation only in the major cities, such as Tokyo or Osaka. Anywhere outside of them cannot function without cars which transfer goods and people from and to the place. My family does not own a car, however, this is because we live in the Tokyo area where trains come every three minutes. This sotuation is expeptinal compared to other cities in the world, and people still have cars in Tokyo to step out of this area.
In America, the situation of public transportation is even worse. Since America is such a huge country where the population is scattered, people have to drive wherever they go. It is true to almost all the major cities, such as Los Angeles or Wahington D.C. Only New Yorkers can afford not to have cars. In most of the parts in the coutry, people cannot even go shopping or schools without cars. I once lived in the San Francisco Bay Area, which is known for its great public transportation represented by BART, yet I still wished to have a car in order to go out safely at night. BART does not run as late and frequesnt as subways in Tokyo, therefore people need cars anyway even in the city in the States. There is no plan to expand public transportation services either. Even if so, it is not realistic to accomplish it in twenty years.
This provides the vision that the world remain to need as many cars as it does today. There is nothing that can cause declining of cars in number.
Moreover, more and more country are developing its ecomony and industry nowadays. China is a good example of a quickly developing country. When the nation develops, there will be more population and movement of people and goods, which requires the cheapest means of transportation; cars. More developing counties will need cars for its development, and people who have never The need for environmentally conscious car technology will be in greater need in the future, however, the need for cars itself will not decline."
6833,0,"I do not agree with this statement.
In my opinion it is not possible to do such a statement and to make clear what I mean, I'm going to explain my point of view with some examples.
Befor I started studying medicin I worked as a Rettungsassistentin. I met a few pepole, old and young ones and I often had the time to talk with them for a while. Everyone had his own live-story and many of them really liked to tell me about their positions to live and their experience. Now I would like to describe two really sicnificant conversations I had.
The first conversation I had was with an older woman. She was about 80 years old and lived in a pension for olds. She was very sick but always with a smile on her month. We met a several times and we always talk a lot. She told me great stories about her and her husband Karl who died 2 years ago. All the time she felt absolutely fine with herself and the world around and that' s why I asked her one day what her miracle is like. She laught and answered me> Young lady, do not belief that I do not know how crule life can be, I have seen it. But this is the reason why I am so lucky. I thank good for what I have and I enjoy everyday in my life. It is a question of position.>
The other situation I would like to describe was with a girl in my age. She wanted to kill herself becaus her boyfriend left her two days ago and she thougt life would be over know. For her there were no more sense in life. 
I think this statement made at the beginning is not right. It is important to look individually at everyone!
It is a question of view!"

       well , when we compare the past and future we can expect both to be similar . in past  ,there were fewer cars  and even in future we  could find few cars , due to many reasons. in past  when car was discoverd  the making used to take  much time  and in future when making is easy and faster the presence of fuels is  less.  as in present day we find  different kinds of cars , each having  its own  uniqueness  but  all of them run with petrol  or gas . but twenty years from now  these resources might be in scarce , or else used till the last drop .
       as in present we find the population of cars comming  in competetion with human beings we might expect that it  in future it would cross us . but once the  the resources are gone all these cars go in to scrap useful for nothing  instead  increase the pollution  and causing problem to mankind. future is full of unexpected things any thing might happen , for example  instead of fuel car there might be  electric cars , [no pollution car]. these might complletly  replace them  or else people might use cycle as in past  for transport and become more evironment consious.
      scientists are trying to  develop a new kind of fuel which is made from plants known as bio-deisel, which also can be used in future as fuel. but cars they will make there way some how  or the other . and so called cars in present day  might be called with a different name  .
 
           so i say that twenty years from now we will  find cars running with electricity or  other means of fuel, but in minimal population camparitive to now."
3305,0,"I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts.

An education based on the 'why' behind many different topics will provide a holistic education to students. As a result, students will understand ideas and concepts. Students will have clearer pictures. A student will learn a few factual information while he or she is in the process of learning an idea or a concept. The student will become more creative. The student will be in position to contribute more meaningfully to different discussions with different groups of people. Such learning help student build some skill sets such as soft skills related to analysis, thinking. Also, students feel encouraged to opt for constructive environment in which the learning is based on ideas and concepts. Students feel no undue stress on remembering facts as just remembering facts are not going to help in the long run.

Instead of remembering some rules or incidents as mere facts, the student will be in position to question the existing those rules and incidents. There are chances that more new ideas and concepts will be generated. For example, recent changes such as orgnanized producers in retail sectors have resulted in better and efficient processes for the end customers.

In today's online world, the factual information is easily available. Students do not need to do any rote learning. Also, learning facts hampers a student development. Students will rely on memory for such a trivial case about which information is easily available. For example, a trivial case would be that how many bones are present in human body. There is no need to learn such facts. Instead,  once the student is aware that the number of bones can vary during the different stages of life or can vary due to some external factors. The student will be in more position to understand the reasons for such a varied number. Such a discussion based on ideas and concepts will provide more insights to everyone involved.

In sum, students who understand ideas and concepts will excel in life from the all round development and will be in position to contribute meaningfully to the socielty."

When you want to travel with the group led by a tour guide you must to be chick about every thing, like the  plane for travel with group. Maybe i don't like that plane or i neet to change something.

	If you travel with group, that is good for you to make friend and to enjoy for evrything where you go. You can see different people with you and how they do in the travel. You can enjoy every weare because they know about travel and the good place. If the first time you are traveling, that is good idea to go with group led by a tour guide to tell you about the plan for the travel. They know about every thing because they do alot time for travel. But if i want do that travel with group led i must to ask any people or friend who went with the tour guide because i need to know about the plan and about the serves.

Some time the plan for that tour guide are no good to go with thim. Look about where are you living and how about the eat. Some time they take money from the people and they don't do the peast when you travel.

949,0,"I think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.
I think that we have to ""open our mind"" to everything because we live in a global society, so we should have many interests.
A broad knowledge of many acedemic subjects could create different interests.
An interest grows through teaching many academic subjects in schools.
I studied many subjects in the secondary school, for example latin, math, italian literature, history, philosophy, biology and I appreciated many views of these subjects.
Now I have many interests and I am able to understand different point of view or discussions.
I think that a knowledge in one specific subject is wrong."
10959,0,"I fully agree with the captioned statement. As a member of young people generation, I believe that we should find much more time to dedicate to and help our communities.

The society in which we currently live put al lot of pressure on young generations in order to push them to think about their studies and their carrers. The messages that young people receive from family, school, work are not oriented to develop a feeling of the community where  they live. On my opinion, our society is building selfish people concentrated on their own interest and goals.

I am currently leaving in Milan, the business capital of Italy. In Milan the feeling of living in a community is quite disappeared. By this, I mean that we are all concentrated on our projects and we work so hard that we do not have time to think about ourselves. We all live as single people with amazingly working hours that do not allow to think or to find spare time for a community. 

This mechanins is completly wrong because it destroys the sense of community and all the benefits that a community can bring.

I remember, when I was living and studying in a small village where my parents currently live, before moving to Milan, that I always appreciated the existence of a community. We all knew eachother at that time, because the village was very small. If someone needed help, everone was willing to give their support. The families in the community were very closed to eachother. I personally grew up with many other children of other families of the communities and we were obliged to help people with some difficulties. I remember that I was teaching at that time Italian language to foreign little children, coming from Africa but living in our community, and I was so happy to be of help.

In conclusion, I believe that communities are very important for our lives. They can greatly contribute to our needs. For this reason, young people should keep alive the sense of community and make a lot of effort in finding time to help their communities. I can affirm that helping your community can be very rewarding and that life is not only made by your personal goals and career."
10832,0,"Today, there is a general opinion about the way young people enjoy their life,and this opinion tends to say that the young enjoy life more than older people do.I would say that I entirely agree this opinion,for, the fact that ,young people are young ,gives them an advantage,because  they have the strength,vitality and capability  to do things that older people cannot.For example a young man or  girl can stay up all the nigth dancing and drinking in a night club;this is something an old man could hardly do.Moreover,the age of this young people represents an advantage,for they are ambitious,they can set themselves future purposes ,in the hope to fulfill these objectives.On the contrary, the old are always filled with the feeling that they have already make their life;they are constantly  thinking about the day of their death,and that is why ,in many cases, they do not pospond themselves in the future,and adopt a dejected attitude towards life.
For all these evidences ,I do persist in believing that the young enjoy life more than the old do,though the fact that you may encounter some old people who take life as it is and live it dayly,and therefore,who enjoy it more than some young people."
5375,0,"its always good to have broad knowledge of many subjects as this is going to help the individual to deal with a variety of situations. one can always increase his or her knowledge by going through a variety of topics, so that he/she should not be naive to a particular topic. one can always improve on the basis of knowledge by going through the topic in a detailed way.as it doesn't hurt to try things in many fields of life.its always good to know about various aspects of life similarly its always good to have knowledge about various academic fields thats  why we have all the subjects when we are in junior classes but as we grow the subjects 
However,i strongly believe that one should specialize in one particular subject. but its also better to have an indepth knowledge of a particular subject, one can be a master of a particular topic as that is going to help oneself professionally. success depends on indepth knowledge and skills and with knowledge one can be master of one's own destiny. its always important to apply knowledge in one particular direction. the second step to specialization is updation. one should always keep a track on the current events on his/her field of interest.
say forexample a Pharmacist should know about all the medicines that he/she is dispensing. It is an additional advantage for him to have knowledge about the disease but he should not afford to not to have in depth knowledge about medicine as itsgoing to cost a patient his /her life.And its his/her responsibility to guide a patient about all the medicine. 
Aquiring knowledge about new fields is always good but not at the cost of one's own field of specialization.But its always discouraged to be""Jack of all and master of none"""
5475,0,"Does the entertainment and taking pleasure from life depend on the people age or not ? 
I believe  that it is basically the character of the individual the response lies on. It is true that by the age, people have been loosing their physical activities, capacities especially in terms of participating in sporting activities. 
But enjoying life is not only limited by doing sport or showing the strength of your body. As we grow up' our intellectual capacity also improve. How about reading, playing bridge, doing hobbies like medels ?
All depends on the character, and also for minor factors his or her background (education ), the environment his or her  living in (his friendship) and financial means.
If the person is positive twords the world, life itself, I definitely believe that he or she will find the way to take pleasure from life according to his or her social-economic environment. This approach is always true when we are facing with difficulties. Is it acceptable approach to leave everything aside and wait for the death ? We, human beings are thinking creatures. So we have to evaluate our circumstances and act accordingly. If we take one step further in order to develop what I am suuporting that we must creat the best condition favourable for us to take more pleasure from life."
3857,0,"According to me people only become successful when they try new things and take more risk. If a person will continue to do the same thing what he is well know for then their are less chances that he can earn more profits then what he is earning now.
           People like Bill gates or Ambani took risk and came to the position where they are now.I will take an example of my friend's father who used to sell toys on cycle. He used to get up early in the morning and come back late at night. One day he was offered a chance or you can say it a risk.The risk was to invest some amount of money in a business.If the business works then he would become rich but if it does not then he will loose what ever money he has and become very poor.He took this risk worked very hard for the business to earn  him profits. He started with samll amount of profits then he invested that profit again in the business and kept expanding his business. Today he is one of the richest people in our society.So now we atleast know one thing that without risk their are very less chances of becoming successful.
            My father is also very rich and has his own business but when i grow up i do not want to continue my father's business because im getting a platform.Im getting help from him which i do not want.I want to take risk and start my own business.It is not neccessary that you will always have success if you take risk sometimes you might loose everything but its all upon how you take risk and on what you are putting your money on ?
            So if u have the courage to take risk then you should otherwise continue the same way and do the same thing your whole life."
10433,0,"Before thinking about the truthfullness of advertisement, one has to distinguish between the different forms of advertising. To keep this Essay short I will focus on two forms, informative advertising and emotional advertising.

Emotional advertisement tries to connect certain emotions and a certain image with a specific product. For example Marlborough cigarettes have always been associated with freedom. Because of this definition of emotional advertising, it cannot be truthfull or untruthfull. People will buy a product because it evokes certain feelings and emotions. In effect the advertisement of certain products is actually part of the product itself. The reason for this is that most people would not buy a product such as a Louis Vuitton handbag if it wouldn't have an image of luxury connected to it. This image of luxury is only upheld by advertisement. Only the customers know at the end if the image and the emotions they acquired are as good as suggested by the advertisement. I do not think this can be generalised in emotional advertisement.

Informative advertisement on the other hand informs the potential customers about a certain product, in order to convince them that it is the best product they can get. This form of advertisement can of course be truthfull or untruthfull. By witholding facts about a product or by actually lying about a product it is possible for firms to get an advantage over their competitors. But in general, lies do not last very long. It is not wise for companies to raise expectations they cannot uphold. If a company dissapoints its customers they will never buy this companies products again. In my opinion companies exaggerate the benefits of their products only so much as is expected by the customers. Customers expect advertisement to be moderately exaggerated and are not dissapointed if they buy such a product.

So in my opinion advertisements do not make products seem much better than they are, because customers expect advertisements to be exaggarated."

11665,0,"I agree with the opinion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.There are three main reasons of that.
	First of all,to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects increase your potentials.For example,even if you have not decide what to do as a career in the future,you can choose any career.In addition,if  you decide what to do,companies will require various knowledge.A person who has broad knowleds has more ability to work for various sections than a person who has only one specific subject.Finally,if you have broad knowledge of many academic subject, you will get a good position in the company.A person who has a good position have to manage various situation.When he manage various situation,he is needed to have various points of view.Boad knowlede of many academic subject can help to have various points of view.

1436,0,"Knowledge is an ocean whoose depth increases as you go deeper.So, it is next to impossible for a human being to have  a complete expertise over any subject all what a person can do is have a good approach towards a topic so as to have the best available information about it.In my opinion it is always good have an idea of vairious academic streames and then cofine your study to a particular one when you have acquired a elementary knowledge of many.
     It is very important to have fundamentals of variegated disciplines, even if it doesn't relate to you. Take an example of curriculum followed by the junior high and high schools where a student gets to learn almost all most all possible fields of study right from science to econonics to languages and history. This helps to decide what field you may take up in your future.
     Having a knowledge of different types of feilds exposes you to experiments. You can use your knowledge for relating two different aspects of study.Moreover it creats channels for the exchange of idea.Else how do you expect an electronics engineer to have a discussion with an automobile engg or a computer technical. 
    We have real life examples like Leonaordo da vinci , Albert einstein. Who have knowledge of multiple feilds like science, arts, philosophy and have still proved to be geniuses  in what they did.focussing on one single aspect through out your lifetime will lead to a wan and gloomy lifestyle with less interest to learn at a point of time in our life.Whereas interactions with vairious particulars will help you discover and energetic to learn.
      Having a broad knowledege of many academic subjects doesn't not signify specialsing in all of them but it definetly boosts you to come out of the nutshell of a particular filed.learning is a process which has no ends so one must keep working towards the expansion of his 'Ken'. Expertising any particular area doesn't guarantee success neither does it hinder your path towards it, but exploirng different ideas keeps alive the desire to learn."
1892,0,"It seems possible to affirm that most advertisements make products look much better than they really are. However, one must not forget that that is the ""nature of the beast."" After all, companies hire a multi-billion dollar machinery to convince us, avid consumers, of our need to look just like the perfect models from suburbia that are used not only to sell products, but also to use our vanity and lust to lure us to buy, buy, buy.
Let me give you an example of the way advertisment companies use our desire to look great and to be desired to make us buy their products. Two days ago I went to the movie theater. While I was waiting for my movie to begin, I was bombarded by a miriad of commercials advertising all sorts of products, all the way from beauty creams to cigarrettes. After the third commercial with the sporty type advertising gym clothing, a membership to a trendy sports facility and the required pills to burn fat, I was feeling fat, grossly inadequate, and ready to run so that I could get all I needed to get on the right track. All of a sudden, a deep realization struck me: all of that cannot be real! I can exercise to the point of exhaustion, get all the right clothing, take all the prescribed pills--not by a medical doctor, mind you--and even then, I will never look like the blonde, blue-eyed, muscular guy on the screen. Don't believe me yet? Just ask yourself: how many curvacious women or Apollinean guys have greeted you at the car dealership last time you bought a new car?
Some people would like to say that advertisements are nothing but a clear reflection of the products they offer. While I am willing to concede that there is just little you can do to make a glass of milk look more apetizing than what it is, one has only to look at the ""Got Milk?"" advertisements to get the point: to advertising companies, it does not matter if what they are offering is as good as they say it is, or even if the attention of the consumer is not so much on the product they are selling but on the personality they are using to advertise it, what matters to them is that it sells.
How many times have you been moved to get the trendiest, newest, more expensive brand of clothing, cellular phone, car, etc. just to discover after a brief period of usage that, in spite of all the empty promises and alluring techniques used by the advertising company, what you got is nothing but apiece of trash? Think about the famous Marlboro commercials. How many people thought that smoking was a fancy activity just by looking at the romantic sunset with the cowboy looming on the horizon? How about the effects of smoking on your health? Care to talk about cancer and related illnesses? Obviously, truth-telling and advertising do not go hand-in-hand.
Most advertisement companies want one thing and only one: to sell their clients' products. If they need to lie, modify, or even disguise the real product or its effects in order to sell it, that is exactly what they will do. Got milk lately?"

              Firstly,nowadays young people do not give enough time their communities.They suppose that they can live alone with not communicating in this developing world. Actually we can not accuse them completely.Because in this information era when we live they are used to play computer games and surfing in internet.So they became people who do not go theaters and movies and do not participate in social activities.And these conditions help them to alleviate.


               Moreover,young people do not give enough time their communities because they think that when they could start to walk they are free.And they can do everything what they want.So they neglect their families and their friends.When all young generation did this,the world has became worse place than before.They believe that they are free and they behave how they want.If they continue to do this,this stuation does not progress and it collapses.We must be carefull when growing a child.If only we do like this,we can protect our futures and our children's

8724,0,"I completely agree with the statement telling us about how young people today do not give enough time to aid their communities. I am going to use various examples to justify my opinion on this statement. 
	In olden times, people in some way or the other had to help their community in some way or the other as there was no other occupation other than agricultural occupations but as times have progresed, both chronologically and technologically, young people do not find it important to aid their communities. People today have to be compelled to do something that will help their community, for example, schools today have community service as an essential part of their curriculum which is good as they are trying to instill values in their students but the question posed is whether the schools are successful in doing so or are students just doing it as a compulsion. 
	People today feel that helping their community is a waste of time and money in some cases but it is important for them to put themselves in the position and see the various kinds of sufferings people are going through. For example, the youth of today has enough time to fit in time for computer games and movies in their schedules but they do not have the time and chivalry to go and help the lesser privilleged people in their community. 
	Some young people, who feel it is their duty to help their community, fear aiding their communities as they think they might be considered a social outcast and people might make fun or make a mockery of them because they are doing something 'uncool'. 
	Through proper time management and a change in their outlook, the youth can make time in their schedules to help their communities and be of some positive use to society today."

      There are two advertisement  goal. One is creat a right positive image relatided to the product or company. The other is persuade person to buy a product directly.  flowlled my case was the first one.  
      When I was middle school, I saw a really cool  ice-cream advertisement. At that time, it was summer and I was very hot,. But in the TV ad, the character was riding a ski on the snow eating white ice-cream.  It was so memorialble that I can't forger that image.  From that time to now, My favorite ice-cream is that one eventhougt the tastd of the ice-cream is not cool as the ad.
      The ad make me think cool image relatided to ice-cream. When I saw the ice-cream, I came up with cool image that ad created. So it  worked.  Advertisement did a important role in this case. I think everyone has a similar experience with me. 
     The second one is more simple. Usually the ad mentions about thire product or  price. It says it is a good chance to buy it. After you see (or hear)  the ad, maybe you would like to buy it and think the product's benefit whether you are needed it or not. 
     Eventually, the truth is that advertisements make us to buy something even thought it is not good as the ad. It says"
4197,0,"""Adolescence is the golden phase of life"". This statement will definetly support my idea that young people truly enjoy life more than older people. One always remembers the life which he has lived during his early years.It is always hidden as beautiful memory in some corner of their mind.The young generation loves to face challenges, they are filled with energy, they have nothing to worry about.

Young generation truly love to do experiment with their life, this may be sometimes dangerous but they do learn alot from it.They take every event or task as a challenge and then strive hard to complete it.Even though they fail in their first attempt, they never give up and hence they learn how to live an enjoyable life.This can be seen from an example that when a young boy tries to make some device, he faces failure in the very first attempt.But then he tries to put more of his creativeness and develops new model.This is why technology is advancing with such a rapid speed and the world is getting acquainted with new innovations.

Young generation is always filled with immense energy. Taking example of various scientists like Einstein, Newton it can be seen that these people have created history because they had that unlimited energy to keep experimenting things until a final conclusion is not reached. As young people are continously doing something or the other, they are never exhausted neither do they feel lazy.This results in their better health.They do not have to be depended on those highly expensive pills nor do they have to take some medecines as a substitute for food because all organs of their body are well functioning.

The most crucial secret behind the enjoyable life that young people enjoy is that they are  free from all bondages.They do not have any load of responsibilities, they treat themselves as free lancer and plan their living according to their own benefits and pleasure.Niether they have to go to work and take responsibilities at the office nor they have to keep thinking about their home chores.They can share responsibilities but they do not have to carry it as a burden over their head. 

Thus, by summarizing all the above points and example it can be seen that young people have an aim in their life and this is the most vital reason why they enjoy living a better life in comparison with that of the old ones."
9091,0,"It's a well spread idea that in order to achieve success in life, one has to be inventive and try to develop new things that have not been tried before. We may call it positive thinking or proactive action as many self aid books and success stories like to put it.
Besides, the succes is usually linked to quantity and quality capacity to accumulate material stuff, and success people are frequently shown to be driving expensive cars, living in gorgeous mansions or consuming expensive products.
Much of it is actually a pure illusion. If only somebody would count how many projects fell through in the past for one that could achieve success we would come quickly to the conclusion that taking risk is not always synonim of success. The proof is that even when someone tries to apply a well succeded formula tested elsewhere, the result is not always the same.
Why on earth then this idea is so popular among people? Naturally there is a kind of uneasiness that makes human being to look for new pleasures and to avoid pain.  The problem is how to drive this want of change in the society, when millions of people try to evolve to a better situation. The response is that creating the myth of success, more and more people will take risks in order to draw up new possibilities, which is generally good to the person who does that but also to the group in general, as this idea is put in practice to the benefit of other persons or societies. Eventually that attitude will be positive because it will generate evolution of the group with respect to other competing groups, even if in the process a large number of entrepeneurs has heavy losses in failed projects.
Nevertheless, in order to make it work and spread into society, the estabilishment has to divert attention of the bad cases and try to get across only the successful stories."
10887,0,"I do believe that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years.

As the care are going cheaper and cheaper, many families bought the car. This directly caused the shortage of parking space. Our goverment published a new rule that increase the charge of parking. Also, the goverment also raise the fee for the annual exam of the cars. People are getting more and more care about their money rather than their convinience. My father is exactly an example. We drove our car anywhere we were goin to, though it was only 2 km away from my home. But now, everything changed. When he plans to drive the car, he will count whether it is worthwhile. Of course, this is a effective way to reduce the use of cars. Now it is, and it will.

Secondly, people are going to concern the enviroment. As so many disasters happened in recent year, we do realized that cars DO make a big contribution to the worldwide pollution. More and more polluted gases are out, and we can not live healthily. It may caused diseases such as caugh, headache and so on. We can easily hear the people around us say that take care of the dust outside, it will make you sick. Not using cares means we are taking care not only the enviroument but also we ourselves. 

Thirdly, the goverment and scientis are also devoted to set up a convient public traffic system. My father picked me up from school every day. Though I could straightly get to the gate of my house that subway or bus cannot, I had to suffer the traffic jam everyday and stay in the car just listening to the ""beep"". That's convinient, but absolutly not comfortable!

Also, the control of the population in many countries is also an important reason that support my opinion. The less people, the fewer cars. This is certainly right.

All in all, we know what is the best for us. Reducing the use of car make our lifes more comfortable. So I believe that the number of the car will surely reduce in twenty years."

One day I saw a tv show that some resarcher are trying to find enagy which are able to alternative of gus,They found out the sugger plans are able to become an enagy as gas.Moreover that does not produce pollution at all because of plants.They are testing that enagy right now and I think it will becaome popular to use.In fact one of country which has a lot of suger plans have some benefit to use that enagy for citistions rather than gus.They offer some money to get a car which could use sugger plans enagy.
Only problem is that cost much to make enagy from suger plan that I think that probrem will solve in twenty years.It should solve because we have great chemical skills rather than past.
Other reason for suppert my opinion, each countries are helping each other mostly in today.This grobal probrem should solve all over the world country together and get over.There are a lot of countries over there they might have so many different ideas.That solve this problem easiler.
Thus I have exactry same opinion that fewer cars in use than there are today  that I hope pollution will dicreace."
337,0,"I strongly agree this statement. Generally today people are more and more interested buying cars as an important necessity, and this trend does not seem to stop for the time being. However in twenty years a lot of changes will happens, such as technology will be advanced better, cyberspace will be more wider, and the concept of space will  diiffer. 

First, in twenty years, there will be considerable change and advance in technology. That means  new vehicle will appear instead of big cars. Just think of the past. When people used only carts or bicycles, they may think that kind of vehicles are essential to their life. Who could imagine cars or airplains? Similarly, we may not need cars ant more in twenty years. Totally different vehicle, more convenient, more safe, will surely appear.

Second, more and more people now can work and study at home without moving. That is because we can use cyberspace or network system freely and efficiently. People maybe do not want crowded street,  wasting precious time and taking risk of car accident any more. We wiil not need the vehicle itself in twenty years.

Third, many scientists from many countries now are working on discover more space over the earth. If it comes true, the concept of space will be different at that time. We can use only cars on the streets on the earth, but we cannot use cars in the air in other planet. In different environment, we will use different vehicles or extremely we may not need any vehicle. 

In short, I think the use of cars is just appropriate for now. A lot of changes will happen, though we cannot imagine what will be like. Cars are just the useful invention of NOW, but it will be useless after humans are sick of them. There is no limit of human's satisfaction."
2395,0,"This world we live in has always managed to find its way of a change such as what we have today: the common usage of cars every where.
To be honest i would never suspect that there will be a fewer number of cars ever, because the world isnt made to help people find another mean of transportation. unless mankind succesfully achieves the prospect of spaceships or in other words floating cars, then there will be absoloutly no dought that i will be thinking differently.
What im saying is that it will take a much longer period of time for mankind to move on and give up on the cars we use,probably allot more than a hundred years if not more.
Ofcourse im hoping that a new type of transportation mean would be achieved because cars can be such a bother,for example car accidents and parkings and most importantly car oil or fuel.Our worlds preservations are dying and its resorces are vanishing into thin air,and why do you think that is,just because we want to drive our cars.
Im sure its mankinds need for survival but that doesnt make it any less harmful towards nature.
In twenty years we will have lots of new ideas and inventions thats for sure but we are going to face an absoloutly big problem with the anormous number of cars being used and produced, the way i see it is that if we go on like this we might not manage to last for long.
I think that the cars industry is at its peak these days i mean how much better can cars get to be they already managed to create built in facilities in cars, some people can live comfortably in a car.
Cars are an amazing invention but it can be a double edged weapon if the number encreases through the next two decades."
60,0,"In todays modern time every things are developing at a very fast pace.The youth is in the fore front. But is the youth really delivering what is expected from it? Is it giving enough time to help its communities.Well i would be glad to say that yes the youth is delivering in this aspect also.The various youth organisations , active participation and awareness in varied strata's os society does make me believe this.

Firstly we see various youth oraganisations existing at all levels right from college level to society level and even state level.As it is rightly said the potential of tomorrow lies in the present, The current represenattion and efforts of the youth we sholud have no doubt in seeing a bright future ahead.

Todays youth apart from individual intersets is seen involving in issues of communities and country.The recent controvertial issue of Reservations though must not have ended but has defiantely indicated the large awareness and unity in youth.The incredible youth participation from all over the country has indicated its strong presence.

As we know youth have power both physically and mentally to bring changes and it is being tapped.We find youths entering politics which until recent was not a trend.Today we do see young individuals entering politics with a intention to improve life.Their has been realisation that youth has to have a say on bigger and imporatant issues.We have students representing countries at international level and voicing their opinions.

To those who say that todays youth is only interested in Fun and personel achievements i would like to tell them that such individuals are wrongly interpreted.Youths are generally mistaken to refrain from social funtions and lost in their own friend circles.i would like to say is that youth may have its own way of contributing to community.For example a youth may prefer going for a movie or chilling out with friends in his spare time But he may not delay in coming ahead in contributing when it matters the most.

There is a crucial phase in every individuals life where one has to focus on certain aspects of life. Thus when young one will always want to have a personal security first then think about others or society in particular.Thus for  young people at critical stage of career may seem to limiting themselves but are defianately not making them  Negligent towards communities.

I believe the community does get the inputs from young people and with the various points discussed above we can have a positive and encouraging future for sure."
533,0,"Thinking that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today is difficult to believe. With the economical situation in the world, with developping countries like China or India, the number of cars will soon grows up.

   Like I've said, all the developping countries need communication ways if they want to have a place in this world, and the car is the first key of succes. With communication exchanges are created, and the best support of exchange is the car. In our developped countries, the statistics proove that more and more people use their car for short trips. Nowadays, the high price of oil pushes the people to use less car, but in the future, new energy sources will be invented.
   The car has become a part of the occidental way of living, and it will be very difficult to change the facts. Car is also a sign of independance: the freedom to go where and when we want to. Most of european cities are built to get used by car, even if public transports exist. In a kind of way, the car is a part of the occidental culture, and the same situation can be remarked in some other continent. The car is also considered, in many countries, as a symbol of richness - and it's a really important social phenomen-. This selfish way of thinking shows very well the occidental psychology.

   Maybe in the future -less than twenty years-, the number of cars will be fewer in some countries. Those one, aware of the political, social and environemental problem that oil creates, will take their responsability and act in a positive way. It's also permitted to dream for a better future."
1171,0,"I believe that  a student should take care of both understanding concepts and lerning facts . Particuarly  I am firmly convinced that a good education should provide enough information to be learned and  enough concepts to be understood.

 Depending on the class or the study sector, one of these aspects can be prevalent but I`m sure  they should be both present. In an engineering faculty indeed a student should probably give more importance to concept understanding, while in a medicine faculty information, facts are more important. Non the less I believe that concepts require a lot of information to be understood and aslo facts can be learned after having understood some concepts.

I can give an examples based on my personal experience. I am a civil engineer, and of course I learned a lot of information during mu univeristy career. These information, studied in  math, physics and geometry classes, were essential for understanding how a bridge or a building react to loads  or earthquakes. 
Viceversa  a medical doctor  can make a good diagnosis, and understand what actually causes a certain deseas  only if he/she did  learn the related sympthoms in books.

Some students  give probably  more importance  to understand ideas because they find understanding easier and quicker than learning. Studying can be in fact boring when it requires too much time, but i think this is not  a good approach for reaching a good culture and especially for having  an effective background education. 
As student and worker I am convinced that  what we understand and learn in school or univerisuty i s the key factor of our future success in life. Particularly I don't see any chance of success for all the people that learn everything without understanding also something, because they would not be able to adapt their knowledge to the reality of their job. Viceversa, and in conclusion, I don't think that a person can do a good job if she/he has not a sufficient background of information learned in school or unveristy."
2434,0,"Today, cars are an important object of our life, it has become one of the bases of our life and a great means of transportation. It is also a symbol of freedom and independance for both young and older people. But with the progressive disparition of crude oil, we could wonder how it will be in 20 years. To answer this question, I will see in a first part that there are no signs showing a decrease of cars in use and in a second part that there will even be an increase of cars in use but different cars.

Fisrt of all, I don`t think that there will be fewer cars in use in 20 years, I mean 20 years, it is nearly tomorrow; the situation cannot change so fast. Nowaday, we are in a mass consumption society, which consommates a lot of all materials objects and especially cars. A statistic have be done and shows that cars are not a familiiy object anymore but are now an individual good, so it proves the increase of cars bought. Moreover, in 20 years there won`t be other means of transportation as developped as the car is nowaday. there will be new cars but still at their bgin. Today the scientistic research cannot propose a means of replacement to the car. 

At the contrary, I think that the number of cars in use will still increase for some decades, but it won`t be the same cars that we have today. Everybody knows that there are less and less oil in the reserves, that pits are going to be empty in some decades and that the price of crude oil is always and steadily increasing. But all this facts don`t mean the end, the death of cars. It only shows that we need new sources of energies and new ressources, such as water, sun, vegetal elements. We are only mooving to a new type of car, a new age. Today, there are already test which are made for new cars but it is not developped enougn to be sell and use. There are some prototypes of cars using water as energies but it is still a begin.

To sum up, I don`t agree with this statememt; at the contrary, I think that there will be more cars in 20 years that there are today. There will certainly be less cars using crude oil but more and more cars using new energies"
9118,0,"I do not agree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today. There are several reasons for thinking so.

Globally speaking, the transportation media is not changing for a long period of time. We have cars, airplanes, bicycles, motorcycles, trains (above an under ground) ,ships for providing different means of transport. Cars are the vehicles that are commonly used for private transportation. They provide people privacy during their journeys everywhere and privacy is something that man wants to have especially during transport. 

Also there are other social criterias that force the usage of cars. The first thing to mention is that it gives its owner a social state. Owning a car means a higher standard against the ones that can't afford a car. So it's in fact a sign of wealth in most of the world.

The use of the cars is not directly related to the purpose, -transportation- there are many other factors. One of the biggest factor is the car manufacturers. Car manufacturing plays a big role in the macro-economy. If the manufacturers are still making cars, then someone should be there to buy and use it. 

But if the manufacturers can find a different way of gaining money, like manufacturing sci-fi vehicles that can be used instead of cars then the number of the cars that are going to be used in the future will be fewer that the amount we use today.

One other reason that we will not be able to help ourselves using cars is that there is still huge amount of resources around the world. Most of the cars today are running with gas, and the earth still hasn't run out of it yet. Maybe in the future when the gas resources will dry and new kinds of energy will be used in different types of wehicles. 

To summarize, there should be certain facts in order to predict that the usage of cars will fade out in twenty years. But we don't have those facts now."
371,0,"I am agree to young people enjoy life more than older peple do.  
	Young  peple have a lot of power and enagy.  If they don't use those for enjoying life, I think that is very wasting way.  They should use those in young age.
	Now I am young.  I am a high school student.  I think I enjoy my life more than older peple. To go somewher with my friends, to go shopping with my family, to chat with unknow people on the enternet, to drow pictures, to finght with frends, amd more whatever.  Some of there are needed to young power.  Some older people can do these.  But when I become older person, I think I can't do these all.  Because I will lose power.  I might be tired early.  I know I will become like my thinking.  So I have to enjoy my life now.
	However, older peple enjoy their life by using money.  They go to big trip,  to get houses, and to eat rich foods etc.  This enjoyment is defferent to young's enjoyment.  They want to relax.  They won't to use such a enagy.  I think our feeling of enjoying and their feeling is defferent.  They are enjoy ther life, and we are enjoying our life same as the others.  If we are enjoying by defferent feelings,  I cannot say which is nice, or bad.  All peple enjoy their life.  I think that's very nice.
	Anyway, I hope to enjoy my older life in the feauture.  And I would enjoy now too.  I should play more.  When I become an adult, I will think ""I had to do someting more in the high school!  Why now my life is so busy?"".   I don't want to say so. So, now I am trying to search more fun things!  I want to enjoy more my life."
6719,0,"Advertising has always been a interesting discussion topic for the people. some people think that advertising is not very effective and does not do any wonders. on the other hand, there are also some people who think that advertising really has alot to do. and I think, I would be counted in the second group.

Advertising may make anything better by the a good picturization of that product. the better the picturization, the better would be fascination towards the product. and looks matters alot.for example, we go to some coffee shop and there we see alot of coffees and all the coffees are totally unknown to you. which one would you like to have? certainly, that looks most appealing to you. isn't it? that is where advertising comes into the picture. Its magic of advertising. 

Advertising enables us to show the good sides of anything. as we all know, that anything in this world is not perfect. all the things have dark sides too.so with a little help of advertisment, we can highlight the positive points of some product and can hide the negative parts.
for an instance, lets take example of cold drinks like, cola, pepsi etc.  these drinks are so popular among the people.but the question is why are they? while we know that these drinks are not good for health. even then they do a great deal of bussiness all over the world. Credit of this should go to the advertising. advertising totally hid the negative effects of the drinks and made them popular.

Nowadays, even some schools are providing training for how to do the advertising. these schools considers advertising as an art. and we all know that what art is for. yeah, to increase the beauty of something. and thats what an advertisement does. advertisement increases the worth of the product. 

 A coin has two faces. now, it is upto us how we are going to show it to the others. Advertising not only tells us how should we present something , but also how to present it with even a better looks. In conclusion, advertisement enhances the worth and beauty of the products. and that make people buy them."
7238,0,"Will there be fewer cars in twenty years from now? My instant reply is no, and mainly because I realize how our technology are rapidly advancing, and cars will change, changing only to make people love them more, satisfying urges for beautiful car models, creating more desires to own one. Looking back into the past since cars were first invented, there's a huge big differences of how much cars are own. Compared to before when only the rich owns cars, cars nowadays are getting cheaper in price, considering the amount of second-hand cars being sold and how cheap it is to buy one. As time pass, the rich will continue to buy more cars and selling their old ones, and at the same time, the lower class will buy these used cars for a cheaper price. With this cycle going on, more and more people will be owning cars rather than selling them. 
	And why are the rich buying more and more cars? Generally it's because of the constant change in the car technology; the desire of speed and unique designs. A stereotype view of rich people are people who buy cars just because of its looks. Car companies looking at this, will exploit this point by coming up with more and more uniquely designed cars. There's a rare chance rich people will disappear and their interest in buying these cars decrease. On the other hand, there'll always be the lower class people who are ready to buy these used cars at a lower price. 
	Most of the people wants to own a car, and in my opinion, this is a psychological desire; jealousy. When a person sees another person with something they do not have, that person will also want a car. When a rich guy sees his friend with a really groovy car, he will also want a unique car of his own. There're always more generations joining us and with this cycle of jealousy and how the car price falls, it'll be easier for people to own cars. Conclusionally, I'd say that in twenty years, or even fifty years, the amount of car usage will only increase but not decrease. Unless something better than cars join this market and successfully grab car buyers' attentions."
7899,0,"Cars are everthing in this world they have now become the only way of trasportation in land. This does not mean that cars are always going to be with us. In my opinon due to low oil production in the future cars will suffere in demand. Also in twenty years from now other kinds of transportations may be developt that may under take the car industy. And also cause of oil prices cars will not be used us much. We have to face the truth, that cars may not always be wit us.

	Cars in the present day work with oil. Due to oil foling in supply the car industry is what is going to be affected the most. Becuase cars need oil, in order to work and function. In 20 years many other people would have change to other ways of transportation cause they now that oil will run out and car prices will fall to the ground. This causing less cars in use then now.

	Due to oil distuying the enviorment many people have created alternative transportation. Some other people will find in easier just to buy a bike or another product to go and work. Cars are just not perfect, and cause they are not perfect they will disapear.

	Due to oil runing out cars will be very expensive cause there are only a few people that can buy a car and but gasoline. This will bring scarcity. Due to this few people will buy cars and so causing other ways of transportation.

	In my opinion due to oil been such un important for car. The car will decrease in quantity sold. Cause of taste of people, price, and other tecnological advances in the transportation industry. Cars in 20 years from there will be fewer cars in use then now."
8748,0,"I am disagree with the statement, and I do not believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than are there are today.

In twenty years the world will look like very different than is today. In the future there will be more tecnological advantages and the companies will construct diferents types of transportations similar to the cars.  For example, will be machines that can go over the earth and watter and flight into the air, and everyone can have one, because the cost to manufacture will be lower. 

Also the people want to go far away or faster, becasue their need will change over the time. Altough this view of the future, there will be people that think in the enviorement, and the people will be prefers  use the bicycle or other transportation that don't cause a damage to the earth. 

If a can live in the future I think I will below the group that protect the enviorement, and i will prefer to have a clean air than a car. However, The perspective that I have of the future is a little negative, the industrie grow really quickly, and the technology helps in the development of the world, but also helps in the distruction. The wants and needs of the people changes, they want to have more electronic things for have an esier live. Also the time will be preciose in the future, and they need to have a car to go to the jobs and meetings in a fast way. That is way, I believe that there will be more cars in the future.

Finally, if in the future will be more cars, I can help in the construction of this transportation, and that will be something that do not damage the world. I am an industrial designer, therefore, my work  is create a positive perspective of the future and design positive things that help the needs of the people in the future."
11853,0,"On the one hand, risk is something unknown so you can never bet if it'll turn well or not, but on the other hand, I'm sure if you don't take any risk you'll never be successful.
Although some people think that success is not about risk but just a result of their personal ability, I agree with the statement because different experiences convinced me to that.
First of all, I think about history and all the mathematicians, philosophers, writers (let's think about Galileo, Giordano Bruno, Newton and so on) who often challenged the way of thinking of their age and because of that they almost died poor and alone. But what're we still studying in high school or even in a Ph.D? Eventually they were able to carry their ideas through centuries and we wouldn't ever have their thoughts and teachings if they didn't risk during their life. They contributed to create our way of thinking so they're really are among the most successful people ever existed.
Another experience convinces me that risk is an inner quality in successful people. I'm talking about all the stories we read on the Internet or books about poor people who decide to change their lifes drastically, maybe starting a new business, or ""playing"" at the Stock Exchange market, and suddendly  create an empire (didn't Bill Gates start in a garage, did he?) If there were no risk, nothing would ever been created. Now thousands of people work thanks to the risk taken by someone in the past, isn't that successful?
From my point of view, nowadays many people could get wrong on the concept of successful, it's not just about business and creating money and that's why I consider successful all the international organization's members (and every peace\maker there) who everyday challenge incredibly dangerous situations risking their lives in war countries or simply helping children with mortal diseases in Africa. That's what really makes a better world.
In conclusion I think that everyone should take his or her own risks ,maybe in what they do the best, in order to become successful considering that not any risk is worthy to take"
4874,0,"Facts are those that often people believe.If the facts are not derived from the ideas and concepts of the relevant subject then they does'nt have strong roots to be considered as facts. People are almost all fooled if they believed in the  facts in which  they doesn't have enough understanding ideas and concepts.so i prefer in ideas and concepts in which most of the facts are emerged.
     In  favour to my decision i can suggest the examples of physics area in which Newton  has made a theory that every body in the universe is attracted towards the earth due to gravitational force. This fact has not just emerged from the idea that an apple thrown up has fell down. He went deep into the idea why the came down and made him do a research that prooved their is a force of attraction towards the earth.As a result we learn today the Laws of Newton.so as far as the example is concerned i strongly believe in ideas  that led to facts and the student community should focus on that
        The example i give is the invention of electricity that Benjamin franklin has given. The mere idea that she felt the shock during flying her kite didnt led to the electricity. she made efforts to learn why this happened and she felt that their are some charge particles which are responsiponsible for that shock. This led many theories in physics and later scientists created wonders with this concept. The argument can proved in all other areas not only in science.
      Students does understand the facts unless they are projected with concepts and ideas.So unless the facts are supported with enough ideas  and concepts the facts are never facts and there will be a  black spot always if it is believed blindly"
972,0,"I think, it is absolutely necessary to understand the whole idea and the whole concept of a topic. On my opinion, only then it is possible the get the core and the intention of a topic. If students would only learn single facts, they would never receive a complete picture of a subject. They permanently would have single pieces of information but never a whole picture, they would absolutely lack an overview of everything - like in a puzzle where some pieces are missing.

Furthermore, all ideas or concepts themselves contain facts which are embedded into them, so it is not even possible to lern about an idea without learning - at least a few - facts.

My experience has shown that I have less problems to learn and to remember both, the whole idea as well as important facts and details, when I have understood the whole topic. I have tried to learn only single facts a few times, for example at maths, a subject I am not very good at. I only learnt single formulas but had no idea about how all these formulas worked together in any relationships. In those cases I never got access to the deeper sense of the materia. 

Another example I have already experienced, was when I had to learn a lot for the university. Especially in one management course there was so much content during the whole semester, I really was afraid I could not cope with. But at the end of the semester, when I had understood all ideas of the content, all information matched and fitted together nearly alone. I really was <in the topic>. So finally I could use all information I had to learn, because I knew what they were all about, I could categorize them and use them in the right way. I am sure, this would not have been possible, if I only had learnt the facts.

Summarizing, I think students get not only a better, but also a wider knowledge by understanding ideas rather than single facts."
11841,0,"I am going to explain why I agree that a variety of academic subjects is better than to specialize in one specific subject. It is important to know that I am looking at this under specific conditions. It makes a difference if you are going to work in research where specialisation is mandatory or if you want to work for a company in an other department other than research. I am now refering to people in the business that would like to climb the ladder in a company. I am going to refer on one main aspect that highlights the pros of a broad knowledge. 
If a persons goal is to have a career and to go up in a companys hirarchy it is better for that person to understand the business as a whole. He may switch from different departments and will therefore encounter several issues from many departments. That person will also have to deliver advice and solution for different problems. Of course he will also need to know where to get missing information on a topic. If he is a generalist he might not know all details of a solution or might oversee problems but he will be able to get the information he needs from specialist. As a generalist he should have enough insight to know how to prepare the input of the specialist in a form that can be understood by everyone. He needs to know how to use the information for his company and how it would impact other departments. Idealy that person will also be able to connect aspects from several specialist in different ranges and put them togheter in a good way.
As a conclusion I would say, that given specific facts,for example work,  that influence this topic, it is better to have a wider range of knowledge than to be specialized. Wider knowlegde will help carreer driven people to climb the ladder faster since they will be able to understand and handle upcoming issues better than specialists do. Their general knowledge will make them better leaders since they  know the company as a whole and do not only see it with the eyes of one department only."
4896,0,"In our society, being successful has become a necessity, due to the very strong pressure faced by the individual ever since he is a child in terms of financial, intellectual, cultural and personal achievement.
	What is it exactly that we refer to when we talk about successful people? What is it about them that we envy so much? Are successful people those who take risks and do new things, or those that stick to their domaine of expertise?

	It seems to me that we can't figure out what makes somebody successful if we don't ask ourselves in the first place how we define success. The images of success  that prevail in our society, through advertising, television or stars, mostly deal with material goods that have little to do with personal achievement and basicly reflect financial success. And even though everybody criticizes it, we have to admit that financial and material comfort are the most common and envied form of success. Consequently, we might conclude that to achieve this goal, it is smarter to find a domaine of expertise and stick to it, in order to become a well-known doctor, lawyer or scientist and benefit from it in terms od social status and financial advantages.

	Nevertheless, being a successful person might mean something very diferent, if we put in perspective the inherent social pressure and focuse more of the individual's happiness and self-achievement. Beinf successful in the eyes of the others is one thing, feeling successful and happy is a totally diferent matter, that might imply to satisfy one's curiosity and follow one's dreams. In that case, successful people are the ones who try new things and take risks, in the sense that they followed their instincts and sometimes jeopardized their financial comfort to  achieve something more personal they believed in. Of course, when these people are famous rock stars or movie icons, everybody will recognize their success because they also made a lot a money, but what about all the totally anonymous people? To me, a lawyer that turns in a restaurant owner, a businessman who decides to write poetry are successful if they feel good about what they do, no matter how they are perceived by society.

	To conclude, I  would say that doing new things and taking risks is totally necessary for the individual to face the diferent sides of his personality, but they do not always match with being successful in the social meaninf of the word."
7741,0,"In this essay I would like to discuss the statement, if there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today.

On the one hand we have to see that the number of cars increased rapidly in the past. There has been a lot of technical development during years and years. At the moment you see more cars on the streets than you did in the past. City representatives are saying that there isn't even enough space for all those cars. They're building more parking areas and larger streets.
But now we have to discuss wether this development, seen in the past will go on. I think in times of globalization the markets around the world spread and people are willing to drive cars. 
On the other hand the resource with which cars drive, namely oil, is becoming rare. There won't be enough oil in the future to make each car on the world driving. 
But as I already said, there has been remarkable development in technical research and I think that in the future cars won't drive with gas or oil but with solar energy or h^2. We will have to see if industry will be able to produce as many cars as they're required by people. 
Also we are not sure if the oil will be rare in twenty years. 
However, today it can be seen that the car producing industry has the potential to build future cars. But at the moment they gain a lot of money with the old by gas driving cars. So they say: ""Why should we build futuristic and environment friendly cars, if we get enough money with the old cars?"". 
They should change their behaviour and build environment friendly cars so that the oil won't be that rare that not everybody could drive his car resp. buy a new one.
As one can see there are many factors, which have to be discussed for a statement like that. A lot has to be done that there could be more cars in future than there are today.

Out of today's view I think that there won't be less cars in use than there are today. In twenty years there still will be enough oil to feed all the cars. Unfortunately the car producing industry doesn't use the potentials for enviroment friendly cars so that the number of cars won't decrease in twenty years and may even increase but with a longer view there will be a change on the streets with fewer cars and cars as a symol for money as it is maybe flying in planes nowadays."
6972,0,"As the competiton increased belong the companies in almost every market, advertisiment become a very important way to improve the sales numbers. Companies use a lot of diffirent advertisement techniques. Accordingly It generally causes to make their products seem much better than they are actually. 

For example when you watch a girl eating a canddy or a chocolate you probably want to eat that product as soon as possible. When you go and buy one then you understand that it is not as much delicious as you desired, but unfortunetly you have almost bought that product and this has increased the companies sales once more.

On the other hand some companies are aware of that, this will happen only one time. When you use and see the product doesn't as good as seemed in the advertisement then you lost your trust to that company and never buy its products again. So they are triying to show the true qualities of the product for not making the customers dissappointed. When they aren't dissapointed,  they always prefer to buy their products. 

In conclusion, some advertisements may show the products better than what they exactly are, for improving the sales. But some firms can think different from that and plans long time process of its activities. I think the better way is always telling the truth. In that way people can trust your company, buy your products and in the future according to the high sales' your company will most probably be a permanent company."

  It is taken for granted that everday in our life we should try new things but according to certain norns or terms which should be taken into consideration.Vaulting ambition can be destructive.The person should be practical and real while trying new things.I am also of the opinion that one should consult those who are responsible for the matter of concern and ask for their advice.
  No one can deny that the majority of successful people are luckier than timid, shy, coward and hesitant people and this is due to their courage and the initiative soul.I believe that those people,Ihope to be one of them, deserve what they get at the end.
 On the other hand those people whon are not adventurous keep stll as they are all the rest of their lives. I think that all the famous scientists belong to the first category. That is to as soon assay they once dared to try new things, they often got good results.Finally they are rewarded by immortalising their names after death as well as in their lives.
 Last but not least,I advise every one to take the risk if he wants to achieve success but in a reasonable way.Not to be rash or impitiousbut to be serene in taking your decisions.To conclude, I think that success is a direct result of braveness and app"
2150,0,"Advertisement has become a whole part of the selling product process thanks to the expansion of the media such as television, newspapers, radio. It consists in boasting the qualities of a product, and emphasizing on them. But most of the time, the product doesn't look like the one presented on television, or in the newspapers. It looks much better in the advertisement than it really is.

	Indeed, for example in the case of a television advertisement, means such as light, special effects, different angles of shooting can be used to make the product looks better, and thus more appealing to the buyer. An advertisement for food will be shot so that the product will look apetizing, but in reality, the product the buyer will find at the supermarket won't even look edible. Sometimes advertising for frozen food, will even use fresh food, instead of the real product that is trying to be sold. And the buyer is often deluded into thinking the image presented in the advertisement was representing the real product. How many times did people complain about the difference between the brochure and the product, or the difference between the one seen on television and the one standing in front of them?

	Televised advertisement can also hire people to talk about how the product has changed effectively their life, or how adequate and convenient it has been to them. But this kind of advertisement is dishonest as it lies to consummers. They want by any means sell their products to buyers by building a fake image product, and making  it seems much better than they really are but it is not the way they should sell their products."
7628,0,"I disagree with the statement. It mat be true that the group tour is a most convinient way to travel because a tour guide know a lot about the place and there seems no waste time thanks to the all well prepered plan. However I think that to travel by ourselves is more enjoyable than group tour and there are three reasons that support  my idea.
	First, by traveling individually, you can go anywhere at anytime. For example, if you go to one tourrist attraction in a group and you find the place attracting, you have to  just pass through and cannot see the place well because of the time limit. 
	Next, you can meet local people. If you are in a group tour, local people are not interested in them because you already have a lot of conpany and the local people see you as one of them. However, if you go to the sight alone, it draw local people's attention and they might talk to you or at least nice to you. Moreover since they live there, they knows where to go better than guides or guidebooks. In addition, you can know what the tradition and cultures of the region, which the guidebooks do not tell you.
	Finally, you can be independent. To travel alone is not always just a fun. There are a lot of danger around you. However you can learn how to protect yourself when you are in danger. what you learned from the dangerous situation will be helpful for your latter life."
5266,0,"I totally agree with the statement. The basic purpose of an advertisement is- publicity. And the more flashy an advertisement is the better publicity it attains. 

It all derives from the fundamental rule of business and marketing,that is, making profit. when a product is launched into the market, stress is laid on how wel it  is advertised so that it catches the attention and interest of the masses and not on how wel it is going to stand upto their expectations. So the ground rule laid for the advertising companies is to make the advertisements (or 'ads' as it is more preferably addressed) as luring as possible. And hence, most of the times the ads end up promising much more than what the products actually deliver. On quite a number of occasions the ads have been found guilty of misleading the masses. They lead people to believe how safe and benefitial the product is when actually  the safety front has been compromised. The recent decline in the number of people indulging in soft drinks after some toxic chemicals were found in their contents is a good example of how the advertisements blow the products out of proportion. In order to make huge profits every product is depicted as an ideal one but the the flaws only start appearing after a while when it is actually used for a period of time. the sad part is they prey on the most comely bait i.e. the common people. They are the one who have to bear the brunt of all the false claims made in the advertisements. 

Making advertisements is a very innovative work its true ,but it should never compromise on its ethics which on most number of occasions it does. It should always be kept in mind that in a way it is also a means of serving the people as it lets them know about the things that are available to them and that can make their lives better in one way or the other. Today most of the advertisements do not seem to realise this and are evasive of their responsibility towards the people and the society."
4994,0,"Students in schools take their courses with either their choice or what they were preffered to take. High schoolers are required to take general classes and students in colleges narrows down their subject to their major subject. Even though students will be deciding their major, they should have knowledge from several academic subjects.
	At first, students are supposed to take courses accourding to their interests. Taking courses of what they are intersted in make them work harder and it will keep the students' motivation for studying. Even though they are choosing from their interests, their knowledge still should not be based only on one specific subject. As the students study only from one subject, their knowledge will be narrowed down. Even though it is possible, it is hard to live the world and live in this society as one worker with only knowledge from specified subject.
	Getting knowledge from many academic subjects will build the basic knowledge for the students to go out to the society and work. Without broad knowledge, people could often mislead their ways and decisions. Even if the students learn from specific subject, they need to have broad knowledge. Their knowledge from other subjects will help them to learn more for their major subject because there are always connections between each subjects or basic thought in the subjects. Nowadays, it is hard to live in the society only with knowledge from one specific subject.
	The students will not know if their one specific subject is right for them or it really interests them. It can be hard to change their ways without having any broad knowledge afterwards. No one knows if their one specific specialized subject will support the students through whole life. Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects will be life support even in their jobs. 
	 For example, becoming a business man will not be accomplished only with studying marketing. As they survive in the business world, they need accounting, various languages, and psychology. These three subject will support the business man fully.
	To have broad knowledge from many academic subjects, people will have less trouble and more fun to live their life through. People will need basic knowledge because everything is connected in the modern society."

To begin with, travelling alone is free. We can go anywhere we want and have no need to listen the guides' requirement. However, If we are in a group led by a tour guide, we  have to comply with the guides' . It entirely possible that there are some places we do not like to stay long but the guide still take us to go. Then we will feel unhappy. There is no doubt that our purpose for travelling is releave stress and entertain our life. However, it makes us feel  more annoy. Then why should we go with a guide?

Besides, in nowadays some guides like to take the visitors to the place which are not really interesting place but shops to let us buy  a myriad things which are so-called ""memorary gift"". It not only wastes lots of money but also make us feel boring about the tour. To illustrate it , there is a persuasive example. last year, Jane went to Lushan in Xian Province with a lot of people, which is her first time to go there. She thought it would be an indelible experience. However, after she got there, the guide did not take them to climbe the mountaon instead of asking them to buy some photoes first. And them he also take them to a shop nearby and make them consume many things for the reason that they can symbol that  they had been to Lushan.

Admittedly, travelling alone is dangerous to some degree. However, it is obvious that it instrmental rather than detrimental to us. Therefore, with thoroughly considerating, I can draw that I would incline to travel by my own."

First of all,having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects allow us having a personal culture. The school give  to the students the capacity of studing a substantial number of subjects, so it's important having a knowledge of them for ourself, as a culture for being well prepared in general.Because I think that knowing differents subjects open more our  mind than just focus in one specific subject.In fact knowing just a specific subject is like a limitation.


Second, the knolwedge of many academic subjects give the chance to have more chance in our life.
Indeed, knowing a vast amount  of informations show your potential with other people. You are prepared and have what it takes to be considered as an efficient person.

There is several ways to support the statement that is more important understan ideas and concepts than acquire knoledge of facts. Science requiere student to think constantly and develope a critic way to think. For example, for a lawyer it is more importante to learn how to think logically than learn a set of laws in order to be sucesfull in his carrier. A set of laws can change withing one period of Congress; this will leave the given lawyer who just learn a set of laws obsolet. He will need to go to university to learn again the set of laws to be usefull in his field. Fortunately, this is not the way that lawyer learn about their carrier, most of the knoledge adquired at a law school is to think logically. Even with a cange of legislation a lawyer still been a lawyer. However, there is allways the requirement to be updated with tecnology and new researchs to be succesffull in any given carrier. For a historian there is no discution that is require to learn facts. The same concep does not apply for a doctor.  

There is allways the necesity of improve proceces to evolve with socity. This is the reason that universities develop research departments.

Thanks to the understanding of ideas and concepts student has improve the internet telephony making ship to call long distance.

   The young generation of today do not believe in words like community they embrace every person as their family member and is working ahead to help them out.for example now days a social worker is not only interested in dealing with the people of only its community but rather people of everywhere no matter if they are racially different or social status of these people differ the basic purpose is just to serve.For example in country like india where there are number of different religious group ,when a destruction happened by flood a group of sikh community went to help these people no matter these people were not of there community,religion or region.
    In todays world number of scientist are working towards dealing with environmental problems that are degrading there atmosphere.Researchers are working hand in hand not only to bring up their society but to everyone.
 There is also a vast number of young people who join the social working groups on part time basis and work at old age homes,societies for helping suferes from catastrophes and against illiteracy etc.infact,there there is a wide number of young ppeople who join the organization established by Mother Teresa on full time basis.
   Nowdays even in schools to lean students towards helping the people now projects are assigned to students for a day or two to serve in orphanages,or old age homes etc.Students organize charity functions and fairs to raise the funds and donate them to needy people.
    Infact i believe that scenario is changed now from "" me to it has become We"".People are really working towards equality and its the reason why even when a famine or natural destruction  occurs at any place people specially troupes of college going people with every possible resource reaches there to help out these people.So i think i think young people do spend their time in serving but not their only community but whole world."
8238,0,"Some pupils often claim about the fact that they have to learn so much facts on things that they are not really interested in. But this problem is sometimes only based on the thing that pupils just have not understood the ideas of the theme. Therefore I think it is more important for pupils as well as for students to get clear with the ideas and how these ideas are developed than just to learn about the facts. I agree that theory is important but all the other things should be then strengthen by practising.
	The most important argument is that without having understand the idea or the concept of the special topic that is being worked on in class it is just useless for the student to learn the facts based on the topic. In a certain test the student may can list all the facts that he has learned but does absolutely not understand in what context they are.
	Secondly, I think it is more important that the students learn about the theory in the lessons and than practice it in the world. If there is for instance a student of medicine who has always learned very carefully all the factors that have something to do with anatomy it is the best way to strengthen his skills by giving him the opportunity to have an exam on a real dead body.
	Lastly, Students may just be overwhelmed by all the facts they are supposed to learn and can therefore just forget the real content of the idea. Looking behind the facade is very important for a student so that eventually he can really cope with all the factors and of course also the problems connected with this concept.
	In conclusion it is absolutely more important for a student to understand the ideas than to learn the facts, because practise is more important than theory and students should not be overwhelmed by the facts of a certain topic."
7507,0,"I agree with the following statement : "" Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well"".

First, by taking risks and try new things, people can "" discover"" new talents and actually find out that they are good at them. 
If you are a painter and the only thing you do is paint, you might be already successful as a painter; but not as much as if you try to sculpt and you find out that you are great at sculpting. You will be twice as successful now, because you paint and you sculpt!

We have  perfect examples in the world of "" famous people"". Let's take a famous person ( such as famous realtor...Donald Trump for example) who is  an expert in what he/she does, like realting, acting or singing and who decides to take the risk of trying something new,such as producing, directing, etc...and with surprisingly, we see that this person actually succeed in it. 
(Of course, there are some who fails but most of the time, they are successful even more because they tried new things).

Another example, more personal now. We have "" friend"" in the family that is a well-known doctor. One day, he just decided to stop and to try to sell carpets. Carpets coming from the Middle-East, Asia, etc...
He started little by little but now he is one of the best entrepreneur in the biggest malls in Paris such as Printemps, Galeries Lafayettes, and others. We can definitely see that he is an example of successful people that try new things and take risks rathen than only doing what he already know how to do well such as beeing a doctor."
3640,0,"I strongly agree the idea that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. TV, newspaper, internet, color and famous artist can be very tool for ads.

First of all, TV and newspaper are very crucial tool for advertisements. For example we might watch TV at least one hour per day. This means that there is a possibility to see the ads on TV. They are just showing the products, we dont know anything about the quality of these things. They can hide everything on TV.

Secondly, internet is a very powerful for every kind of advertisements. For instance, I was looking for an apartments to live in USA when I was in Turkey. Every apartments looked to me great from their web page. When I came here, I checked the apartments that I saw ads from the internet. Everything looks different. There was a noise on the floor while you are walking. We can see just a picture from the internet. We cannot realize every properties of apartments from the advertisements.

Finally, advertisements are necessary for companies to sell their products. They would like to use different color and different famous person. Every people might have a favorite color, so they can be attracted by products.  For example green color may attract muslim people, red might attract communist people. They would not know about the quality of products.
 
Advertisements just gives us some idea about the physical appearance of products. We would not like to see every details of products from their pictures."
6731,0,"When it comes to students learning, the discussion of the issue has become a vogue during the last decade. Considering soial atmosphere today, some people hold the opinion that learning facts is more important for students is superior to understanding ideas and concepts. Others, however, contradict learning facts. Personally, I agree on that understanding ideas and concepts because it has more advantags.

Firstly, thoes people agree on learning forget a universal truth that as a old saying that ""know the smell until you teste it"". As I remember, the people popular in the society all have strong abilities that can paly a role in their work areas. The abilities can not be learned in the classes, because it needs to have more practise in the real society. 

Inaddition, another more essential factor why I advocate understanding is more importan is that learning facts without understan will forget soon. An example I can give the details of the argument: some people like to copy other's work in order to hand in in to the teacher, but they never understand what the answers mean, because they just learn to do not understand to do. Thus, they could't get the knowlogies.

Of couse, choosing the learning facts also has advantages in some extent. For example, the tescher always give us right answer that could avoid to waste of time; they also guide us a shortest way to reach the results; and they do good for us to make a better life; and so on.

But if all these factors are contemplate, the advantages of understanding idaes and concepts carry more weight than those of learning. To sum up, based on the above discussion, it  is obvious to conclude that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than learning factors."
9094,0,"I can not fully agree with saying this statement is true nor false. I think that there are a lot of successful people with different opinions about the business they do. For example am I imagining a man who made billions of Euro trough selling shoes. I can not see the point why this man should stop producing and selling shoes for something else, something he is not experienced in. Why should he risk his money and business trough trying something completly new? On the other hand he maybe just should spend his money in something new. Being a successful salesman did not just teach him how to sell shoes but how economy in general works. He could use that knowledge to build up a completly new business. The better he can handle his money, the more risks he can take.
I think it greatly depends in which category or area someone who is successful takes risks. If I would be rich trough selling shoes, I would not mind producing a completly new kind of shoe no one has yet. Because I would be used to the economy and the business, I would not be so afraid to take this step, even if there is the danger I would not earn any money for my new creation. On the other hand I would not spend any money or risk in some business I have got no clue about. For instance am I, as shoe-producer, not used to anything about food-business. The danger I could lose my money trough investing in food would extremly be increased, compared with the rate of losing my money with remaining selling shoes. What I am trying to say is, that there is, in my opinion, no general answer for this statement. I can not fully agree or disagree with it."
1723,0,"I think that this statement is true. Indeed, successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they allready know how to do well.
	First, trying something new can only be positive. Humans base their thoughts on their experience. However, if this experience is repetitive the lessons to learn from it are always the same ones. Experience needs diversity to be usefull as situations that we come across in life are always different. Doing something different from what we are used to can therefore be considered as an investment and every investment has risks and returns. For example, a painter who uses a new painting technique has more risks to fail in its tasks than if he sticks to his old technique. However, he will learn a new way to paint that will probably pay off one day.
	Another angle for this question is human nature. Indeed it is in human's nature to always take risks to improve. People improve their way of doing things by doing them more efficiently and success can be defined as achieving one's goal. People tend to perpetually improve. They find new ways to achieve their goals more efficiently. They are considered successfull by their peers. So trying new things and taking risk are in fact main factors of success.
	It is even truer today. In our society, everyone has to have the latest electronic gadget. So being new is actually becoming part of the definition of success.
	In a word, successfull people take risks and try new procedure to improve their way of doing things."

They are more advanced and infact many people opine that the youth in this generation is degrading.The fact that young people of this generation are more advanced does not imply that they do not give enough time to helping communities. I certainly not agree with the statement, ' Young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their communities'. Some of the supporting examples are explained below.
Many young people form associations which volunteer in social activities like serving the needy, building homes for the old age and the orphans, bringing awareness about dreadful diseases and conducting health campaigns in the slums.
They are the one who feel more responsible as a citizen of their country, in upliftment of their families.
Many young people give tutions to children to earn their living. This activity is in a way helping the children to learn more and be aware of the things happening. And thereby helping the society as it is popularly known that ' Today's children are tomorrow's citizens'. So the youth today is helping out in producing good citizens. I want to support my opinion by stating another example. A political association,'Lok Parithran' (which means empowerment of the humans), was formed by young graduates in my country. They campaigned in many villages and volunteered in many social activities.
Despite of hectic schedules, with several courses to learn and several projects to work on, the youth of this generation do spare time for thier communities. The young students have that zealous to do something substantial which makes them work effectively and spontaneously. They are the 'architects of the nation'. They play an important role in building their communities."
2860,0,"I agree with the statement that, in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. There are several reasons that I would like to present in support of my view.

Firstly, cars pollute. Air pollution is increasing by the day and at alarming rates. Though there are strict laws that are being imposed on the automobile industry to make cars pollute less, these laws can't prohibit people from buying cars. More people will buy cars and more pollution will occur and this, supported by reasons I give after this one, will, in say decade's time, reverse the situation and people will stop using cars.

At the present rate of air pollution, the day where the ecological balance is lost is not far ahead. Though it's being controlled by all governments, it can not be eliminated. Pollution will eventually lead to destruction of  trees and plants, direct of indirect deaths of animals on land and in water and people will realize what they are doing to the world.

Secondly, oil prices are rising very fast. How much ever the government promises it's citizens not to raise taxes, it will have to raise taxes, because it's not in the government's hands to keep them down at the same level for ever. One day, gas will be so costly that people will stop driving cars and start using other modes of public transportation like buses and trains.

Thirdly, the rate at which oil is being drilled and extracted out of the earth, is extremely large compared to the rate at which it is being produced. And the world has limited oil resources that can be made use of. It's possible that people might still use cars but use electricity instead of gas. But where will electricily come from? A large chunk of total electricity is produced from oil and natural gas products, and they are still a major source of electricuty compared to solar energy or nuclear energy.

Lastly, road space is a big issue in most cities now. People buy cars without realizing they don't have anywhere to drive them. Huge increase in traffic congestion will only make people give up cars and take the train instead, because they know the train can't get stuck in a traffic jam.

The car has long been a status symbol. There will be a stage when iFinally, I opine that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today."
5202,0,"An advertisement is something that present people new products. These products can be cars,lipsticks,foods and many other things.They can be seen in newspapers,magazines or on television. People, who prepare them, give a certain shape to these new products so that they can be seen more attractive to people.Actually, the problem begins here because this may lead to the fact that advertisements may make products seem much better than they really are.
	In order to testify the validity of this argument, it is better to analyze it with an example. A famous car producer designed a new car for people who are married and have children. In order to attract their target market, the car producers make a deal with an advertising agent. The agent prepares an advertisement that will be shown on TV.In this advertisement, the most beautiful and thin housewife who gave birth just two months ago and his very handsome husband go into their new car with their very cute children. The car, although it is designed for middle-class families looks like a BMW in order to emphasize its excellence. At the end, this wonderful middle-class family who owns this car, which looks like a BMW, lives happily ever after.
	This example may sound a bit exaggerated but this is the case that is created by advertisements. In advertisements usually everything seems in their best shape. The women,men,babies look always perfect, which cannot be realistic. I am wondering how many women, who gave birth just two months ago can be so thin as the woman in the advertisement appears.Also, the products seem much more better than their real shape. Most of the people who are attracted by this car advertisement go to the shops and think that they will have a car that is more luxurious than it seems.However, this is not the case because when they see the car by themselves, they are disappointed because the car is in reality much more modest.
	All in all, these do not mean that advertisements are not necessary. On the contrary, they are very useful for people to know new products but this should not be in the form of convincing them. Advertisements should reflect the truth about the products so that people are not disappointed."
8212,0,"I do not agree with the statement. I think that one first needs to specialize in something. Then, after this is achieved, one can interchange ideas with people who have other specialization.

Of course I do believe that while sepecializing in some subjet, one has to keep in mind which is the place of the subjet among the rest of the other subjects. And in this sense I think it is very important to have a broad knowledge of subjects. Of course this knowledge will not be deep, but just an idea of the important issues of each area.

I think that in the last 50 years scientific knowledge has grown in such a way that it is impossible for anybody to dominate all the branches of science. This may could have happend in the past, where the entire human knowledge was smaller. But this is no longer the case. So I think it is not sensible to intend to have a full and deep knowledge of all or many subjects.

Another related point is the laboral issue. I think that someone who has specialized will have greater job opportunities than someone who has a broad knowledge but has no specific specialization. At least when I read for job opportunites, all job proposals ask for specific proffessions or specializations.  I also realize this with my friends. Those who have gotten the better jobs are those who have specialized in something."
9916,0,"I`ve lived all my life in a scholar system that gave students a broad knowledge of many academic subjects only in elementary and medium school. Then, when students are 13 years old, they have to choose a quite specific area that interest them.
So I can believe that this is the best way of learning, and so this system, ho give people a perfect mix of general knoledge, and specific knoledge is very useful for future life and work.
In fact, in this set of scholar system, all students have a basic knowledge of every subjects, and then they can choose the most interesting subjects to specialize themselves.
When students finish the basic courses, they have to make a first step for their career: choosing their superior school.
Superior school are different in their main area of interest. 
This area make students free to choose the subjects that they prefere, however  going on depeening  the basic subjects studied in the past schools.
This areas are very useful for university, because if you think you will be an architect, you choose a school that have as most importants subjects design, and math.
So with the superiors schools, and  then with university, knoledge could be specializated in one specific subject.
I think that this is the right way to learn, because for having a good career, you need to be very prepared in your own subject, but it is also quite important to show that you have also a general culture of other subjects.
In conclusion  I think that it`s very important to have a general knowledge about many subjects, that composes the general culture of a person.
But I think also that is very important to have a specific knowledge on the subject needed by future work.
This is because a deep knowledge is usefull for succeding in a good career and to demonstrate being able to do your own work."
10341,0,"Advertisements should present a product on an objective way but most of them make products seem much better than they really are.By definition an advertisement should make the public buy the product and so  present only his better aspect and properties.  Moreover, since they are a lot of company producing the same product they should emphasize the properties of their product. And eventually, there are always differences between a photo or a film and the real product.

First, the purpose of an advertisement is to create a need by convincing the client that he should have this product. Therefore the product should be perfect without any disadvantages. But  reality is different. For example when you buy a computer, advertisement show you computers as objects everybody should have. You could have access to internet, a lot of information, it will simplify your life. However, they never tell you  that sometimes the computer should have some problems like virus, that by using it for buying some products on internet people could see your credit card number. All the bad aspect of the computer are forgotten.

Nowadays, in our society there are a lot of companies producing the same product. So each company have to make the difference with the others by emphasizing the properties of their product. they should show that their products is better than those of the others. For example, cleaning product for cloths all clean the clothes. but one company will show you that our product is better than the other one for several reasons such as using less product. 

Eventually, there are always differences between photo or film they made that are taken in the perfect condition to make the product seems perfect and the product that you received. For examples the color of clothes are sometimes different due to light. So you could see on the television a perfect black skirt and eventually have a grey skirt.

As a conclusion, most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are by emphasizing their properties, not talking aboute the inconvenients and showing the product in the perfect conditions that you couldn'y have. However in the way we always want perfect products aren't we a bit reponsible of this phenomenom ?"
4143,0,"In classes, students learn not only the facts but also the ""ideas"" or ""concepts"" that can be pulled out from the fact. I strongly agree the statement that it is more improtant for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. 
	FIrst, diffrent from learning only facts, if we understand ideas and concepts throughly, we can apply the knowledge to our life. For example, if we only know the fact that Franklin D. Roosevelt built New Deal in history, it's just the fact as it is. But if we understand how and why Franklin D. Roosevelt built New Deal policy and how it effected to American reneissance, we can apply to our life as we change ourselves as Roosevelt changed his country step by step in history. We can be impressed and motivated by understanding details about FDR's New deals and accepted him as American hero. Like the exampels, learning the fact is not enough to challenge ourselves. we have to throughly understand what ideas or concepts the text book provides. 
	Secondly, understanding ideas and concepts will create a new fact that can be the great resources for the future. We have to learn from history, and prepare for future. If one have ideas and concepts from history, it can be reformed to more innovative ideas and concepts. For example, Lots of designers read many articles and magazines and see pictures from design book and try to immitate it. If they stop trying in the moment they just saw other designer's ideas, the design will stay as it is now. But from the past design, designers rethink about it and create a novel complete ideas from it. ThIs is how the design  was developed and will be developed in the future. As i indicate in a example of design, understanding the a idea or concept is the first step to remodel and develop this world. We have to accept the ideas or concepts from resourses the world has now, and recreate it with more imagination and sophistication. 
	Because of this two reason, i belive understainding ideas and concepts is much more important than just knowing facts from text. To develop oursevles and the world, we have to pay attention more to ""ideas"" and ""concepts"" rather than facts."
9562,0,"It is better to have more academic subjects, because you can learn better and have more informations. This is important to have a better information about the subjects.
But if you have only one specific subject, you can better concentrated and learn only for the one.
It is better to have different chances to take one subject."
10352,0,"I agree with this statement, because the ultimate goal of education is to promote knowledge of a subject. Knowledge of a subject only comes from the full understanding of the ideas and concepts related to the topic. It is as important to know the main set of facts as it is to understand the ideas and concepts around those facts. 
In my experience being able to understand the ideas and concepts have often times help me to arrive to the same set of facts, proving that I have acquiered the knowledge necessary, but also the tools to conduct individual research and investigation. 
While it is true that there are exact sciences (ie, chemistry, physics, or math) which depent on specific unchangable facts, it is important that students of those subjects are able to deconstruct the formulas, paradigms, and algorythms that have produce such facts. This creates a deeper understanding of facts and when the researcher is faced with a problem it is easier to solve it in a succesfull manner. 
Education should not concentrate on merely facts, specially in sciences where new discoveries are happening everyday, which change the way we understand our universe.
In the case of social sciences, such as history or anthropology, where facts are the building blocks to understand later developments it is important to realize that those facts are normally told from the winning party in the conflict or the prevailing species in an environment. In these cases the understanding of ideas and concepts will help the student investigate how different events may have changed the final outcome. 
Full understanding of ideas and concepts would lead to more complete and complex research, which will help to understand our world better and not remain in a status quo where facts are unchanged and become dogmatic with time."
1886,0,"Centuries ago, a writer could also be a  doctor,  a scientist  and an economist. People used to have broad knowledge of many academic subjetcs as it is illustrated in the book Gargantua by Rabelais. Nowadays, people become more and more specialized. Let's face it, our knowledge is so huge in every academic subjetc that it is impossible to know everything in every topic.
      There is a common joke in Economics thats points out that every economist gets specialized in a very specific topic and does not know anything about the rest. It is a consequence of the specialization of people that took place in the nineteenth century. Indeed, progress has been made in many areas and the knowledge has increased.  In this respect, medecine is a case in point, people used to know very little about the organistation of the human body but nowadays, the knowledge is so broad that doctors have to get specialized to be efficient.  Furthermore, the only doctors who remain generalists can't cure everything and they often send you to a specialist to resolve your problem.
      However, a bad consequence of this specialization is that people don't know any more everything about their own subject. If you have a broken leg, a neurologist won't be able to do anything to help you. But anyway, according to me, this evolution towards specialisation is useful and, moreover, ineluctable. It is first ineluctable because as I have said the knowledge is now so broad that a human being can't know everything. Furthermore, it is useful because it allows us to better understand a very specific point of our subjetc. For instance, all the progresses that have been made in the research for the cancer would not have been possible without this specialization.
       To have broad knowledge of many academic subjetcs is pleasant  but it also means that this knowledge will remain limited and it's why specialization is needed."
2561,0,"Some people think that young people enjoy life more than older people do. On one hand I agree with this idea but on yhe other hand I think it is not true.
   Of course young people have usually no responsabilities and serious problems to be sad. They play games and they live without thinking to their future. Young people are very innocent and they ignore all the tragical events of the life. This time is the best period for dreams, and young people think that they have all their life to do what they want.
When we become older, we loose this part of dream which caracterizes young people. Death and illusions have destroyed our part of innocence. 
But I can barely believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do. Happyness depends on lots of factors. Even if old people have already lived a big part of their life, I think this experience is the best way to appreciate the events. I mean that happyness depends on the value we give to an event. Old people usually know what is the most important in the life. There is a kind of wisedom which helps old people to be happy and to enjoy life.
Moreover many young people have a lot of problems. They are not protected against the events of the life like illness.
  So I think that those two periods offer different way to enjoy life. We don't enjoy the same things on the same age. Each life's period is like a season which gives a lot of fruits. I think the real difficulty is to pick up the fruits......"
10577,0,"First of all , I totally agree with the statement because in advertisement they make the product looks shiny  and in its perfect conditions and the results we see on it are not real because it was shown to us by actors not real consumers. Based on my experience, I tried many anti-dandruff shampoos that I've seen on television advertisements and they didn't work out. I followed the instructions on the bottle but I think it has something to do with the product its self. I tried another product I didn's see before on television and it worked out very well with me . I think what turns out to be good with you doesn't have to be  with everyone else.
	For example , In cars  we see these powerful cars that can go through any difficulties from climbing mountains to driving it in mud and on deep snow on the roads or off the roads while actually not all cars are capable of doing such things. they show us cars going very fast and you think that it is safe to drive in such speed while it's not.
	The most dangerous advertisements I see as aparent are the kid's advertisement specially when they show some chocolates and candies and the kid in the advertisement is eating as many as he can without brushing and his teeth are perfect while in real life that is not true. 
	But considering the people behind these advertisement , we find that they are companies trying to make money out of their product so they have to make their product look the best way possible to convince the viewers to go and buy it. Making advertisement is an industry now and the companies has the right make their product looks perfect but I think the viewers also have the right to know whether this advertisement is real and the product is like what they see before they buy it."
8227,0,"The life is change: my parents when they were child don't enjoy life as young people live today.
On the one hand thirty years ago the life was very different between  today because there weren't all attractive that there is today.
For example today the young people go to the disco every saturday night and become to home at the end part of the night; my parents usually tell me that when the week end came they went to the cinema in the afternoon and after they returned to home; often they went to restaurant after the cinema.
Moreover today young people have a cellular: partents can call everytime their children but I think that this elements could create a limit for the comunication between child and their friends or family.
On the other hand the world change day after day and it's wright that the people accept the news and the differents; I think that the parents must control their children for not exagerate in requests.
On balance I think that it's wright that young people enjoy life because a lot of years ago their parents enjoy life too."
10763,0,"I disagree with the statement that ""young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their communities.""
I believe that there are a lot of young people right now, that contribute to the benefits of our society and/or communities.

In the course of the last fifty years, young people have gained a lot of independence from their families and from their communities.
We have more freedom, of course within the bounds of our parents rules. But with independece comes responsiblity and I firmly believe that young people take this responsibilty not as a burden, but as a chance.

In Germany there are several volunteer based organisations, only led by some staff members, but made effective by their large volunteer basis. Church-, as well as Non-Profit- and Government-Organisations.

In these organisations most of the volunteers are young people. They can contribute the time and are willing to contribute the effort to improve something in their community. Because of my experience as a volunteer in the AFS (American Field Service, the world-leader in student exchange) and another Church-Organisation I take the freedom to discuss the motivation of young people to engage in these activities.

It is a plattform to communicate and connect with other young people, while improving your own ""soft-skills"" and helping a worthy project. That seems like a very good oportunity.
Young people know that they are helping, but in my opinion there is no reason not to have fun while doing it.

The discussed statement implies an older speaker, a grown-up, who believes that in his time, young people were doing more for their communities, that he in his youth was doing more, than young people do today.

Maybe the kind of work changed over the course of years as well.
Today these volunteer organisations make food ralleys, fundraise money doing car-washing or make benefit tombolas, while in the past, ""helping your community"" was maybe more like collecting trash from the community garden.

Helping your community has become more attractive over the course of time for young people and there are a lot of young people doing this kind of work, but maybe the areas of this work have changed so that for a outside viewer it looks like less is done."
290,0,"The speaker said that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. I totally agree this point. to support this point, we must investigate the main features of modern society, especially the effect of a television. 

The most imprtant invention of modern techology is the television. With the advent of TV, the advertisement has a greater effects on TV than newspapers and magazines. Today's people rely on TV in order to get more information around the world. We can just see the TV screen without any efforts. It is so easy! And the transmittance of information on TV is very fast to keep pace with the change of the world. Our techology could be possible to change the world very fast. 
Seeing the screen means that we could be easily effected by image. Most advertisement should show their most things within a very short time. So they must try to emphasize their goods for people seeing many ad. There is the reason that many advertisements like to use the specific images. People cannot remember the name of a product, some remember the very advertisement of the product. This effects bring to the results of reproducing the more products by many factories. 

Some people said like that; the human is the being who can think reasonally. Well, I have no intention to deny this definition. With this kind of men's character, we can improve our level of life. But sometimes we should keep this definition in mind. Human has also a very emotional character. We can find the good example such as several war in world history. People can be easily affected by the visual things. We can easily judge a person by the image that he(or she) showed in the first meeting. Many advertisement also have a"

Second one is the price of gasolin.

                                            No body would disagree with me if i say that the number of cars would comedown,instead i will say the reason why more number cars would still be in use,which is because there is tremendous amount of competition among the car manufacturers.Obviously to increase their sales they would come out with various offers as a festival gift.and also growing economy of the people allow them to buy a car which would automatically increase the no of cars.
                      To explain my answer i would quote an example of my city where no of car purchasers are getting increased and also as far as the latest data are concerned, each family in india would own car in the next twenty years and also i do not see any reason for the number of cars to comedown in the next twenty years and also as the car provides you much comfort,no people would love to loose that option.
                        So,that is why i would completely disagree with the statement mentioned above that ""in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today"".Instead i would tell you that the no.of cars in usage will be higher than there are now,considering fact that the companies sell the cars at a cheaper rate and also the increasing economy that would allow the people to buy a car and also the comfort that the car provides."

  In my own point of view, I am partially agree with the first statement. In fact, to succed  we do not need to be especially smart. And the success of what we do depend rather on the occurancy and the perseverance of our trials than on our willengness to take risk or on our curiosity.
  we have several examples of success stories of ordinary people that excelled in their traditional jobs and reach fame and wealth by offering their customers a usual products but with better quality. And that relying on their own experience and know-how it means that their success was due to the fact of doing well what they already know how to do.
  this point of view does not exclude the fact that a lot of people have knew success by taking risks or by tring new things, ways                  or methods: It is largely admitted that  the dare, the courage and the curiosity of pioneers and scientists permitted to the humanity to make great steps in the way of prosperity and developpement. Also discoveries and inventions will be impossible without a touch of imagination and risk.

There are some advertisements make prosucts that seem better and beautiful mucth than they are. But actiully they are not they are just try to trick you and to sells their products.

Why I desagree with it?, I desagree because of several reasons, and I hope you to agree with my opinion.
   First of all, maybe you have to buy some products to your own market or your home, and some of theis products maybe are expensive beacause they are looke better and good, but when you use them for one year you will start to face some problems with those products because they are really not good. 
   In addition on that, some customers or people will not trust this products anymore, because they always see the products better but they are really not. And thats make some people keep away from this products. and this will make some products be worest, and also this is the most important reason to let me disagree with it
   Finally, I will give an example on that, if I have my products and the people knew that my products just seem better but it is really not, they will left my products and they will buy another one.

11742,0,"It is a common opinion to think that young people enjoy life more than older people do because they have the strength and the health. Maybe this popular statement was true until fifty years ago but great shift occured and things have changed. So, why can we argue that older people enjoy life as much as -or more than- young people ? 
To answer to this horny issue, we will need in a first part to talk about the shift that occured in the way of life of the different generations and we will then discuss if young people enjoy life more than older people do.


In the fifties, we could say that young people had a better life than their ancestors. Indeed, the older people often retired when they were quite old -often 65 years old-. So they were very tired and did not enjoy the life. Actually people died younger and they were often not very rich. All the money was used to raise the numerous children of the family. So, the older people spent their times complaining and suffering diseases. But thngs have changed since the nineties. Thanks to the technological and medical breakthrough, people can expect to live until they are 80. Difficult and dangerous works have mainly disappeared so people can retire with a very good health and many years to live. Besides, thanks to the reduction of the sizes of the families, the older people have a lot of money to spend.

So, nowadays, the older people enjoy more life than young people in my opinion because they are strong and rich. So they can do whatever they want and they profit ! They travel a lot, cares for their sons' children - but with pleasure-, experience new technological activities, attend cultural events and even go back to school to accurate their knowledge. However, it has become more and more dificult to be young. Indeed, the lengths of degrees at the university have sharply increased and so did the price for the leases of an appartment. 

In a nutshell I would say that the older people can afford to enjoy life more than young people because they have still a good health and live better thanks to the improvements realized in the field of medecine. But money is not everything and the young people have a very strong advantage: they have still many good times to experience, they do not have to look backward."
4831,0,"Since the times of the renaissance, people ask the question if it is better to have a vast knowledge in as many fields as possible or to be one of the best in a single subject.

I believe that the rennaissance-man, a person who knows a lot about many subjects, like Leonardo da Vinci, still should be the ideal for all of us- even if this might sound a bit outdated.

There are three reasons that make me think that it is still wrong to specialize in one specific subject.

First, there is my personal situtation. As a lawyer, it would be a big mistake for me to concentrate on only one single subject. If i want to win a case in court in - for example, a case where technical questions are to be considered- it is not enough to just know about the law. You have to understand the technical issues as good as possible.

Second, since most people tend to specialize, the allrounder can have a big advantage. He is not part of the big crowd of specialists. He is different. And there will always be companies who want to hire somebody who is able to look at a certain problem from another angle- something the specialist simply can not provide.

Third, specialization can lead to boredom. The one that has to deal with only one specific subject for all of his professional life is likely to become frustrated for not being able to do something else for an instance. And because people change over the time, doing something is what many people desperately want.

Da Vinci was an artist, a doctor and an inventor to name just a few of the fields he was working in. He always was given a job as far as i know. He was able to merge his artistic talents and his knowledge of the human body- something a specialist, taught in only one of these fields, would be unable to do. And there are no reports that Da Vinci ever got fed up with what he was doing. 

Therefore i believe that he, who had vast knowledge of many academic subjects, still would be better up in modern society than all of the specialists."

So older people tend to enjoy their lives more than young people do because young people are always livng their present for the future, which can not be enjoying their lives, but only working hard enough to be happy when they are old.  But old people have only shor period of life span left and have less future than the young people which let them enjoy their lives rather than working hard for their shortly-left future.
	
	Comparing a student and a old professor in college, the student is not enjoying their life, unless he or she has no future.  The student is trying his best to learn as much as he can about his career that he wants to do in the future.

	However the old professor just watches him struggle sometimes and help them, then watches the student being happy after achieving what the student has wanted.  The professor has been what he had been wanted forever when he was young and now enjoys his life helping his student who is not enjoying his life yet, but eventually will.  They don't have to plan their lifes any more, all they need to do is just help the students or just have break reading the books they want to read and prepare for the lecture, which is fun for the professors because it's what they wanted to do for life.  It applies not only for the professor but also with all the other people who has a professional jobs.

	Old people tend to enjoy their lives more than younger people because they have done what they have planned when they were young and now they just need to relax and spend the rest of shortly-left future with what they have achieved.  Younger people could seem to be enjoy their lives in a lot of ways like partying, but that is not the real enjoying, because they are worrying about their future in the corner of their mind, while te older people are really enjoying their lives without worrying about their future even though the way they enjoy lives could not be as crazy as the young people do."
5130,0,"Times change quickly...very quickly indeed. A few years ago, the computers were reserved for the army, Internet was unknown. One may ask, 'what is the point of having a broad knowledge if it will soon become outdated and useless? Isn't it better to specialize in one subject and try to keep in touch with its evolution?' I will try to answer this question to the light of my own education and beliefs. 

I believe that acquiring a broad knowledge is very important for people. Subjects are all linked together and the understanding of one can lead to the discovery of another. Have you ever tried to learn how to play music without knowing about the notes? Learning about geopolitics without knowing about history is the same. There is no clear division between subjects. Some are necessary to learn about others.

Another reason is the importance of learning. What we learn is not that much important. The way we learn it, however, is important. We learn how to learn. And that is achieved through learning about a lot of subjects. This way, people will know how to learn all their life long, even when they will be out of school. Knowing a lot helps learning better. 

The main argument against this theory is that people, who know a lot about many facts, know indeed little. It is difficult to counterpart this argument. One who is interested in many subjects, will never reach the same level of awareness and mastering than the one who has only studied this very subject. 

However, I would like to point out that this person will have troubles putting what he has learned into perspective, while the one who has a broad knowledge of things will be able to connect facts. 

Learning a lot about many academics subjects may prepare people to understand the convergence of the world. Global has become a masterword today...one that noone can escape. One can only prepare himself for it...by learning as much as possible for instance."

First of all, when you are choosing a place to go on vacation and you have never been there before, the best way to know the place is traveling with a group of persons leadding by a tour guide.  He knows exactly where to take you, so that you can know the most interesting places about the city you are visiting, and may be if there is a second time you travel there you know exactly where to go.  This of course could not happend if you travel by yourself the first time, unless you have someone you know there.
Secondly, most of the tour travels let you a day free or an afternoon free for personal activities, and if you are traveling with a tour guide, is that, he can recommends you places or things to do in that free time depending on your interest, so that you can make even more things.  For example if you are traveling with your children you may be would like a place so that both, parents and children, can have fun together, in the case of a young couple may be they prefer going to a casino, and things like that.  The tour guide may have the correct plan for you.
And finally travelling with a group of people it is a very fun thing to do, because you can get to know a lot of them, it always happens that may be in the group there is the lady that nobody cannot stands because of her behavoir, or may be there is the weird couple with their freek kid.  At the end of the trip you can give your phone number or email to everybody so that when returning to your resident place you can keep contact with some of them and also you can tell your experience about how you made new friends during your last vacations."

        In every new generation there are new minds and new people that thinks about life in a different way. With all the discoviries that have been done and the new minds whicj are comin to the world they will surely discover a new way of transportation that will make cars dissappear.
        Nowadays air crafts and air transportaion is the largist kind of transportation in the world, and with all this spreading in this kind of transportation and the knoledge in it are making cars a way of transportation that will not last .
        therefor, i think that cars woud'nt last and there will be some other ways to move from some place to another in less time and less affort."

In fact, the young people do too noise, listen too high the music, speak too strong, drive too speed and they don't respect the older people.

Then, for the young people, they think that the people older  don't want understand them.
The younger believe that the older people have never already crazy like them.

This two groups think different but they are just human people. They don't just have the same age. That why they don't have the same reaction face to the life.

For the older people, this same thing create just a smile....because their life is behond them."

    In each trip the time is going to be an important factor. How you are going to manage you time with out the leader who has enough expeirnce on that area that you area going to visit.

10395,0,"I disagree to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. I have two reasons to support my opinion.
     First of all, I think there is a limit that people can learn. If they want to study many academic subjects, the knowledge of them become usefulless. I think people cannot concentrate them with such a lot of subjects at once! It has no meanings that people have usefulless knowledge.
     Secondly, all of the people must have the subject they are good at and not so. For example, I belong to the Fuculty of Arts and Letters. I think I am good at English and Japanese but not good at Math and Science. My friends in this Faculty also say that. On the other hand, my friends who are in the Faculties of Science, Engeneering, Agriculture say that they are good at Math and Science but not good at Japanese. It is obviously on hand! Studying the subjects that people are not good at is not effective. They feel more boring when they study such subjects than when they study ones they like.
     These are the reasons why I think it is better to specialize in one specific subject. To concentrate with one subject in particular you are interested in, it is done a lot of great studies each sections."
8642,0,"I totally agree with the given statement. 

Ideas and concepts are associated with the thinkers and innovators. Whereas learning facts is associated with the followers.

The understanding of an idea or concept gives students the ability to innovate, and to develop their ability to deal with different circumstances and problems. Merely memorizing facts will simply let the student know of a particular solution, but would not empower him/her to develop new solutions.

Let us take the example of classical physics. There are several equations and several forms of equations. However, these numerous equations are derived from certain core concepts of principles. Once these principles are understood, any equation can be derived. But the understanding of these concepts is extremely important to master trhe subject.

This does not only hold true in the case of science/ technology areas. Understanding the concepts is critical to all areas of studies. For example, a management student refers to several case studies. But the intention for this is not to merely note the actions taken by earlier managers to deal with problems and to keep a record of the same. The intention is to analyse and think of possible solutions and to understand how the particular decision was taken. This approach would give future managers capability to come up with innovative solutions.

Today, we have so many electronic gadgets to manage data. Do we wish to turn our brain into another data storage warehouse? Our brain can do something that not even the fastest computers can. That is to innovate, to think, and to get ideas. Let us not waste it by encouraging students to give importance to merely learning facts.

I am not averse to the idea of learning facts. It is important. Knowing the facts enable us to speak confidently about a particular topic. However, knowing the concepts behind those facts is what will lead you to innovate new facts!"

First of all, because of cars, we can travel to anywhere we want in a short time than brfore. A good case of thie opint is that: in the past , if we  wanted to visit somewhere, we have no choice but to get there on foot ,or by sea. But now it is convenient for us to drive there.So ,car really help ue a lot to let our travel-dream come true.
Secondly, cars can also cheap for us to buy. Society is enriching itself at a high speed. There is no denying that the quility of people' life is jumpinh to a higher level than before. A clear-cut example of thie point is that:in China , because of the price of cars is changing so fast. In the old days,  not every family had a car .In contrast, nowsdays ,every family has at least one car. I n sum, car are availible for people to get.
The last but not the least, cars are developing themselves by the scientists. For instance ,the old cars are not enviromental-friendly. In another word ,the old cars cause the air- pollution,water -pollution.and globle warming. However , the new cars are more envitomental-protective,and ueser-friendly.
As time goes by, the cars will  surely impact on more fields than before.Therefore ,in the next  twenty years, the cars can be used in many different ways by numerous persons."
4675,0,"It is a common belief that advertisments make product seem much better than they really are, and for this reason they help making them look more desiderable. In my opinion this belief is true, and this is why a lot of investments are made on advertising.
The first fact that makes products more desiderable is the way they are presented. If the description underlines the positive aspects of the products, and if it hides negative aspects of them, it is likely to happen that people would appreciate them. For example a beer may be advertised describing its flavour and its colour in a very positive way. Besides to make it desiderable it should be presented not mentioning problems of alchoolism and driving accidents.
The second think that help advertisment to make its products better is the association of them with positive aspects of life. For example, when you advertise a kind of beer you can present it as the one drunk by very important people, or you can take a photo of a beautifull naked woman with your beer in her hands. The positivity of the persons linked with the product is automaticaly transfered to the product itself by the receiver of the message.
Another aspect related to this subject is the absence of the product. When you are looking at an advertising image or a TV program it is probable that you have not that product nearby. When you see it, presented in a positive light, associated with a positive event, you want it. The absence increases desire. The desire of the product makes it better simply because it is not present. For example if you see a beer on the television in a hot day, presented as a very fresh drink, by a beautifull young woman, you desire it. The desire makes the beer much better than it really is."
10864,0,"Young people might someties be more able to enjoy life  than older people because young people have a very important thing in life that unfortunatly elder people do not have; health. 
Young people are normally more capable of doing activities or things to enjoy themselves more because they do not have to deal with as many problems as older people have to deal with. The stress that older  people have to deal with in their life might lead them not to enjoy life as much they want to. My father once told me something I am never going to forget. He said  that when you are young you have the health and the time to enjoy life but you did not have the money to do so. And that one had to work hard to earn money, which might cause us not to enjoy life as much. Then when you are older, between forty and fifty, you had normally made more money, you were still healthy but you no longer had time to do anything to enjoy life as we are supposed to. Later, when you are old, you  had all the money you are going to have and  you had all the time in the world, but you no longer had health to enjoy life and have fun. 
To my opinion, one has to be able to find the perfect balance between when you are young, older and old. One has  to be able to achieve happiness when you are young by doing things that do not involve to much money. Later, you have to make sure you are leaving enought time for things such as traveling and family  to be able to appreciate life. And when you are finally old and are normally no longer healthy, you have to be able to enjoy life with what you have left, such as family and friends."
2587,0,"In this essay, I will discuss, whether it is important to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects, or to favor Specialization.

To my mind, specializing in one subject is an old-fashioned way of thinking and is not favorable nowadays.
The main reason for that is the job situation of our modern society. In the generation of my parents it was common to study one topic, then get a job and being working in this job for their whole working life.
Today, things have changed.
Mostly because of economical means, the job situation is not that reliable as is once was. In the last decades, the frequency of hiring and firing employees has increased and is still increasing. The consequence of this development is that people often have to change jobs.
The only way of surviving in this new circumstances is to be as flexible as one can be. If you now choose one special field to study, there will be no guarantee for you to find a job in this sector, especially not for your whole working life.
Only if you are planning to do research after having finished your studies it might make sense to concentrate on a specific topic. To find new ideas and to really change the world you cannot  study every possible subject in detail, because it is neither efficient nor manageable. But this is definitly not the most common case.
And of course do companies like employees who are very well trained, but for you yourself it is important to remain flexible and to be able to learn new things, which will be necessary in the future working life.
Studying should be a preparation for your life and the only way  to accomodate your studies to the modern job situation is to do your studies with wide-spread interest."
4943,0,"I do agree that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today despite the rapid increase of car consumption. My reasons to believe so are stated below.

First of all, more and more people are willing to take mass transportation to go to work nowadays than a few years ago.Because  the traffic jam is more and more serious, people living in the cities prefer to take buses and subways to go to work to avoid such heavy traffic jams. With the scarce of resource this problem might not be solved in years. What's more,to ride in mass transportation saves people valuable time to do other productive things.Beside riding on mass transportation give city people more time to relax and think for their lives on their way home and to work. 

Secondly, governments all over the world are becoming more aware of the pollution cars bring. Some governments even set up rules to ban certain cars to run in the cities during paticular times. Such rules forbiding the use of certain cars will continue to effect in the long run. This will help to reduce the use of cars gradually.

Thirdly, people today are more concerned with their own health than ever. Some may even walk to work or ride a bike to work instead of driving a car. On weekend, more people go biking instead of go driving to rural resorts to relax. Taking the popular biking clubs for example, they are developing quite rapidly to support the idea a lot of people are holding today that  it's better to travel along with physical exercises. These kind of change helps me to belief that there will be fewer cars in the future.

In spite of all the above, the rapidly developed mass tranportation system and the widely accepted concept that health is most important in one's life both add up to my belief that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.

To sum up, with the widely spreading concept  of maintaining good health , the utility of advanced mass transportation and the help of the govenment, there will be fewer cars in 20 years use than there are today."
4305,0,"In order to be successful, do we need to try new things? Or, should we stick to what we know how to do best?  Don't we have an intirinsic cruiosity? So, what makes us frightened to try new things or should we be brave enough to chose not to do what we already know best? Could we imagine any progression if we did not try any new thing? As a successful commander  Sir Winston Chirchill has a saying: ""The first of all values of man is courage"". I agree that in order to be succesful people should be brave and try new things. 

Let us first look at to the history and pick up Mr. Edison. He invented the lamb after tryind 2000 different ways leading him to dissappointment. He tried ""2000 new things"" and came up with the lamb. Likewise, we can consider Darwin and his theory against creavitism.

Besides, being historically proved our intrinsic cruiosity always leads us to try new things. People always wonder about what we do not have or what we have never seen. We wonder what it feels to be Popstar, or we go on a vacation to see a part of the world. Since it is our nature why should we resist it. It is like to be a carnivoriuos loin! Can you imagine such a lion survive or become successful. 

In order to be successful people should try new things."
4762,0,"With the swift and tremendous development of industry, people are making every effort to enjoy life. In the mean time, the industrial growth also brings huge damages to human living conditions. The air pollution produced by over use of vehicles is a warn that people should cut down on the application of them, which leads me to believe that in 20 years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.

To begin with, the abuse of cars has caused severe environmental issues. Many people have been in possession of cars for quite a long time. They travel by car, go to work in a car, and even discuss commercial transactions in the moving status since it  is an efficient way to promote the dealings. However, it is commonly realized that gasoline consumption may lead to undoubtedly serious environmental problems including but not limited to air pollution and infectious diseases concerning lung functions. The gas emitted by the engine is a detriment to  human living surroudings, which can damage human lungs, limiting the function of breathing  to carry adequate oxygen to every part of huamn bodies. On the other hand, such emitted gas can drift in the air for a long time possibly becoming the excellent medium  for the growth of bacteria.

Furthermore, nowadays, more and more people are wary of the problems caused by cars. People, aiming at sustainable development, are undergoing  a lot of measures to control the damages. Scientists are conducting experiments to evaluate the results of car produced gas. Service workers are promulgating the latest or maybe recent findings of them to guide people in a correct direction--decrease the use of cars. 

People can also enhance their health by other alternatives of cars. They may practise their strength and endurabililty by riding or running in stead of driving. In this way, people force themselves to use their own muscles and energies which is a both  economic and effective way to improve their health and weight loss, a popular issue, may also be realized.

In a word, in my view, use of cars will become less and less in 20 years in that it results in rigid environmental damages, and people may become healthier by abandoning cars despite that cars without gasoline consumption may be produced out in a mass since the use of cars may increase human weight, causing a lot of problem relating to blood pressure and heart functions."
9076,0,"I completely agree with this statement.People become successful if they try different jobs and attain success in them.But trying different jobs involves risk.Hence to become successful tring different risky jobs is essential to any person.
                     Anyone have to try differet jobs to know in which they are talented as well as interested.If we go on doing the same things which we know,there is no further gain.We as well as lose the interest in what we are doing and finally get bored.Then we cant move further.We just dont know the destination.
	         If we go on trying new things we will certainly reach our destination one day or the other.Then we can develop ourselves in that task.Few of the scientists  have invented the best things which we are using today by experimenting in different fields or tasks.According to me without experimenting and taking risk one cannot achieve the best of what he can.Though not experimenting may not make the person a failure.
                     Enjoying life somewhat involves in attempting various tasks.Actually,the law of life is to face new tasks day-by-day.this law is just implemented to attain success.
                      We see in our day to day life, many people in different fields are trying new tasks.few examples are-
                                    actors trying in different concepts and themes to show their versatality,bussiness-man introducing new products and new advertising techniques,software engineers tring to work out and invent new soft wares etc...
                     Trying on different jobs may lead people to failure many-a times but this should not become a break to their experimental nature.They should recover from the failures and rise to success as said in the following proverb-""Failures are stepping stones for success"".this means that a person can learn a lot from failure about what to do and not to do.This experience makes the person more and more perfect as the time progresses.
	        So according to me everyone should try new tasks and accept challenges in life not only to attain success but also to enjoy the life in various aspects."
4750,0,"I strongly opine with the statement that it is best to travel in a group led by a tour guide. If you visit a new place, it is always better to consult a guide since we will be ignorant about the historical information.

There are lots of benefits when you have a travel guide around. The guides will have vast amount of information regarding the place. For example, they could give you historical significance of the place or any other important reasons for the fame of a particular place. It would be of no point in visiting places when you are completely unaware of its significance. 

And also, the guides will have vast knowledge about the places around so that we will not miss any of them and repent later. It is also convinient to interact with people when guides are around.There could be huge linguistic difference and also cultural difference. Also, there are all possibilities of getting cheated by people when you are a foreigner. Usuaully, the guides are multilingual and hence there are no chances of getting cheated.

In India, a south asian country, there are many historical places famous for its magnificient architecture. There are stories depicting their significane. It would be of no point if we look at the work without any knowledge about it. It would merely be a piece of work. But instead if we know the story behind its significance, we will be in a position to appreciate the work.

I could give a good example to support this point. One of my friends had been to a historical place in India. When she returned, she told me her experiences and the work she saw. She did not feel anything special about it. I then, explained the significance of the place. It was then she really appreciated it and felt that she should have known it then. She then appreciated the culture and did further research on the topic and the culture.

Hence, i feel that it is always better to have sufficient knowledge while visiting any place."
1840,0,"I personally believe the statement above to be false. It is important to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects but at the same time it is crucial to be specialized on something if one wants  to be successful. A well-rounded individual is not good enough when it comes to living through life. 
	   Schools teach pieces and bits of every subject to students. This is the part of their intelectual career in which they are introduced to all the different areas of knowledge; when their basic fundemantals are created. In this stage the student is able to explore all the different areas, and decide which of these is his/ her interest. This does not mean that the student has to pick one, but at least narrow down the list. Once school is over, students have their basic pillars of the academic subjects created.  
	College is the next step to  specialization. Students now decide where they want to specialize. If everybody had broad knowledge on everything and no specialities, society would not function correctly. A town needs a baker, a doctor, and a  blacksmith; these are not tasks that can be accomplished by everyone. For example, farming is a task that requires a lot of knowledge on the subject and dedication. If everybody had just some broad knowledge on the subject, crops would not grow very efficiently, so there might not be enough food to support the town. The town would not be able to survive if  there are no professionals in each area since all the jobs that have to be done would not be accomplished to their best. 
	It is fundamental to be introduced to all the areas of academic knowledge, to have a broad understanding on each subject area, but that is not enough for a society to function. In a society there has to be a certain degree of organization in order for it to run as expected: individuals should comprehend what their role in society is and fully accomplish it in order to run smoothly. If everybody is specialized on something he/she likes, then the task will most probably  be done as best as possible, and at the same  time, as a whole,  form a well-rounded society."
8038,0,"In general it is very hard to compare the level of enjoying life between younger and older people. They live in different situations with different problems and challenges.
Firstly one has to consider the situations in which the different groups are. Both have an unique profile. The big part of the young people has only few money, because they are going to school or studying at a university, so the possibilities and the offers are different from those who are older and have relatively more money.
Young people often enjoy their life by hanging around with friends, doing sports, in short activities that cost only few money, on the other side older people go to work and so they have relatively more money which they can spend by eating in good restaurants, visiting the opera or travelling.
By consideration these facts my opinion is that in general no one enjoy their live more. Because the different ressources which are necessary to enjoy your life are balanced.
To underline this, one can compare a student with a retired person, the retired person has a lot of time, he can decide what he does everytime, in spite of this he isn't in an better situation than a student that hasn't a lot of time for enjoying, the student have to prepare himself for his exams, but this time that he use for studying is no waste of time, probably the student is enjoying his matter, else he shouldn't have choosen it. On the other side the retired person can't fill allwazs all its freetime

In our consumistic society an object's value is no more calculated by considering how much useful is or how good does its task!
Now for most of the goods have to be ''cool'' and have ''good looking''. 
In order to increase the ''coolines'' of an object the producer spend a great amount of money in advertising and promotions!
In example Apple computer pay a fee to major of the cinema in order to make machintosh computer appear in movies! If you pay attention in films you can quite only see mac! An other exemple [excuse me for speeking always about computers but I'm studing computer science engeneering... so I'm a sort of computer geek] again froma Apple is the ''look'' of macs... the apple's coputer lines have always an extremely cured design!
An other way to convice people of the ''cooliness'' of a product is to associate the product to famous people that are known being fashion!
''Fashion''... this is a key word! In our world in order to sell something you must get it become fashion!
Think about the iPod... it is the most popular mp3 readr of the world... and not for its technology; it is famous due to the fact its design is ''cool''! So now having an iPod maks you a ''coolo'' person!
For the people of the 21st century being ''cool'' and fashion is the most important thing [in particular for young people.. in fact for the beeing par of a group, and in particular the cool one, it what they aim for].
Counting on the fact that most of people in the civilized world watch a minimum of 2 howr of television a day... the best way to let products be known is through tv! Not only by spots... but also trough ''subliminal'' messagges! This consumistic society want to keep us slave of: ''be cool  or be nothing''!"

If you have a broad knowledge in many areas you can make a lot of connections from a topic to another and you can speaks with a lot of people about a lot of subjects.You can have a general visions of the world and of the life but on the other hand you don't have specialization in one of this topic.
You only know the first floor of the things not others floor.
In some cases you should request an help from an expert in order to resolve a problem in the best way.
If you specialized in one specific subject you can know all about this in other words you are an ""expert"" in your field. I think that in this specialization there are two drawbacks: the first should be that you can not see the relathionship between this object and the rest of the world  and the second that you know anything about the other academic subjects.
I think that it is very difficult say what it is right and what It is wrong, every people should understand what is better for him and for his specific case.
I think that it depends also from the job of anyone.
I make an example in order to clarify my statement: a scientist that works in a laboratory must have a specific preparation on his work and on the other hand a politic or a general manager should have a general vision of the world or the company.
So I know that in my essay I don't answer to the question if I agree or not with the statement but for me It is very hard make a conclusion and say what it is the best one."
9813,0,"I agree that it is important for student to understand ideas and concepts for several reasons. First, it is good to understand the ideas and concepts. Because if they understand ideas and concepts, they can study more easy, and they are might interested in the ideas and concepts. For example, when I studied at school, my teacher did not teach ideas and concepts. Therefore, I was always comfused about it, and I did not understand what they want to say or what they want to teach us. Therefore, I think they should teach ideas and concepts. Second, if they understand it, they can say their opinion about these. I think that it is connect with develope about ideas and concepts. If they can say opinion and the opinion is good or useful, it is good to develope these. And it is goodfor students to practice saying opinion. Third, if they understand ideas and concepts, it is might useful in their future. If they do not understand ideas and concepts, they are not interested in these, and they think they do not want to use in future. I think if they know ideas and concepts, they are going to want to learn more or they want to know fact. If teacher want student learn more, I think it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts."

So, many people travel led by a our gudide because of ease to travel and book the hotel and transportation. However, I disagree with traveling by a tour guide. Before, criticizing travel by tour guide, This essay will discuss about pros and cons of travel by tour guide.

 Travel by tour guide have some benefit to begineers to travel. Begineers has no information about where, when, and how to hang aboung specified cities. When I was traveling around Shanghai PROC, I had to travel to use a tour guide. I had no information to use mass-transportation. However, I could't find the exictement of travel. Because, traveling cites was just famous sight. 

 The reason why I don't support using a tour guide in two ways. First, using a tour guide is not good way to see what the people do and live. When I was traveling around Beijing, I don't decide to use a tour guide rather than travel myself. It was hard time to travel. However everytime to try to travel, I could find some people to help me. I could see the markets where the people's breath. Second, traveling alone can provide free time to think, comparing to travel with a tour guide. With tour guide, I only follow the schdule what he provided. So, It isn't possible to find out the thought time.  However, traveling alone is possible to think the emotion where I traveled.

 There are pros and cons to travel by alone or group. In a group led by a tour guide would provied some excitement. However, It is better to travel alone who tastes the real excitement."
3066,0,"The education process has evolved during recent decades.  In the past decades, students were tought in a way that would only permitted them to memorize facts. The importance of education relied on accepting facts rather than understanding them. Things have changed, and nowadays students should understand ideas and concepts rather than learning only facts. The world demands well prepared people capable of analyzing situations, solving problems and proposing ideas.

	When students understand ideas and concepts rather than learning facts they are able to develop a process of constant and connected learning. They are able to apply ideas and concepts at different fields and they can find relations within different subjects. They have a broader spectrum of ideas that they can develop into competences throughout their student life. This makes the knowledge process smooth at all levels of education. Students are encouraged to understan rather than simply accepting ideas.

	The problem with learning only facts is that it partializes the knowledge. A student would only memorize facts for a certain subject and it would not be able to find its aplicability in other fields. Facts only respond to specific details and eventough they are useful, they can not constitute the pure basis for education. Facts don't permit discussion.

	As an example of what I have presented before we can analyze a history class. It is different to learn history learning only dates and facts that took place at a certain time, than to undestand ideas and concepts that lay behind the facts. If a student is able to see the connection between events and to undestand the conditions that gave birth to a certain fact they would undestand many of the things that take place today.

	As a conclusion I would say that the education process needs facts as well as undestanding ideas and concepts but the last one, is more important for developing a well constructed and supported knowledge.

     As far as i am concerned i think that most students know ideas and concepts. Indeed they are more taught in the universities. I think they are the first point in a teachers lecture. With this point students can understand facts.

     However I think we shuold bear in mind facts. They are important too. For instance if all presidents or rulers knew the history of the world they could avoid doing the same mistake. Wars are proof of this.
Moreover facts are also important on economic grounds. For instance in order to make forecasts. Indeed facts are always the same if we consider a long period. But after a fact we have to analyse it with concepts.

On the other hand I think that students prefer learn facts. It is more interessant because it is co

53,0,"Each day, numerous new products are welcomed by the market and the need to promote a specific item among these huge inflation of consumption attractions stimulated advertisement sector to be one of the most fast growing sector of the econopmic system. Keeping in mind that the main role of advertisements is to make products look much better in order to sell more,  I agree very much with the idea that advertisement might sometimes lie for some eligible reasons.
   
        First of all, one should remember which context we are talking about. It is highly developed capitalist society, where consumption has become in such an intrinsic way that the competitiveness within the market is incredible, nevertheless the products have more or less same quality. Therefore, it is indispensible for advertisement to make products seem more valuable than they really are in order to look like making a difference. Obviously, we all imagine that this new kind of toothpaste that we watched on TV would not be so different from the previous type that we use every day. Or prepaid soup does never look as delicious as appears on TV nor does it taste any better from my mother's natural recipe. 

          Although I understand the reasons why advertisements might be mistaken, I contend that some of the advertisements go as far as violating customer's rights. For instance, most of the time the long advertisements on fitness equipments present the product as the  
most efficient one ever existed on earth and the ads also relies on the former customers' testimonials in order to assure new ones. I regret to say that most of time, these people recommending the products happen to be amateur actors, not happy customers. This is an example where innocent people's time, money and energy is exploited. I remember my mother once buying such a product and realized how worthless it was.
  
         To conclude, I would like to call people to be more careful about advertisements and never forget what they are seking for. I guess this difficult situation is the inevitable kind of life provided by cunsumer society."
5433,0,"Personally, I do prefer to travel by myself. Traveling with a group has limitances that I think reduce your experiences in a place you have never been at.
Everytime a person is leaded by a guide, his preferences or opinions are more likely to be affected by other's opinions and, also are predeterminated by a person that already has a point of view based on his own experiences. 
When a person travels by his own, the only way to enjoy the travel is to be always aware of the world around, due to it is a new place and your senses are open to any movement. It is exciting because if you don't take care of the things around, bad experiences will happen easily. From this perspective, there is not doubt that traveling in group is much better. 
A group gives you a safety sensation, even if you don't know the people around, a feeling that whatever happens you will have somebody to share with, negative or positive. Also, a lot of friends can be made in a group trip, I believe it is another advantage. It is usually a long time spending together with new people that at the end, you share your new experiences with them. 
In other hand, traveling alone is a great idea to make new friends. Although it is true that it's only you in the trip, it doesn't mean that it is only you at the places you are visiting at! Also, at the end, you will share your experiences with other people and the most important, other's will share experiences quiet different from yours. As far as you are willing to meet new people and know different places, a predeterminated group is not necessary to enjoy a trip. 
In regards of the tour guide, from my standpoint, learn and search information by myself is the most reachness way to expand your knowledge about a new place. A tour guide will only tell you typical things, memorized information from a book or a little guide. Then, if I just want to know general things, I don't need a guide, I need a book.
Traveling by your own, you need to get information, maps, places and people. However the difficult but also the most rewarding part is not to have the data, is how to get this data. Due to there is nobody that will provide you all the instructions for the next day, schedules and rules, it's necessary to create yours. Creativity is the most important ingredient in a succesful trip, you need to define what to see, when to be there and how to enjoy it. 
Besides, traveling in group is much more expensive than traveling by your own, and in fact, it has sense. If you want somebody to be your tour guide and a complete schedule of your next days activities, you have to pay for it. 
In conclusion, a traveling experience is much more appreciated when it is created by the person, it is a way of live a trip even before you leave home."

       I have a good piano student. May be you can not image her age is almost 65. The first time she came to  meet me and told me she hope i can teach her piano. At start i can not believe. Because this skill is fit the young people, and not easy to get it . But she really like it. So i think i just to teach you, and latter you will give up youself. But until now she had studied about 2 years. And still enjoy it. At the end i know why she can instite on. Because this insteresed is from herself no boby foce her. But why many young people can not go on. Because they do not enjoy it. 
       Now have many tourist organise the old  peole to travell. Many old people would llike to join it. When they go to some famous history place they can really understand the backgroung and they can experience it. They wil more enjoy it. But for young people some time go to there just for play and dn not have any meaning. So i think it is to weast time and money.
     But i know as a young people in fact have many good points. For example we have good health, good motion and so on. Many old people so admire us. But i think young people and old people all have advantage and disadvantage. So some games we can play together. We can help each other.
      So in this world every one can enjoy the life."
9037,0,"Its true that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.It is the marketing skills of the companies in making profits.

Most of the advertisements are so well designed and presented that they attract large part of audience.People tend to buy those products.When it comes to reality the product does'nt seem better.For example,  women tend to buy various kinds of cosmetics with out actually knowing how well they suit them.


So customer should be very discerning in purchasing products.Its better not to be simply carried away by advertisements rather check the statistics of the product before purchasing. Consulting and taking others'(who might have already used the product) opinion  would help to purchase better products."
288,0,"the statement is that ""it is  more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts"".

i agree with this above statement that  is ""more important the ideas and the concepts to a student"".

because if we have some imagination then we will imagine and we will try to reach that imagine.

if we doesn't have any imagination then there is no way to reach some purticular state.

so the imagination is the important thing for the students because using with the alredy developed things they will try to do new things.
like that they can know each and every point where they face the problems and some achievements in there experiment.

so the concepts also take main role in the students life . if they have good knowledge in the concepts then only he will learn something new  otherwise he will not get good knowledge.

if the students wants gain more knowledge then its better to learn  understand the ideas of that field and understand  the concepts of that perticulal field.

if the students have good basics then they can easily analyse the new things very easily.and the student can capable to invent new things .

if every student start with some basics and concepts then it is easy to learn and with this students experiences they try to dis cover some more new things in the future.

the the next generation also try to learn the basics and the ideas from the elders or teachers. and they will implement furtherly.  


if the students learn facts then they will not sharpen their minds as well as they dont try to analyse that why that fact is made.

so this is the main disadvatage to a student to learn something new."
11144,0,"While it might seem like, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject, I, for myself, would choose the latter.

On first glance, having ideas about lots of areas seems like a good thing. You can talk about everything and you can reflect your opinions about everything. However, you don't really knowing any of the areas you talk about. The knowledge on all these areas would be limited and don't  reflect what that acedemic subject is all about. As an industrial engineer I can give that as an example. When we graduate from college, we all have the basic ideas about supply chain, inventory management, production planning, quality management, scheduling etc. However, during our graduate work, we end up choosing one of the sub-topics that industrial engineers work on. While a student working on scheduling may still know all other sub-divisions, he has the most knowledge about his own topic thus he can talk the most certainly about his own topic as well.

Considering that we expect people to take certain responsibilities in daily social life, and expect that to carry out these activties to masterhood, I would think the same is true for academic life as well. Since don't expect a butcher to do gardening, and a dentist to be an engineer, we shouldn't expect, say an industrial engineer, to be competant in both supply chain area and in quality management. A dentist is good at what he is doing beacuse he spent his time on mastering that, while an engineer spent his time on engineering subjects and so is good at that. Following with the same line of reasoning, an industrial engineer working on supply chain spents his time reading articles about that particular topic, writes his thesis on that particular topic and neglects the other parts of the discipline. 

Time constaraints and social constraints limit one's opportunity to know everything about anything. People knowing a broad range of academic subjects tend to look and know the superficial stuff about them, while others focusing on a certain topic, by limiting their concentration, know that particular subject in depth and so are more valuable to the development of the particular subject."
5747,0,"Nowadays, cars virtually become part of our daily lives. It is hard to imagine what the life will be without a car. We drive cars to shool, to office, to shoping malls, and, on weekends, to national parks. But if you ask me what will be the case twenty years later, I would hazard a guess that there will be fewer cars ! 

To begin with, energy shortage looms larger nowadays. Recent years wittness the skyroketing the crude oil prices is an example to illustrate the demand for oil far excesses the supply of it. The excess demand drives the price of the fuels drastically, so people will find it expensive to drive a car. Probably using public transportations is a more economical choice to travel to school, to office and so on.  In that case there will be fewer cars in use.

Another reason that may attribute to the shrinking of car usage is that cars, through burning fossil fuels, will pollute the environment. The exhaust of cars contains large amount of toxic gases such as sulfur and nitrigen oxicide, etc. When the pollution becomes more and more severe, the government will take measure to control the expansion of cars. The most possible measures are to levy higher taxes on using cars and to grant less driving licence to drivers. Under such conditions, people will have less incentive to buy cars and use cars.

In addition, the room for accomodating more cars is very limited. Today we already feel very crowded on roads and parking lots. If cars continue to expand, we will have more and more severe traffic jams, which will render car transportation slow. If people find that they are always late in class or office, they will resort to alternative means of transportation such as bicycles and subways.
 
Taking into consideration all these factors mentioned, private car drivers as well as potential car buyers may think twice before using cars. Twenty years later, cars may turn out to be an expensive and inconvenient way of going out."
5727,0,"The question ask me if I agree or disagree with the idea that if young people,nowadays have not much time for helping their comunities.
In my opinion I think that young people is able to do that but lats generations of young people are less carefull with their environment,their families etc.......I think that IF YOU PROPOSE IT YOU CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN.
It is true that young people is actually more bussy than because they have to study a lot at the high school or at the university.But they do that probably six hours a day or eight.So they have a lot of free hours to hepl their comunities.The main problem now is the boom of the Internet and the poor shows put on the television that only make the  young people keep in front of it.The children are many hours a day chating or playing with the playstation or watching horribles shows with level of education zero.New generations have change a lot.Another big big problem now are drugs.Very young people stars in the world of grugs since they are very little maybe because of social problems or problems in their families.They can not adapt well to the society,they have bad companions and then they left a healthy life.They waste much time in all these activities and maybe it is the problem for what they are not able to help their comunities to have a better aspect,to have a good growing..And  is due to that for what many comunities become bad for the society eye.
I think that another problem for what they can not help their comunities is not the ammount of time they have, but their education since they were born and the lack of sense and sensiblility they have,not only for helping their comunities but also for helping other people.
I am sure that television and internet are the first causes for this.Young people are lately very egoist and they only look for their own benefits.
Long before children were very different because TV and Internet did no exit and they have more time for sharing their lifes with their families,for playing more time and for helping their comunities.People then were more united.
Now young people only think on next; to study very little for having more free time and go by the city to parties,etc.
Finally,I think it has to be more information about education for young people and bring them more oportunities with more activities."
4842,0,"I agree with the statement because to me undeerstanding is the most important factor in learing for univerisity. The first reason is that if you understand an idea it is easier to remember it and the idea stays in mind longer than than a learned fact. Secondly I find it important to be able to apply the learned knowledge to other situations and study areas. One should be able to adopt  the learned features and work with them.

Understanding is very important for ideas you have to remember not only for a specific examination but for a long time. They stay in mind because you can imagine how the idea works. Although you can be sucessful in an exam just by learing the facts you will not be able to remember them later.
The most important reason why I prefer understanding is that facts which are understood can be adopted to your work. For example an engineer who knows how to build an engine but does not understand how it works will never be able to invent new feature to the engine, but someone who undestands the priciples of an engine will be able to improve it. This can be easily transferred to any other subject. So a psycholigist has to understand the theories of disorders, e.g. a depression, in order to help his patient. If he does not understand it he can only tell the patient more details on his disorder but cannot transfer the information to the individual. So this doctor is no real use to the patient because the patient can easily find these information in books.
If you understand a certain technique it is easy even to transfer it to completely different study field. It can help you to learn and understand even topics which are not related.

The given reasons are only a few reason why understandind is the more effective learning method. Besides there are many other advantages of understanding ideas. So for example learning can be a lot more interesting when you understand the ideas. It can be motivating and learning can be more fun."
10434,0,"In Korea, students who are before entering a university should memorize most of evrrything to prepare the test of  university. Why should hey do memorize everything? I think understanding those  and experiance are more important than just learnig. There are some reasons.

 First of all, If students just memorize idea and comcepts fot theit goals such as entering a university, getting a job, and graduation, will  they remember it long time? I think the answer is ""NO"". Because thier ultimate goals are not learnig and understanding for themselves. Thus, they just have studied to enter a university and  if  they enter a university, they will forget it eaily because they got thier goal yet.

 Second, if student don`t understand ideas and concepts, those will be furtile. It is because although they study those, they didn`t try to understand ideas. If they didn`t understand, will they use the knowleadge? and then can we call that is ""Knowleadge""? The learnig that is not be understanded is just waste.I think rather that not to know those better than it.

 Finally, in Korea, there are a few exentric school now. Those are same other school to learn. However, the style of study is different.
It is that their lessons are focused by understanding study. So, sometimes they go out to learn in class time. They experiance and understand everything so accumulate those. As  a result, the students of the school enter a university easier than ordinary school.
This tell us that understand is more impr 
 
 In conclusion, if students try to understand ideas and concepts, actually they should spend time long. However, the effort of them will appear clrealy and develop themselves more."
6327,0,"It is normally for people to grow,and while growing, we'll have a little bit of everything, happiness, enjoyment, sadness and depression. Ofcourse, every single stage has its own nice moments. But this concept changes from time to time. 
   For me, I think that young people enjoy alot more than what older people might do. For many reasons, the hardness of life will auscalate while being old because there will be many factors interfer with aging process. One thing is that, the duties for young people will be much lesser than those of older ones. All what young people has to do is going to the universtity, which is considered a source of pleasure, and all what he has to do is passing it. Here, he can do alot of things to make him happy. He can meet different people every single day, he can have his own group to spend nice times with, he can go to different places while being with that group, and he can enjoy being in an intimate relation by having a girlfriend with whome he can spend great times with less commitment.
   While, on the other hand, if we think about the older man who is supporrting that young man, we'll find alot of things to consider. He has to save money for his son's university, he has to manage the situation of the whole home inwhich there will be other brothers and sisters, and he has to keep managing for the wholy marriage life he is having. Also, in older people, they will start thinking about some issues arised later in life like retirment and loosing significant others.
   Finally, every single stage of life can have it is own sources of happiness and sadness. But being young will mean less duties with much fun."

791,0,"It has been well-established that successful people want to push their limits to the maximum and feel more and more sensations. I will develop and explain why I believed in this statement by using two main reasons illustrated by examples. The first reason is the money and the second one is the popularity.

	It is widespread that success goes with money. Successful people evidently are one of the part of the society where there is the less problems with money. Indeed, some of them (without thinking 'most of them') become disgusted to have what they want, to do everything they want, to own, to buy, to offer, to live what they want to. That is the first reason why this people try new things and take risks. They own lots of things so they want always more and the only way for them to feel alive is to push their limits. It is to be out of bound, to show to everybody that they can easily do what they want, more than buy what they want.
	By knowing and understanding this way of thinking , it permits me to go on the second reason why they are acting as extremely as a professional skateboarder, surfer, snowboarder or others extreme sports. It is due to their popularity. Besides being able to buy anything they want, they are proud of their ego and of the fact that unknown people loves them. Even though they are successful, they are also conscious on the effects they have on others who do not succeed. And they use it to prove to everyone that they can be more than someone who succeed. So they try new things and take unconscious risks to confirm that anyway they are a part of people they definetely succeed.

	I would like to conclude that I understand them. I do not mean I feel successful but except money and popularity I love feeling me alive by looking for new sensations, taking risks (always under laws and rules, of course) and prove to myself that I can do 'extra-things' like no one else."
4920,0,"The traffic,the huge amount of cars in the ways or streets and the problem of road travel is being discussed for many years.It is wanted to be solved and to solve this many solutions are developed.I don`t think this problem will be solved in twnety years and i don`t think there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.There are two reasons why i think like this.
          First reason i think the manufacturing never stops.I mean the manufacturing of the vehicles such as cars buses which carry people one place to another and occupy the roads.The firms produce many many vehicles every year and there is an absence of the rules about the older cars.Furthermore, older cars can be the main problem about traffic.The newer ones fill the roads every year,every months and even every day.In contrast,the solution is being thought that underways,undersea travel,metros,railways and sea travel may be considered to reduce the traffic jam and so do the number of cars in use.But i don`t think it is enough.
        Secondly,people usually choose their own vehicles to travel beacuse of many reasons,For example they may want more comfortable travel by their own vehicles and moreover it may be cheaper than the others.Besides, the trains,for instance, carry many many passanger in a day,however these many people can disturb each other when they are in the train. Therefore,there may be little decrease in the number of the cars.
       To sum up, there are two reaons i mentioned above that it can`t be possible that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years with todays technology.Besides,the firms have to produce more and more cars to exist and the people will always like comfort and their own cars.On the contrary;may be flying cars can change my mind if it is possible to manufactured."
11842,0,"I agree with the statement that successful people rather try new things and like to take risks than doing what they can already do. 
When you already know that you can do something, it's just normal that you try a new thing. 
Everybody wants to try new things. Small children are the best examples. When they are able to sit, they want to be able to walk. They get up and try to do so until they are able to do so. You're coming further when you try new things, you get new experiences as well. 
There's another example. If I'm able to read a german book easily, it's just normal that I start to read englisch books. I started reading englisch books when I was in grade 5. I already could read german books and was successful in reading german, so I tried so get some new experience and wanted to try a new thing. 
Taking risks is the same. People who are successful are often also secure. You only take risks when you feel stable at a certain level. Successful people always stand on a certain level, so they are more willing to take risks. 
There's also an example. If someone just built a house and now has many dues at the bank, he won't lend his neighbour much money. He's unsecure about his financial situation and therefore now is more cautionous. 
All in all, you can say that successful people always take risks and want to try new things. They feel secure in their life because they are satisfied with their situation at the moment. They therefore can risk something. It's easier to risk something when you are secure. You can't lose as much as someone whose situation is insecure at the moment. 
Another point is that sometimes you can be bored if you always do the same things. To get out of boredom, you start to do new things and also take risks. 
To summarize, I agree with the statement."
9684,0,"Though discussed for long, the question that wether to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject is better doesn't have a peaceful end.
For my opinion, I prefer to have a knowledge structure with more broadth rather the more specific. There are three advantages of a broad knowledge make me feel like it :
Firstly, broad knowledge means tends to support more comunication between peoples which means more understand. You'll get more characters in common with others when you share some knowledge with others, so you'll probably get to know what the likes and dislikes for other people, for example, my father can understand me quite well for he know all that what i have known;
Secondly, this will make you more successful in social activities. As you understand others more and give them what they want, get rid of what they don't want, you'll build a good relationship with any others and gain their help when you need. As for example, many political leaders and business champions are this kind, such as Bush and Bill Gates.
Last but maybe the most important point, you'll find the knowledge of each specfic domain are connected to each other. In fact, under some situation, the connection is even more important in each of the individual ones. Take Computer Lingustics for example, before 1980, Lingustics is not considered to be a popular research area, but after the induction of computer, more and more organizations and people devote themselves in it, even govment cast an interest on it, and it is a hot research domain now, both for domain of Lingustics and domain of Computer Science.
Since all of above, I prefer to have a knowledge structure with more broadth rather the more specific."
5212,0,"The first questions that comes to my mind after reading that statement is ""Did people in the past spend more time helping their communities?"". To answer that question we should take a short look at the society in earlier times. A hundred years ago the communties where much smaller than these days. 300 years ago there was no supermarket in small villages. People had to work together to survive. The farmer had to grow food, the tailor had to produce clothes. Everyone was interested in getting the best out of what they were doing. Therefore they often contributed something to help their community. That has changed. Today a lot of people don't really care about their neighbors and/or surroundings. For example we have a big house with 6 floors. 20 Families are living in this house. The house is very dirty inside, when you step outside you can find dog's excrements everywhere. Neighbors call the police all the time, because they think their neighbor is too noisy. Here we can see that even in a small community like the house in my example is not working together. They are not helping eachother and instead try to make life harder for everyone around. The country Germany is another example for a community. We have many different provinces in this country and they usually don't work together that much. Every province tries to get the best result for themselves, but instead of doing that through helping other provinces and contributing something to the community they just try to get the most amount of money they can. So why is it that people nowadays do not spend a lot of time to help their communities? We all know that people have the time. People watch many hours T.V. everyday due to boredom. They could use that time to help the community. The problem is that a lot of people don't feel responsible for their community anymore. They see that the house is dirty, but they are not willing to do anything about it. Either because they think ""I'm not going to do it, someone else can do it."" or they think ""If nobody is cleaning it, why should I?"". A way to solve this issue could be to encourage people to contribute something for their community and make life better for everyone."
5261,0,"Having less cars in twenty years time does not seem to be possible due to several reasons: comfort of the cars, availability of a technolgy and global reasons.
	As the children of the twentied century we were born with cars, live and grow with them. We have so much famaliar and used to them. We can not find comfort of these cars in any of vehicles, bicycle or motorcycle or a ship or train non of those can provide the comfort and service we used to hava with our cars.
	Secondly, the technology is not available to make an vehicle that can compute with car. Space ships, planes or helicopters they may have seem to compute with cars but it should also be taken into account that they cost too much that ordinary people can afford. Or even they can afford them some time where they will park their helicopter or where they will land with their plane. It is a big question mark and does not seems to be realistic.
	The last but the most important one is the global reasons. The big car producing companies will not let a change in current status of the cars by making big cuts from prices. Not only the car producers but also oil companies do not want fewer cars in use as their profits will decrease with less gasoline sales. The same reason can be taken for oil -exporter countries and or for the countries who makes too much money from petroleum sector such as USA, Russia, and Middle East countries that determines and effects the political and economical decisions all over the world.
	In conclusion, in twenty years, there will not be fewer cars in use than today as we get used to the comfort of our cars which we can buy by less money than other vehicles provided  with the current technolgy. And the global powers will not let a change in the situtation in unfavourably of them as a  result of change in oil sector."
8460,0,"Travelling has been one of the most favorit activities for all the people nowadays since it will bring us lots of benifits such as relaxation and entertainment. In my point of view, the best way of travelling is in a group led by a tour guide. 

It is obviously that the visitors are unfamiliar with the torism spots and most of them may go there for the first time. It is dangerous that a peron wonders around the place he/she gets little knowlege and information about it. People may lose their way during the trip and waste a large amount of time. Such situation will influence visitors' mood and subtract joys during the vacation. If they all led by a tour guide will avoid such depress experience.

In addition, a tour guide must get to konw the tourism spots both for the direction and the culture. The most vital and attractive element during a travel is to enjoy both the appearance of the place and its backgroud stories as well as its culture. If you travel alone will miss such indispensible information and can't enjoy the process completely. Therefore to travel with a tour guide is a must choice.

Last but not least, you will meet at least several person who are all unfamiliar with each other during the trip. The tour guide can perform as a leader in this small orgmization temperally and it will lead to important effort. I have such experience before in person. During the first day trip, I didn't konw anyone around me and even felt regret to take part in this travel. However, my tour guide found my negotive emotion soon. She accompaied with me and introduced me to other visitors. After she gathered some people and choice interesting topic for us, I felt more comfortable and joys for the travelling than before. During test days, I really enjoyed the travel and met lots of new friends and I will cetainly thank for the tour guide for her work.

4236,0,"Firstly, I thing that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects may be,culturally speaking, really interesting but that it can also lead to a confused professional guide line in the future. Therefore, the first objective that each student should have will be, to my point of view, to find out what they will be in ten years in order to have a clear objective during all their studies. Even tough, it is ,obviously, really hard to now at 18 years old what you will be in the future, I profundly believe that the question should be raised carefully in order to create the student motivation.

	Moreover, I do believe that at one stage or another we have to find out what we really want to do and then, in order to achieve, this objective to specialize ourselves. To take a simple example, at the end of my bachelor degree in foreign language I did realize that  this section was not diversify enough, so I decided to change for another direction: international commerce. My point, is that it is important to focus on a specific guide line but without being too specific.

Nevertheless, being stuck in a specific subject can be prove to be a handicaped for the search of a job latter on. In fact, for some subjects a specification can put the student in a very difficult position, for example we all know that nowadays some departments or branches or no longer relevant or cannot be provided any more. Students that are specialized in these subjects will therefore have problems to find a job at the en d of their studies and they will probably have to pass another university diploma to get a more general degree in order to find a job."
4479,0,"Yes. For example this it's possible to observ this question  in a TV spots. We all days watch TV and so a lot of spots. The object or the produtc of spot  is showed always like a magic thing. This is valued from a home product to a healt product. Sometimes we see, in a spot,  beauty creams that make miracles; a woman change from a fat to slim with a few of creams. Another example is about the clotings; the message of spot is if you use that kind of jacket you'll be cool! Finally if you are in a supermarket you can see differnts types of the same product, but it's always the same. This a problem beacause a young mind can fall in this point of view and so think in this way. We live in a rich society but at meantime there is a poor class of people."
5673,0,"I support the notion that young people enjoy life more than older people do. I would like to support this with the following observations from my personal experiences.
With the advent of technology, a greater number of means are available for young people to enjoy life. When I was kid the aveneues for enjoying were limited in India. Now kids at young age have different options such as video games which I never had an access to. This translates to the older people too, who would have no access to these gadgets. Even if they have access they have to develop the aptitude and zeal to learn how to operate these devices.

In the era of consumerism more and more products are offered for the young generation because they control the spending.Companies that tailor their offerings to the old people are between far and few. I feel this also has to do with the age. As people grow they become more mature,their interests change and they also tend be more appreciative of the needs of the family members. As a result they curb their activities and go into their own shell.

Last but not the least ,with the onset of the old age people start suffering with various ailments that take off their most time. They have to restrict or avoid outdoor fun activities which they would have done in their younger years. 
Having said that young people enjoy life more , I would not like to state that old people do not enjoy life at all. But as discussed above the means change as the time passes and they start limiting their activities."
7472,0,"In my opinion there is no single correct answer to this question. Of course both ways can lead to success. My main reasoning is that it depends on the path one wants to follow whether an academic specialization makes sense or not. My aim is to explain this argument in the following sentences by looking at the broad academic field of business.

In Switzerland, a masters student can choose whether he wants to specialize in one specific subject - as finance - or to keep his focus on a broad approach which includes subjects such as marketing, human resources, finance, strategic management, risk management, leadership.

To illustrate my hypothesis mentioned above I will now have a look at two different jobs within a company.

A general manager and his management team need not to be specialized in one specific subject as they have to address problems of many different fields - such as leadership issues, marketing decisions and financial topics. An important aspect in the job of a manager is the need to quickly decide on many different issues. Thus a broad education is actually an advantage.

An employee in the financial sector such as in a bank does not need to have such a broad knowledge. Rather it is essential that he possesses in-depth knowledge of the transactions within the sector and on the sector itself. The job requirement is much more focused. Rather than just knowing little about everything it is advisable to have a solid knowledge of this special topic - and finance for example is actually still a rather broad subject.

But of course it is needless to say that knowledge is allways an added asset. However one has to decide first which path will be chosen in order to be able to make a sound decision whether an academic specialization makes sense."
9709,0,"Success is the fruitful result that a person gets after a job has been accomplished correctly and in the manner it has to be done.
Failures are a stepping stones to success and one must try and try until he succeeds in doing his things in the right manner that is needed.
For instance an ant who wanted to climb a wall tried several times but failed.though not fairing in climbing the wall the ant didn't lose the zeal to get to the top of the wall.Later it succeded in climbing the wall.Likewise one must have persevarance to try and try until they succeed in doing the job they wish to accomplish.
Another person named Mc milan who invented cycle could not have invented it unless he tried several times.
In our day to day lives famous doctors would not have become surgeons simply by sitting and starring.They needed to pick up the scalpel and do the surgery.
Bypass surgery was done in a person and when the person had the problem with the heart the doctors had to come up with a new technique.Later they ended up in doing heart transplantation.All these would not have been achieved if the person simply didn't try 
During my childhood i thought i couldnot ride a cycle but later on i got courage and learnt cycling,later id didn't stop with that i learnt a motor bike.
if i would not have tried riding motor bike i would have ende up by simply learning cycling.later i managed to learn the car .
from these examples i conclude saying that one should not end up by getting a result for a job that he has done rather he has to take risk in his life and keep on trying to get new things done."
7159,0,"YES I AGREE WITH THIS STATMENT. SUCESSFUL PEOPLE ALWAYS TRY TO DO NEW THINGS.SOME OF THE REASONS I CAN GIVE FOR SUPPORTING MY OPENION IS GENERALLY PEOLE WHO ARE SUCCESSIVE TRY FOR THE BETTER RECOGNITION IN THE SOCIETY.THEY WILL NOT THINK THIS IS ENOUGH FOR US.THEY TRY TO CRETE NEW THINGS OR SOLVE THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE MUCH DIFFICULE .                	     IT  CAN  INCREASE THEIR EARNINGS AND THEY CAN BE WELL RECOGNISED BY THEIR  COLLEAGUESAND OTHERS IN THE SOCIETY.SUCESS IS GENERALLY GIVEN AS THEIR RECOGNITION.SUCESSFULPEOPLE WILL HAVE ABILITY TO SAND WITH WNY RISKS THEY FACE IN THEIR JOURNEY OF INVENTING SOMEWHAT NEW  WHICH IS USEFUL FOR SOCIETY.
            
                        SO HERE  THER ARE SOMEEXAMPLES FOR SUPPORTING MY STATMENT.MY FRIEND DID A PROJECT ON SPECIAL LIGHT REFLECTION THAT IS USE AS A CURE FOR CANCER.WHEN HE IS DOIN THAT PROJECT HE HAS FACED MANY PROBLEMS BUT HE DID NOT LOOSE HIS CONFIDENCE AND ABILITY.FINALLY HE HAD SUCEEDED IN HIS PROJECT.NOW ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAS DISCOURAGED HIM WANT TO PAY MORE MONEY FOR BUYING THTT PROJECT.NOW HE DIDNOT STOP HIS RESEACH  THERE.HE IS NOW TRYING TO DO PROJECT ON  TOUGH ONE  SO HIS MAIN AIM IS HE SHOULD BE IN THE TOP OF ALL OTHER SCIENTISTS IN THE WORLD.

                        SO I CAN GIVE ANOTHER EXAMPLE THAT IS ABOUT MYSELF.I DIDNOT DO BIG PROJECTS LIKE MY FRIEND BUT I DID A PROJECT IN MY SOFTWARE FIELD THAT I HAVE CRETED AN WEBSITE THOUGH WHICH PEOLE CAN LOON TO THE WEBSITE AND THEY CAN BOOK  TICKETS  TO ANY AIRLINES THROUGH MY WEBSITE.SO IT HAS BEEN SUCEEDED AND I HAVE NAMED IT AS SUNAIRLINES.

                       SO FINALLY I CAN CONCLUDE THAT  SUCESSFULLPEOPLE CANNOT BE STOPPED BY ANYONE BECAUSE SUCESS IS LEGENDARY."
943,0,"There is no doubt that everyone wants to be success,what are the personality and skill that successful people have and we don't have? Successful people are intelegant and independent. For me the most important personality to success is creative,as for brave,i agree with that,I think successful people like to try and take risk of new things.
    The fist tought I stand on this oppiean is they are not afraid of challenge,because of that,they will want to try anything new,ti find out which thing is better,they are not afraid to fell down,because they will stand up again.
    The seacond reason is the desire of success.If you want to be succesed,you must take risk in lots of new things,to find out which one is good which one is bad,find the good one to stand your work your bussiness,after that you will learn a lot from that experence,be stranger to face more things,that really makes you to be successful."
7017,0,"Nowadays there is a discussion about the youngsters.It is that recently, do young people give enough time to helping their comunities?In my opinion, young people do not give enough time to helping to their communities, as it was at past.At our time, there are lots of things that youngsters can waste their time with.
 Firstly, most of the young people are wasting time with computers.Computers were made for people's goods at first but then it starts to become a toy or a game machine and no one tried to stop it,because games are a seriously large echonomic resource for the people working in this sector.For example,young people can try using computer and internet for searching for the informations about their country's place in the world and feature predictions about their country.Further more this interest would make the young people more interested in their communities.
 Secondly, I think that younng people are not taking the lessons at their schools so seriously.There are important lessons given to the student at school about their communities like history and geography.In my opinion, every person, related to a community , should know his country's history.Also geography is an important factor for a person to help his/her community.These are just two factors for a person to help his/her community that the educations of them are given at school.Moreover school gives the education of loving your country, after your family.These are all well known by people,but, however, still people are not taking seriously and thinking schools as gamefields.
 Young people are like diamonds.You should shape them, otherwise you can not expect anything from them.They have to be shaped,if they are wanted to be the savers of the community.So if a youngster doesn't give enough time to help his/her community,it is also his/her family's fault."
2612,0,"the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide is very very fun. first you just start from the bigginig before you tarvel, going shoping with a big group of  friends. you buy a bunch of stuff for your trip, and at the same time your just having fun with your friends.  in just buying stuff,then while your at the airplane  you talk, take pictures from the plane with your friends too! then when you get to the place, lets say paris, you wanted to go there because you and your friends decides to go and because your going to have a lot of fun. then when you are there you start with you tour guide that is very borring, obviously you have to learn a little about the country your visiting ok, ill handle that but not every day, and then go visit all kinds of museums. after all that crowded day  at night we go ut with my friends in group, that the big deal here going to have fun with all your friends togeather, because your with people that know waht you like or do not like, and because its a very special trip for you in a big happy group. about a tour guide wasnt that fun because he  like your boss well not like your boss  seriously he just tells you what we have to do all day and what we need to visit. i could do that all that stuff but in a calm day with my friends.  but  i can handle all what the tour guides tells us to do while im with all my friends having fun, and  its just because im with my friends, to see how fun it is to be with a very big group you know well and can have a great time."
7107,0,"Travelling tops the list of many people's choice to spend their leisure time for. But whether to follow a group led by a tour guide remains a controversial question for the travellers at their planning stage of the tour. In my opinion, the best way to travel has little to do with following a large group.

People tend to rely on a group and stick to it for security or consensus or whatever they needed, but when it comes to travelling, things might fall on the opposite side. The assertion of unity means the denial of freedom, it is especially ture when, with the guide of a tour guide, one cannot indulge himself in the freedom of choosing what travelling sites to visit or what time to start and there is a greater chance that the true meaning of travelling, relaxation being my defenition, might be raped by arguments and complaints.

Some people would contridict my point by saying that a tour guide offers valuable and well-informed suggestions that would make a better trip. But isn't there enough news of tourists being cheated or made use of for the sake of tour guides' benefits? By saying this, I am not saying that tourist are more skilled at escaping tricks when travelling by themselves, nor am I judging the moral standard of all tour guides, it's just that isn't it even sadder to be fooled when certain investment and trust and already been placed on the tour guide?

In addition, travelling fullfills different purposes for different people. Some want to escape the hustles and bustles of the city, some wish to explore the unknown world, some aspire to adventure through exciting places,and none of these seem attainable by following the lead of a tour guide whose job is to keep everyone in sight and control.

Good or bad, there is no absolute truth, however, we always have the right to chase what we want when travelling."
4294,0,"There are a lot of people who think that young people enjoy life more than older people do.In my opinoin,I totally agree with this statement because the young have a more healthier body,also the world is new to them. 
We can not deny that the young have more healthier bodies which make they can enjoy their life much better.Nowadays there are many activities and sports for people to relax themselves such as the hiking,swimming.But these activities and sports have something in common,a good body.For example,the hiking request people being strong and full of energy.Even some young are not dare to try the hiking,so how could the older people?
Moreover,now many travels is not permitted to the people who have the heart diseases.As we know,it is a common diseases among the older.For example,once my family decided to go to Tibetan to have a journey,Unforturenatly my grand-father was not allowed to go there because of his heart diseases.
Many young people are curious to the new field than older people.Because the whole world seems to be new to him.There are a lot of food or sceneries they have never experienced before.But as to the older people,they are always stubborn and they do not listen to others' advices.When I asked my father to go to seaside,he always responced me that he was not willing to go.Because in his mind,the sea is no different although it is in the different areas and going to seaside would not appear him any more.But the young people never have this feeling.
All in all,from the reasons and example given above,we can easily draw the conclusion the young people enjoy life than older people do."
8502,0,"In these modren days the technology is developing rapidly, we are going in to competitive world with  very complex technologies so inorder to survive in this modren world  so one must have good knowledge of many academic subjects.

The broad knowledge of many academic subject makes the person to think more flexible as he get wide variety of knowledge, he can grow up to his own with out any dependencies, when we come to persons carrier it can be flourished and  has no limits only the sky will be.  When the person is having broad knowledge on differnt academic subject he can help out others with the knowledge and become a useful resource to many others. For example our proffessor mr john has wide knowledge on all the academic subjects that we have in this semister he can explain and help us out at any time and  the things said by him simple and esoteric, so one can acheive by having good knowledge on differnt subjects. This knowledge makes him to know that which subject sounds well and which is the interesting one and makes him to know the general awareness of all the subjects.

When we get into job then we need to work on differnt platforms just by knowing only one subject we cant survive in this world so differnt knowledge makes a person better and makes to get well adjust to the environment he is living more over there are some disadvantages  also by having the broad knowledge on different subjects the first thing is he cannot manage to have broad knowledge on differnt subjects its quite difficult for him, he cannot get specialized when he has such broad knowledge he can just emphazize on the subject rather than  revealing it.

When we come to this specialization on one specific subject that serves a big purpose for example consider doctor, a general doctor has just idea on the particular disease but he refers to specialist in case to heal it or to survivie the patient from it, so specialization is also equally considered important.

Finally i think both the strategies have equal importance the first one make more points than second."
1826,0,"""It is all about the club, makes your shot have a lifetime expirience""(wilson golf clubs) this was an advertisment for a golf club about five years ago. Why do I mention it? well I bought their product. In the modern world that we live in advertisment and marketing are everything inside a free market. Adverstisment is an important factor used by producers to sell their products, it makes the consumer become interested in the product and makes him most of the times buy it.

	  Bringing my previose quote again what I tried to show with it is that by just listening to a propaganda and its advertisment I became so interested in that club that I finally bought it. I was young and just becoming a part of a famouse hobby called golf. I wasnt aware of what brands were the best and so. So I just bought the one that called the most my attention ""Wilson golf clubs."" It had a great advertisnment wich assured me that its product will last foreever and that it will make my game improve as a whole. One year later it boke leaving me with no more than a memory. I asked myself why?

	Well in the business world companies want revenue for greater profits. One way of gaining it is by the means of advertising. If you have a firm that sells shoes who is just beign introduced to the market you imidiatly want money, through advertisment you can trick the consumer into buying youre shoes because they are top quality and they will never get old nor loose their power. Through this mean of business you can expand in the market and the only one who could get hurt is youre client with your crapppy product.

	The world is filled with advertisment cartels and so. We people need to be aware that what we are buying has a good quality because most of the times things arent why they seem nor said to be."
8184,0,"""young people enjoy life more than older people do"" , agree or disagree? what a difficuilt question. Thinking of the answers puts you in a closed circule, there is no definite one. 
""Enjoying life"" is not dependent only on the factor of age, despite that we say that ""inorder to enjoy life you have to feel young from inside"", for my opnion age is one of the least essential effects.
To approve with this statemant or not, first we have to clearify what is the interpretation of ""enjoy life"". I think that we do all agree that it differs from one individual to the another, depending on their characters, their goals in life, their aspects, opnions.. etc. 
Talking of my self, enjoying life means to me: travelling through the world ,to be in everywhere in the world and not only to pass by also to learn from it, to be interested in any new thing including every single field in life, to enjoy means to work hard on improving yourself, your socio-economic level, your intellegence, your personality, 
to enjoy means to introduce new people, because knowing new people encounters you with their life experinces, and that enriches your experince, and your thinking, your mind.
For me practicing all these things is ""ENJOYNG LIFE"", and not doing them means, for me, your are not living."
8263,0,"Yes it is true that successful people bound themselves in such a way that they are always inclined t do new thing and do traditional things in innovative ways rather than adopting the same old methods. I had been working with a lawyer who is very ambitious and at such an age i.e. 60 yrs. he is so energetic and filled with ideas that rare can challenge. There had been various examples in Indian history where people employed new techniques and tok risk and succeeded. One of such example is Sunil Bharti Mittal (AirTel) in the initial days when he was struggling, an idea of key pad phone clicked him, at that time India was not used to Key Pad telephone instruments. There were boring round mechanical instruments with out any features except to connect people. Then there came the era of Key pad phones and it was a revolution for India, many faclities were provided in those instruments. Though it was a hit and trial effort but it worked and it was the risk that this person took and made life comfortable. Then the era of Mobile phones came and now lots of players have come into operations and competing with each other. There is another success story of Maruti Car. Initially in India, i.e. after independence the car available in India was Ambassador of Fiat no other car was available in India except for the imported ones and that can be afforded by people with big pockets only. This problem was solved by Mr. Sanjay Gandhi who is the key person fr entry of Japanese Cars into India. Maruti in collaboration wth suzuki was ntroduced in the year 1984 and people welcomed it with great respect. though it was a risk taken by that person, it worked and today it has superseded all other cars available in India. This is how success stories begin and continues. They say sucess is a journey and not a destination."
2480,0,"I believe that both things are necessary. This is a great question and also it could be a big dilemma. Based on my own experience is how i reach this conclusion.

Nowadays i am dentist, but i just got my degree five months ago. While i was still in my fourth year of university, i came up with the same question. I was a very good student with high grades, but all i could talk to people about was teeth and the oral cavity. I even used to say, as a joke, that i had tooth-shaped brain!

I felt really bad about my reality so i looked forward to find an extracurricular activity that had nothing to do with dentistry. Thus i registered myself for the Selection of the Universidad Central de Venezuela in the World Model of the United Nations (WorldMUN). 

WorldMUN is an event organized by Harvard University with the purpose of gathering students from universities from all over the world, in order to discuss the current agenda of the UN; in other words, students play the role of diplomatics that defend the position of certain country, regarding an especific topic of real life. 

I have to admit that it was quiet hard for me because the training process implied to study and know many things about general culture, universal history and current world events, and those where subjects i was not familiar with at all. But after a huge effort, i finally got to go to Beijing, China in march of this year, with 28 other UCV students. The team got the first prize among more than 200 other universities from around the world.

That does not mean that i am not interested anymore in getting an specialization of my career. On the contrary ""i want"" now to do an oral and maxillo-facial surgery specialization.

So my conclusion is that someone does not need to be completely in favor of one option, i believe that one person can manage him or herself to have knowledge in many academic subjects, but at the same time, he or she can have a specialization.

The mind has no limits, you put the limits!"
6218,0,"We learn a lot of knowledge from school. Teachers usually teach us to understand ideas and concpets from books. We usually learn facts after we face it or after we get experience. I disagress this statement. I think that learn facts is more practical than understand ideas after we have job.
	I believe that learning facts is very practical and it will help us in the future. We usually learn concepts from books. We rarely learn facts from books. So most people learn facts after they have a job. Somtimes, people don't understand facts, so they get into the trobules.
	Here is an example, I have a friend. She just graduated from school last year. She used to work in a restaurant. After three months, she told me that the facts are very different from ideas and concepts. She couldn't realize why everything is different from books at begun. Moreover, She had a lot agreements with her boss ,and she got into trouble. She felt unhappy everyday. Therefore, she quti this job.	
	In conslusion, I believe that learning facts is more important than understand the ideas and concepts. I think that if my friend could learn facts in school or from books, she might not got into trouble and lost job. In short, learning facts is more important."
4185,0,"I think  is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects intead of specialize in one specific subject.
For example lets says that maria was invited to dinner and unfortunaly for her, she was the only youngest person on the table, so the other people would start talking about different topics and time to time maria would hace to disscus with the others, but if maria only has the knowledge for one topic, that would be embarsing for maria because she would be not able to answers or disscus with other people that had the knowledge that she doesnt have.
Currently in our society a lot of topics need to be discuss, another example would be referent to mathematics, we use mathematics all the time and daily in our lifes, but the word math not only envolves one topic, also is related to our daily life, when we go shooping we use math to buy thing and calculate the prize, or buying food. like i said math is not only one topic but is also related to everything that sorround us.
Nevertheless, a lot of people think that if they study for being a biologist ,they are also studying the enviromental life and some topics related to nature, animals and their behavior, also include math because they not only going to learn about the enviroment but also they need to calculate the population of animals, plants.
Indeed, we can see the importance of knowing more than one subject because is very usefull in our daily life, instead of specialize in one subject for those people that only had the knowledge in one topic or subject their lifes would be not easy than the others that at least have a general idea and they can discuss some of the topics that present in our daily lifes."
10255,0,"I partly agree with the statement that ""It is more important for students to under stand ideas and concepts than to learn facts."" 

Because students offen  read textbooks of certain school or collage and in those books we only read the lessons and come to an idea and learn what the concept is,rather than knowing the facts .
and coming to a chemical lab in our collages we require facts rather than ideas.

For example go for a lesson in an english text there we find n number of stories and by reading those we come to idea of what happened in the story ratheer than knowing the facts .And coming to the lab we know about the fact that which reaction will come by combining two acids or bases .Here we requirefact rather than idea .
So understanding ideas,concept and facts are helpfull to the students according to the subjects they are reading .so at perticular time ideas and concepts play a major role where as facts on the other time .

So,By these resons and examples i partly agree with the statment that It is more important for students to under stand ideas and concepts than to learn facts ."
11382,0,"""The more you know the better"". I do agree with the statement that a person must enrich his knowledge with many academic programs to enable him to achieve a greater level of success and finally be a well educated person.  A person who is familiar with  a number of different subjects or rather topics, is more able to communicate with the world around . Furthermore, the individual will practice and enjoy the essence of the material he studied when it comes to implementing it in real life situations.

	To start with, as a fact, a person's area of knowlege is unlimited, people can study alot of different subjects, if they have the will to do so. A person for example, who enriches his area of knowlege will be able to reach new sophisticated levels in life. The world around us in dynamic, it changes rapidly and people are not aware of that. A broad level of knowlege will help the person coupe with such changes, allowing him to understand and communicate with different people from different areas of the world. Knowlege is not only limited to only particular subject.

	Moreover, when you study a subject and do understand all important information as well as the idea behind the information given, then when it comes to real life situations and you have to implement what you studied, the feeling that you have achieved something great will cross your mind, and so you will be more keen to actually continue what you are doing inorder to achieve the greatest.

	To sum up, i beleive that all individuals are able to develop the area of their knowledge and to widen their horizon about the the many things taking place in life, because at the end it is you that will benefit from becoming successful. Learning is never to late."
4628,0,"""Jack of all trades and master of none"". 
Well yes! I totally agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.

I look at eductaion as primarily an aid to better living, enriching lives of the recipients with its vast and varied database. Life itself cannot be compartmentalised into few specifics. It is actually the amalgamation of a wide gamut of experiences, problems, oppurtunities, successes, failures, emotions, relationships and the like. Thus, to deal with such a vast range of things definitely requires some sort of formal education about the broad features of various academic subjects.

For example, for a home-maker, to successfully run and manage the house, only an education in basic cooking or rather the home-sciences is not enough. He/She needs also to be equipped with the broad details of mathematics, economics, social sciences, etc. to be able to better execute the responsibilities at hand.

Further I believe that knowledge of diverse domains promotes the all-round development of an individual. The person is much better aware of the socio-political factors affecting him and his surroundings and is able to make informed decisions about his life in particular and the society in general.  On the other hand, a specialist in a particular field might find it quite challenging to deal with issues that are beyond his domain. This will put him at a great  disadvantage as compared to the other generalists in his surroundings.

In terms of interpersonal relationships also, the specialists find it quite difficult to relate to people who are not from their field of study. On the other hand, having being exposed to a broad spectrum of topics, the generalists find it quite comfortable to get along with even radically different people. This helps in strengthening their contacts and improving their communication skills.

Lastly I feel that since we have only one life to live, we must make the most of it and fill up our lives with as many possible experiences that we may percieve so that we may not have any regrets on having missed out on anything in life."

In the first the article introdce the argoment reporting some opinions of student of my city. After have write down the opinion the autor speak's about whit disagree. My personal oinion is differet, in fact a broad knoeledge of many academic subject can help the student to find a job. The society present ""today"" is possible that have the necessity to change, or make more big their ""ground of action"", if the people present inside are specialized only in a singolar sector, they can't help the society to modify itself. The presence of dinamic dipendent, made the industry dinamic. This dinamic can generate a better response of the product for the populations.
At the same time, is really that the industry for response to the specify request of society have the necessity to have other sector less dinamic.
At the last, i think the in ""today"" society, the industry and the office have necessity to have the possibility to have all the category.
Today is very importand the dinamism for find the work, but is alredy very import is specialize to be create a good product or a good service. So i divide in two grops. The relationship beetwin thee two group is important to make dinamic the singolar group. The informations and the experience have to go in two directions: from the administration and from the production, only with this continuous relationships is possible give a good response to the society. The broad knowledge of many academic subject is the point of start for the dinamism"

                      In an age of managers,who are  generalists , who need specialists.Why would a company for example hire an employee with a specific knowldge of sales when he can get a person with a knowldge of all sectors  viz a viz sales , marketing , finance etc. for the same job , for the same money.Now a days every place we go or any person we meet tend impress us only if it is closer to perfect.As i said earlier i small error , destroys the emperor.

                      Leave about how the worlds takes you, think about your personal self. Would it not feel unsatisfied with what you have if you can or should have had when wanted.Its a little complex.Let us take it this ways , you have to go through the annual report of your company.Your colleague also gets it and at the presentation he outshines you in just knowing the facts by heart or take it the other ways round. Would you not feel sorry for yourself for not learning the facts or probably not understanding the ideas and concepts of the report when you could have done that.YES absolutely.

                     So here we are.Now we can really conclude that having the basic ideas and concepts are as much importance as knowing the facts and facets.Afterall its not just about completing the task it about compleating it perfectly"
4292,0,"I strongly agree with the statement ""It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject"".  A broader knowledge of academic subjects will lead to a better understanding of topics and problems that exist or may exist in society.  By possesing an interdisciplinary knowledge of subjects, an individual will be in a better position to understand the complexities of issues which are not static and may involve many disciplines.  

For example, a podiatrist who specializes only in his subject will be highly succesful in working with many foot conditions. But when faced with a specific problem, say an allergic reaction on the foot, he may not be able to find the answer in his specialized area.  That particular allergic reaction may be a secondary effect of a larger health issue, such as a disease that has caused the patient's immune system to be compromised, or something as simple as a neurological reaction to an unusual amount of stress that the patient is experiencing.  A broader range of knowledge in medicine will most surely aid in the podiatrist's understanding of the allergic reaction and in finding a solution to the patient's affliction.

Not only is this the case for medicine or science, but in any aspect of a  professional's career it is important to have a wide knowledge of issues related to his or her career.  A civil engineer is more likely to build a safe and useful dam if he is knowledgeable in the needs of the people, the weather conditions under which the dam will be susceptible and the geographical component of the land.  Many times disasters, such as the flooding of New Orleans, occurs because of this lack of knowledge on the part of developers and other professionals."
3118,0,"I am definitely not agree with the idea that asserts older people can not enjoy life as young people do. I will explain my reasons of course.
   First of all, I believe that older people know a lot about life. They have a lot of experience about life. This gives them a very significant advantage on doing the right things. It means that they can do the proper things to enjoy. They do not vaste time to see if something is enjoyable or not . Because they know what is fun, they will just do the things they like.  

   Second, although many people believe that older people does not enough energy as young people, this is not something totally true. If an older person take care of herself or himself then there is no need to worry about. Older people can do anything that they want, provided that it is safe. Of course some things may have some risks, but do not forget that the young people also have these risks. 
    
   Third, enjoying the life does not need to have the same meaning to everybody. Different people like different things. It is not something releated with age. While some people may find the literature as enjoyable, some other may not. For example, I am not crayz about football, but my little brother is getting mad at playing and watching football even just seeing the players. On the contrary, despite my love of literature, he has no interest on this. There is not a generation  gap between us. There is only two-year gap. In my opinion it reveals that age is not important to enjoy something. If a person wants to enjoy something, he or she will definitely find a way. 

    To sum up, as I tried to explain above, I don`t think that age matters in enjoying life. It is not the age that making the things enjoyable or not,but characters of people that makes the world enjoyable. If you want to enjoy the life, take my word for it, there are limitless opportunities to do so. It is up to you."

  We talked about  the  technology`s speed.But what about the real speed? For many years  technology`s main concern was always speed.In our modern world speed plays a key  role in  every field.Speed means time and time is cash.Speed means efficiency.Speed means so many important things nowadays.
  So what did  technology do about speed?We began our journey with finding the wheels.And then everything has changed.We invented trains.And then cars and then planes and now we have even space shuttles.But from all of these vehicles,cars are the most important ones.The use of the cars has increased during the years and now, nearly every people in the U.S have at least one car.Cars helped and made the things easier for us.But what will happen after two decades from now?Are we  going to use same old,slow cars?Are we going to use that kind of vehicle while speed will be much and much important?I dont think so.
  First of all,as i said before, speed will be much more important.And there are enviromental problems too.There are so many cars and they are polluting our air.Also there is a energy problem.Our planet`s limited resources wont be enough to support that much energy in the near future.
  From my humble point of view,the cars will be useless within twenty years.We will find and we will have to find much rapid vehicles,we will have to find ecologic vehicles and we will have to find vehicles that transport large masses and use less energy.Simply, we will and we will have to find more sustainable vehicles.Because we have to improve our selves and civilization and in the meantime we have to protect our planet."
3710,0,"I disagree with this statement. Actually it's true that understand ideas and concepts are important for students. However, even the students have those things, I think the learning does not work without the learning facts for the students.
When I was in Grade 7 and 8, I could not success with my study that much, because I did not try to study hard at the time. However, I was  changed my mind by my mother's words when I was in Grade 9. And I could think that I have to study and if I study I will get good marks than before. Since then I studied hard, and my effort was permitted from my teachers. And my marks was getting high like I have ever seen or I could not imagine before. When I got the report card from those teachers, they wrote some masseges for my mother about me on the report. And it said ""she changed a lot in this year. I knew that she is a person who have good unerstanding knowlegdes and nice learner, but she didn't try to work hard before. So her marks were low, but she tried to study so hard in this year. I felt she grew up little bit, and I am glad to see her many great ideas and imaginations and also I felt her good attitudes in those classes. I learned from your daugnter that even if we have good qualities, if we didn't think we want to show the qualities, the good qualities never get Great qualities."" When I saw the massages, I felt so happy and I thought I will keep studying hard for me, my family who support me, and those teachers who I got when I was in Junior High. 
From my experience, I think it is more important for students to learn facts than it is for students to understand ideas and cocepts."
9606,0,"I agree with the statement: 'Young people enjoy life more than older people do', although it was not such an easy question and furtermore it has neither an easy or definitive answer.
I believe that some (some, because it is impossible to generallyze in abstract themes as this one) young people enjoy life more than older people mostly because they have less responsabilities. As it is said: 'Those whom don't know anything, don't fear anything' which means that the less you know the less you have to worry about.  By example, a six year old boy needs to be feed and he worries about it when he feels hungry, buy he doesn't worry about who is bringing the money home to buy the food. So, he enjoys life by being satisfied on his basic needs and by being able to play and experience life at this young stage. 
On the other hand, older people, adults for example, generally have an income, they have money, they drive, they have an active social life and they can practically  do whatever they want... this, gives them a sense of freedom. 
I said before that this was not an easy question and either it was not easy to answer because it has many points to be anallyzed, so many that I believe it could be the topic of a professional research. There are many variables: what can we consider as young people (teenagers are a young segment of the population and they certainly don't feel happy alll the time) and what can be considered as old people (Very old people are most of the time sick; according to Jose Saramago: the old people lives going to nothing while the young people goes for everything). 
But,  in conclusion I think that is better to know many things, to be aware of what life has for each one -you can reach this state when you are an adult, even a young adult- and then enjoy life, knowing the advantages and challenges that life puts on your way to get almost anything: when something costs one a lot of work, it will appear to be better when it is obtained. 
So that: I am older than other people and I enjoy life more than some younger people."
1311,0,"Even if facts can change depending on the topic, it is very important for studens to learn them.In my opinion I would strongly desagree with this statement. Students always open their mind to learn no matter what is that they are learning. For a studen to make a good argument in a thesis or in a topic he or she will have to be able to have clear ideas and concepts, but at the same time learn some facts to support their answer. 

As an example to identify whether or not a student is using his/her knowledge properly would be what happened on September 11. When the two planes crashed on the two commerce buildings in New York. Some ideas could give the student some understanding of what had occurred on that terrible moment, same as some concepts that most people would give to describe what happened. But, for a student to clearly analize this incident some facts will have to be given. 

Facts are part of the history that we as human beings make everyday. No matter what happens around the world, facts will always be there to help us describe, understand and let us give our opinion. Not all the time students will have to learn facts as they will have to understand ideas and concepts, but in my opinion they might go together. 

A good reason for these three things to be together is that; you can not understand and idea without having a good concept, you cannot describe a concept without having any facts that prof it and you won't be able to fully understand facts if you don't know how to develop ideas and use your concepts. Another example will be Leonardo Da Vinci. He had to support his ideas and concepts by having facts to understand. What would have happened if he put to much red colour in Mona Lizas's lips? There is a fact that deals with the consequences of our actions. Da Vinci would have had to think about scientist facts before starting his new inventions.

The time will go by and we will all develop a new way of life. Our capacity to think will change for better and our way to study will have to change too. Until that time comes we must use our own resourses to learn and understand whatever it is that we are talking about. Always understand ideas and concepts and use your learned facts to make sure that what you are saying is right. Students always know what is the better way to learn."
2109,0,"I agree with this statement because a succesful person must be imaginative. This person has to take risks and must have a proffesional way of solving problems.  But the other type of person, who only solves problems with classic types, can not achieve in life because that person is narrow minded. In addition to this, the radical movements that a succesful person has made will open the doors of achievement. The ability to create is the same meaning to try new things. By this abilities, a person can absolutely do such things that no one has ever able to."
4702,0,"IDEAS AND FACTS

I desagree with the statement, because the facts are important as the ideas and concepts, the are connect because the ideas and concepts give the students the facts, they are always behind, in any explication and understanding of ideas and concepts, we have to consider the facts, to have a deeper reasoning about what we want to learn, but why some people not consider facts as important?

Many people think that the concept or meaning is the only thing that matters, because they are superficial and don't look behind to see the FACTS.
For example, in a high school, the students are only interest in learning the concept as it is, not to know what cause it, or why it is there, this lack of interest on going deeper on the information they have, led them to not be well prepare to present some knowlege tests, but also the teachers don't  pay attention to this lackness in their students, so the students only understant the ideas but not learn the facts that remarks that idea.

It is important to always have some facts, so that we can make a better analizis to the theory, that involves the ideas and the concepts, analyzing all the things we have in our head, to make a better job.
This doesnt mean that the ideas and the concepts are not important, thay are very important because with them is that we can take in account the facts, so undestanding ideas and concepts are very, very important, to have a clear thought of what we have.
This is like when a bird born, at the begining it is only interest or focus on the food the mother give him, but later needs to know the facts that involves how the mother obtains the food, how she procceses it, and how he can do that. Are things that maybe at the beginig it doesnt put attention but at the end would be very an important thing to him.

Can be concluded, that the facts, and the ideas and concepts, are both very important to have a better knowlege about something, that when we see the concept, we also have to consider the facts that are behind."
3525,0,"I agree with the statement of successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.In this society, I think that if you do not try news things, you would be just a worker but not the boss, because the boss need to have the ambition, confidence, and interest to be success.

                 First,ambition is the main point to let the people try new things. If you haven't the ambition, you would not try with new things and just only doing what you already know how to do well,because you have no ambition to accept the fault that you make or you have no ambition to accept you are not success. Ambition is a thought in your mind that gives conmfident to you and do the things. If you always escape to face to try new things, you would not get sucess any more.

               Second,confidence also really important to let the people try new things.Confidence and ambition are very similar,but ambition is internal,and confidence is external.For example, you need to attend in a competition of basketball,and you never play basketball before,you have the amnbition to try to play the basketball,but you do not have the confidence to attend in the competition because you have no confidence to win this competiton. Confidence not only create by yourself,also you have confidence or not is because of your close friends or family, if they are support you, you would have confidence to try the new things.

              Third,your interests of what you want to know also really important.For example, i need to apply in an University, and i need to choose the subject,and I am good in art,I want to be a art designer,which means drawing is my interest, if I get in the University, i need to learn the new things and skilld oif art, but this is my interests, although it is diffcult to learn,but i still would face it.

               At last,have ambition, confidenceand interests are helping me to be the successful people try new things and take riskd rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.If i am a person that dont try any new things and just odo somethings that i am always doing good, i would think the things bored and no success feeling on the things."
8292,0,"In our modern societies, individualism keeps growing. Because of this fact, the communities need more and more help. But nowadays, the generation of video games seems more preoccupied by itself than by their commuunities. Does it mean than young people do not help their communities anymore? In a first part, we will discuss the growing individualism, and in the first part, we will see how  young people help their communities.

To begin with, we live in societies led by capitalism. This system encourages the personal achievement, through the American model of the self-made man. Everyone has to fight for himself to realize his dreams, while at the same time, old or handicaped people, or even the family are alone, or in a bad situation. So, should young people sacrified time they would have put into their career to help these communities or not? 

However, our societies are also the societies of all the associations. In the last decades, many associations are born, living to help the communities. And it is often young people that work in them. For instance, the Association Habitat et Humanisme that help people to find a house by gathering funds is mainly composed by young people. Furthermore, more and more Schools and universities develop associations that help people. Helping communities has become a common fact for students. I also think that giving time to helping communities becomes more and more a strong argument in front of a manager, when a young people is looking for a job.

To conclude, I would say that I clearly disagree with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping communities. 
In the contrary, I think they give more and more time for them."
5265,0,"I think that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. In three reason, it can be proved, exazageration, repeating, and useing famous person.
       First of all, exageration is good evidence. Some company can not lie about the its production. However, they usually use other factors in advertisements. For example, there are many heathy people and they always smile in the madicine advertisements. Even though people usually get a medicine when they sick, the advertisements always shsw healthy and happy people. The consumer might think that they could be healthy if they get the medicine. But, it is wrong. This is exageration of advertisements.
       Second, many company usually use famous person for advertisements. If a famous person says "" This is good product. And I am useing this product everyday."", people believe it. People believe it because they are famous person. But, usually the product is not concerned with the famous person. People think that they can be nice if they use it. But it is wrong because it is just advertisement.
      Third, repeating is one of methods many company can use in their advertisements. When people hear a prase again and again ,usually people remember the word and praise. It is not necessory to say that they will buy the product when they see it. For example, my wife and I usually go to shopping together. When we see the same product which we saw in advertisement, we usually buy it. Because the product is only one thing that we have a information about it. Even thouth it is just the product's name or praise it often make an important roll in my decision.
       In conclusion, I think that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Because many company use exazageration, a famous person, and repeating, people buy the product."
11554,0,"Young People Enjoy Life More than Older People Do



 From my point of view, I belive the young and old people enjoy they life the same. There is time for everything and a moment.
 To understand peoples behaiviors, we need to see, where are they come from, what are they like to do, social and personal interest.
 For example; I born in Costa Rica , small country where young and old people enjoy soccer, and dancing, and are no different from others people or cultures around the world.  
 Younger people is more active and careless , they no have many responsabilities, so they use all they free or spare time, doing many things , such as : a)- sports , b)- travel , c)- dating, d)- working part time , e)- study. , hoping that something really works out for them and have some fun at the time. Many like my self, take some adventure and leave the country, try to find new horizonts and adventures.
 Older people the still have fun , and they enjoy they life in they way, becuse usully older peolpe have more responsabilities, such a family, childs, full time works or carries, they have less time to do what they really like, but that doesnt meant that they no enjoy they life.
 The meaning of enjoy life is in everyone , we all enjoy our life  in so many differents ways, and as long we belive that is correct , is ok.
 Be young or old is depent in each person, some people young are like old people, and some old people are like young people.
Enjoy life is a present from God, and we need to be gracefull just for be alive and see as much as we can of this work.
Enjoy life is no matter to be young or old , enjoy life is live life."

 Because now a days the price of the gas is becoming higher and there will be no gas in the future.  Some company started to make a hibrid or eco car, but it will not much the demand and many people can't buy such a expensive car with not finishing the loan of the car which thay have now.
 Also, now the global worming is the big problem in the world and the car use is the issue too.
But there is a problem too.  Because the way of transportation we have is just a car and a train.  So if people stop to use cars, there will be no way to transport, because train is already full with people."

understanding ideas are very nessary for students to answer and connect their ideas with their life.

4739,0,"I think that the advertisement is what really push you to buy something that you need, or think you may need. Because of the way the product is showed. 
Some advertisements show just the product advantages, but does not show the disadventages, so the client or the posible clients (you) are convince that is what you need, without serch for others products that offert the same porpuse but in differrents ways. Some times we buy before do any research in differents products of the same kind.
The price is something that really makes the difference, because if bysides the advertisement shows just the adventages and it has a really low price in compare with other products of the same kind, that really influens your desitions, because you always want to save some money, at least if you are a normal status person.
The advertisements are good to show you the differents kinds of products you can find in the market for a certain porpuse, always if they tell you the trurth.
Some companies just made their advertisements incompleated, as I said before they show you just the good part of the product, and sometimes they overfull you of their advertisements, so you will make your desition based on what you seen more often, You get to tell youself ""if you see it every where it most be good, so I will buy it"".
That is what push us to make mistakes, we can not leave our desition on the companie's hands, we have to do some research to make sure that what they are offering is what really is, and what I really need, otherwise you do not need to buy it.
So my adventage is that always make sure the product you are buying it what you think it is, you can check with friends of yours that had bougth it, or with different stores that sale it, do not let the advertisement convince you."
9187,0,"In my opinion, the term 'enjoyement' is very subjective. It is a state of mind which may be experienced both by the young and the aged. To the youth, 'enjoyment' could refer to socialising with their friends, partying, watching movies, adventure sports such as scuba diving. Whereas, to an old couple, enjoyment couls imply relaxing at home, spending time with family, taking vacations or simply spending time at an aromatherapy spa. So to take a stand on which age group 'enjoys' life more is rather difficult. However, if we define 'enjoyment' as the feeling of experiencing the 'high' of life, of taking full advantages of all the opportunities available to us today, then I believe, it is the youth which has more of an advantage.

The most important advantage that the younger people have is their health. Not to say that older people are always sick, younger people tend to be fitter , healthier and more energetic so as to be able to avail of more pleasures of life. Lets take for instance the example of scuba diving or trecking. It is most likely that a yound person would be much fitter to enjoy such activities. There are many cases where older people are not even allowed to participate in activites on account of risk of heart failure, unfavorable atmospheric conditions (para gliding) etc. However, many old people are fit to underatke these risks, they are generally advised not to.

Moreover, the youth has a zest for life which is not very often seen in the older generation. This is not to say that the aged dont appreciate life, it is just that the youth has more to look forward to than the elderly. What is unknown, always entices. To elaborate, the young look forward to all the things that are in store for them for e.g graduating, going to college, taking vacations with their friends, travelling the world. While on the other hand, the aged have alreday been through the various stages of life and are not particularly excited about the future. Infact most of them are more involved in the lives and problems of their children who are busy 'enjoying' life.

As one grows older, the weight on responsibility on ones shoulder increases. It is not possible for older people to take the same kind of risks the youth can take, may it be health-related, family related of even financial. Let us consider the case of a graduate student  and an old man who has a family of five. The student is more likely to splurge his money on enjomnet activities such as partying, membership os sports clubs, travelling than a man who needs to save his money in order to support his family. Thus it leads us to the conclusion that , younger people have fewer financial restraints than older who need to support their families

To conclude, it can be reiterated that 'enjoyment' is an highly subjective term and may mean different things to different age groups. Though our strict definition of 'enjoyment' does bring to light the facts that younger people ahve more time, money and energy to spend on enjoyment activities, the argument is in now way insulated from exceptions. Exceptions are always there is every walk of life and so there might always older people who 'enjoy' life more than the youth."
11132,0,"Im fully agree with The young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.
It's true because most of young people is so busy to helping out their communities rather than adult people , specially in korea , they actually live with many complicated thing for instance schools,and after school they most go to the campus,and study,they should go to the college at all.
 I think they don't even have their private time to spend.
But the valius ways, of course they have to concern with it, that may belongs to education .
Their definitly busy, but if in their heart ,if theres a little concern with communities, they 'll help communities by themselves.
however the young peoples of this century is not that nice actually.
its up to themselves but ; in my experience, they used to think about their friends and what they like to do.I meant,its just like an child who don't concern the future.
For develpmental of good things is up to how do they think about it.
of course somes tends to negative but somes are not.
and Im not sure few people would like to dedicate their goods for the community. thus , this problem will be better as much as inhavitants mind  are grow. 
however, most of young people wouldn't like to do something for the community,is the truth ,but I hope it will be better."
8422,0,"I agree that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than to specialize in one specific subject.
	First, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can provide a more practical approach to choosing the special interests of a person. This is because, if one specializes in one specific subject without having a broad knowledge in other areas, one will not be able to discern  his/her real area of interest. This is why students in most educational institutions learn math, language, science, social studies, art and others subjects intensely for several years at least. After having a firm understanding of these areas,  will then the students choose and study their special interests in universities. 
	Secondly, having a broad knowledge of many subjects can help people to become more flexible in their studies. For example, one of my friends went to a vocational school that specialized in science. However, her interests changed and she no longer wanted to study science. However, because she had specialized in one specific subject/area, she took double the time and made twice the effort in changing her field of study than I would have. Unlike her, I had studied a wide variety of subjects and so I could have been more flexible with my studies.
	Lastly, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects makes it easier to relate to people who have different interests or backgrounds. However, people who specialize in one specific subject might face challenges when trying to relate to a more diverse group of people. This will lead them to miss out experiencing many aspects of diversity. 
	Looking at the current educational systems and reflecting on past experiences, it can be concluded that having a wide range of study is more useful and convinient than a focused range of study."
6891,0,"Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well, because it will give them a new perspective for certain aspects.  Those people who do not try new things can never find the new aspects of life. For instance, trying new studies will help people to find their ability and starting new hobbies will give them a new, fun time.
     Starting unfamiliar studies is not an easy option, but the choice will lead to the intellectual improvement for people. For example, the peson who favors writing literature can find their hidden ability of completely another study. The person can start learning how to lecure to the audience, or students. It will emphasize his or her future choice. Trying to a new studies will trigger the discovering of potential abilities. Furthermore, staring a new hobby will lead people to have more fun time and pleasure. It can add the new tralents which will improve the people's abilit, and it can give he or she the meantal pleasure. For instance, a music person can find a new joy by starting sports such as, soccer, v. The sports also give a pleasant time; therefore, the person can ameriolate his or her life.
     Indeed, people who try new things rahter than staying their line can find better life and add their joy and ability. The new abilities will improve a person and widdens the future choice abd fun. Starting an unfamiliar studies or hobbies require lots of energy; however, It has positive influence on people even the tried thing are unsuccessful.

8031,0,"I agree with the opinion that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts. Some people reccomend to know the facts, but I think tstudents should understand them first because of the improtance of knowing the basic information, the possibility to misunderstand the facts without basic knowledge, and getting ability to think about cause and effect.

  First of all, students usually lean from teachers with textbooks because textbook have the important information for studnets. I understand that knowing facts is also somehow useful for students and they can learn other things which are not indicated in textbooks. however, it is more significant for students to learn subjects from basic.

  Secondly, I don't think students can understand the facts without basic knowledge. Not all facts have regular environment or situation like indication of textbooks, so students may misunderstand the facts which is irregular.However, if students learn basic knowledge first, they could recognize what is regular facts and irregular facts. Some facts require people to learn advenced knowledge to understand them, so it is more critical for students to study ideas and concepts first.

  Finally, if students know the ideas and concepts, they could think the cause and the effect of facts when they face the facts which they have not learned previously. Moreover, just knowing facts is not useful for them because facts are not always normal. Students can not recognize facts accurately without the basic ideas and concepts. Thus, I would like students to learn basic knowledge to understand facts.

  In conclusion, I believe that students should understand ideas and concepts first before learning facts. Not only students but also adults can not understand facts without basic knowledge. If they do not have them, they would misunderstand the facts. This is not good for students. Therefore I strongly reccomend students to study the basic ideas and concepts to recognize facts."
1793,0,"Advertisements usually make products seem much better than they really are. When a person walks down the street or is walking around in a mall, they are able to see all kind of flyers that exageratet the best characteristics of the products they are advertising making them look better than what they are.
	From my personal experience I can say that this is true. Once when I was around twelve a company called me to see if I wanted to do a comercial for a new cookie that was going to be sold in Panama. Since I was a kid and they were going to pay me, I said that I would do it, no problem. When I got to the place, they handed me a script, I was suppose to eat the cookie, and it didnt matter if it was good or bad but i had to pretend that I liked it anyway. I went to work with other kids that were going to make that cookie look good.
	When we started filming, instead of handing us regular cookies out of the box they were special cookies, these were taken appart and they had been added double fudge, so they lookked better, and they were made presentable by some guy who was fixing the vanilla fudge inside the cookie with a knive. Instead of us using normal cookies from the package, they had to make special cookies that looked better than what they reallt tasted, because i can surely say that the cookies looked good but they didnt really taste that good.
	Not only this happens with food but also with toys. For example the hot wheel comercial for kids look great. On TV you would think the cars are able to do flips and land back on track and keep going no problem, but once you buy that item, the thing falls appart. The wheels of the car start falling, it jumps out of the track to never land on it againa, and to put the track together is almost as hard as trying to build a rubiks cube.
	In conclusioin Items in advertisements always look better than what they really are, so people can sell them. This is a selling technique, but you have to be careful, because you can exaggerate what an item does, but you can make it up. Therefore, to be able to sell something, in the advertisement it has to look better than what it really is, and that is what people usually do, and based from my experience I think that is exactly what goes on."
1317,0,"I fully agree with the statement.

For me, the main purpuse of an advertisement is to show a product to someone (a person, a group of people, a company, etc) in order to sell it to the person.
So what other way to sell a product than show it the best way possible. And if the product is not so good or not that good looking, the only way to convince the audience that this product is worth buying is by showing it a tiny bit better than it really is in fact.

A great example that I have in mind  to illustrate this, is the following one: When you are waiting in a fast food, restaurent and you are looking at the pictures of the food you are about to order, you always see all the french fries lined-up and ''facing"" you. You always see the food displayed in those posters in a way that you have never seen it on your table.
The reason food is more attractive on the posters is that the servers, would not have time to re-arrange every french fry in order before you eat it. And of course, there is no way that a fast food brand displays it's fries just like it is in real life, because nobody would order it.    

Some might say that if the product is really good, there is no need to make it seem better than it actually is. And again, this is usually wrong.
Let's take for example a big brand. Whatever products they manufacturing, they will probably be another company out there that is selling the same product (usually a little bit different). In order for the first company to sell its product more that the competitor, the company needs to invest on a advertisement. And the main goal of the advert is to show that the product is better than any other one that looks the same or have the same functionalities. So basicly the advert has to show that the product is better than the other, so probably also better than it in fact really is. 

And finally, is a product is really good, there is probably nood need to make an advert in the first place as it will be a self selling product."
119,0,"First i would like to say that life does not stop at acertian age,
so i have to disagree with this statment.

But also i must say that there are somethings that old people cant do anymore, never the less there are even more thing they still can do, as long as the person is surounded by his loved ones,have a good hobby or still knows how to life in the eyes of his children he'll always enjoy life.

A young person could enjoy the things that the old persons had already enjoyed.

For young people a need for exploring, for going to places, for speeding from time to time, for there heart beatting faster and faster as they start to feel love in thier souls is a must.

For old people they've seen it all -or at least thats whats they're saying- they want the quit nights, the early sleep, the healthy food, and a vacation to an island that he always dreamed of.

For example a night of playing pingo with your friends and wife, going fishing with the child of your sun or going from time to time to your old work, all these things would mean the joy for an old person.

Where a young man or girl would feel bored if he / she had to do any of these things everyweek, he would rather be in a party or with his girl, or playing a hard game like football or basketball,she would rather be in the mall getting ready for the pram.

And in the other hand the life of young people is not suitable for old people, to party every time you could, to play and move all the time.

So every age has its own style, its own magic, its own ENJOY."
7445,0,"Young people nowadays often live in a society where education and work becomes a more and more difficult task due to high competition. Today's young people also live in a modern world with much more accessible distractions than before.

On the one hand, I think the society we live in has become highly competitive in all aspects. Since good education is becoming more and more accessible, universities, companies now require an even higher level of education. In my opinion, that is why some people now work harder than before.
On the other hand, the invention of computers, video games, and all the other different accesories made the young people of today much busier.

These reasons are why I agree with this statement in most cases. I think that young people nowadays simply don't have the time to help their communities. I also think that these young people are not to blame, modern society is.

If I talk about my personal experience, I can say that I do not give enough time to helping my community. One of the reasons why I don't is because nobody encourages me to do it. People around me are becoming less and less aware of the problems in their communities and are becoming more selfish.

I think it is also important to say that it is not 100% true that all young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. I think it applies more to rich and weathy countries. In the third world countries, I think people are more aware of poverty and as a result are less distracted by all the new technologies."
236,0,"Nowadays, cars are one of the most important features of our living style. They make our existence easier by letting us move from one place to another faster than walking. They also let us travel to places far from where we live which otherwise would be impossible to reach. However, cars have disadvantages such as the difficulties to find somewhere to park the car, the amount of money we spend on fuel and the pollution they live behind.

In my opinion, in twenty years there will be more or, at least, as much cars as there are today. But, the opposite could also occur. We can find evidences for and against both statements:

On the one hand, the number of cars have increased at an important rate last years, at least in the country where I live (Spain). The different sectors of the economy have had good results and the situation right now doesn't make us think that things will change all of a sudden. So, the trend we have observed on cars growth could be remaining the same and make the total numbers of cars in twenty years beeing bigger than it is today.

On the other hand, as cars are very polluting, lots of people have started being conscients about the damage we are causing to the environment and have started using public transports more often. In addition, governments are creating laws that restrict the use of a car in some cities or even they are taxing people who drive their cars in the city center. These facts could have as a result a reduction in the number of cars in the near and even the far future.

Anyway, public transports are not usually as good as they should be and a lot of people, specially those who live in rural areas, do really need a car to go to work, go to the supermarket, etc. Using a car is something confortable and we all know that people like to be confortable. So, I won't go as far as to say that the number of cars in the future will be bigger for sure but, at least, that's what I believe right now."
1164,0,"I agree with the statement as it says, the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. There are three advantages. First, as you traveling in a group led by a tour guide, tour guide will let you know every single thing you need to see in the journey. For example, if you want to go sightseening, a tour guide will escort you to the sight. The tour guide will be resopnsible whatever traveler wants to do. They just don' have to worry about reserving the resturant or doing some speacial activities. Espeacialy when they cannot speak English or German or whatever the languages are spoke in the country where they travel to. Second, since go traveling with group, they will definately get along with each other and have fun. If traveling alone, it won't be able to have much fun as traveling with group. Third, traveling a gourp with a tour guide is much more safer than traveling alone. Of course a tour guide knows about the location where is not safe enough to go so they won't go to the dangerous side of city. 
Ever since transportations developed amagingly, the world gets closer. We can go to the another side of world by airplane in ten hours or it may take a day to get there. It used to take about two, three months to get to the other countires. The world is getting more dangerous, most of people have guns and knife. so traveling with a tour guide is very helpfull to the traveler.
In my experienses, I have gone to Australia by my own. It was still scary to go there by self. Espeacialy in town side. When I went to town, I lost my wallet. i didn't lose my passport, thougt. So ever since I believe traveling with a tour guide is better and safer."
2178,0,"The mobility of society is a topic which is often discussed: in newspapers, in politics, but also among friends. Should there be less cars to decrease pollution? Yes, there should, but in my opinion this will not happen in the next twenty years. On the contrary, I think that the numbers of cars in the world will stay the same or probably even increase. Different reasons such as the need for mobility, improved road conditions, a better economic situation in developing countries and the growth rate of the population will lead to a constant or even higher amount of cars.

First of all, mobility is one of the most important points for modern society. Also in twenty years, this wish for mobility will still going on. People still want to be mobile, to reach everything within  a shortest time period. As it is, cars are the fastest medium of transportation, at least for short distances. Thus, the majority will not be willing to give up his or her car only to decrease pollution.

In Switzerland, there is a lively discussion about improving and extending roads to absorb all the traffic. Also in other countries, these measurements are of high interest. If there are more and better planned roads and therefore less traffic jams, even more people will think about buying a car and using it to reach for example their work place. 

Considering developing countries, they hopefully will have improved their situation in twenty years at least a little bit. Less poeple will live in poverty, and more will be part of the middle class. This positive development also leads to a higher demand of cars, because a car is a symbol for having enough money. In developing countries it is even more important for people to show how much they earn and therefore to climb the social ladder.

Finally, the simple fact that the world population in the whole is growing indicates that there will be more car owners in the future than now.

The growing demand for mobility in Western countries as well as the longer the more in developing countries leads to a higher number of cars in the world. This development is supported by the fact that a lot of countries are thinking of expanding their road system. Thus, it cannot be thought about a decreasing amount of cars in the future."
2704,0,"Everyone lives in a communty that consists of peoples, In which, all the people, old and young, are supposed to join the community activities, and to help their community in many of aspects. However, nowadays, It is argued that young people do not contribute to their community than in old days I agree with this opinion, since I believe the young people do not have enough time, do not have enough chances to communicate with others in the community, and also lack of the good motivation to help their comunity.

First, the young people now experience more presssure in their job and study than before, they have to work very hard to compete their peers, which make them really lack of time to have other activities insteading of working or studying. They spend all the time in the classrooms or office. And even when they go home at night, they will be so tired that can only go sleep at home instead of going outside to help their communities.

The other reason is that, nowadays the communities in human society seem have less chance for the people, especially for the young people, to communicate with each other. For some stupid reaons, such as security, all the buildings in the cities are built like prisons. All the doors are locked so firmly that even the mice couldn't get in. The people living in these ""prisons"" are usally not familiar with their neighbors even their are living in the next doors. This makes the young people do not consider their community as their own, and thus might not show up publicly so ofte. That's why they don't even have the chnace to help their community.

Finally, the people of all society, including the young people of course, become less and less motivated to help their communities. As the economic development of our society, the people more and more focus on money as the value of the life, while disregard the good reputation they might earn from the society. Usualy the young people will obtain nothing except some apreciation form their community if they do contribute to it. This make them feel valueless to help the community, and thus spend less and less time to take part in the community activities.

To summerize, the young people indeed contribute less time to help their comunities, and I think it's the problem of our cultrure nowadays, which actually encourage the people disregard their communities, and do not allow the people have enough time to paticipate the activites of their communities. I think it would be better for our future, if the young people can do more for their coummnities."
11283,0,"Cars play very important role in our lives.Although they cause a lot of  problems, for examples, traffic problems and pollution,they still one of the most convenient tool for us.I cannot imagine if we dont have cars in our lives, what our lives will be. In twenty years, we may find solution to deal with the problems,wich are caused by cars.However, it doesn`t means cars will be fewer in use than there are today. 
First, as the main economy support, cars are very important to many countries,not only the developed countries,but also the developing countries. Now, the consumption of cars is increasing in many developing country.For example,  china,according to a report for chinese consumption this year, cars become the chief production for chinese to spend money on.More and more companies to sell their cars in China than before.China has a large number of populations in the world.As a result, there will be more cars in use in the future.
On the other hand,although we can use other trasportations,such as subways,electronic buses,even bikes,which are common in china, we can not ignore the great use of cars.Cars are no doutly the most convenient tools for us.We can drive car anytime to anywhere. Unlike subways, which has limit of places, we can reach where we want to directly and without time restrict.
It is true that cars cause many problems, one of the biggest problems is pollutions.I think with the improvement of science techonology, cars will become more available than today.In fact, a lot of country and companies devote large amount of money to reseach new cars wich will reduce pollution effectively.
In sum, cars will not be few, but more in use in the future.Because they are the primary economy support and most convenient and necessary tools for people`s lives."
6599,0,"This question has two answers for me, because I agree and disagree at the same time. I will first tell you why I think it is better to be specialized on one subject, and then I will explain to you  why for me you gain more by having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects.

First of all I have to say that if you know a lot about a great deal of subject you can not be a specialist in one subject. You can talk about a lot of thinks, but you will keep on talking about the basics of those thinks. You would not be able to go deep into a conversation.

However on the other hand I think it is more interesting to learn about different topics. I do not think your brain is limited to a number of knowledge, so for me it is always good to learn new things. The more you know about things, the more you are open minded. I personaly think it is very important to be open minded, because then you become more tolerant, and you accept more, and learn more again. If you know a large range of things, you are also able to talk about more things, so you are not left over on certain conversations. 

In my opinion it is very important to be curious, to discover and to  experiment a lot of things. The more you do, the more you learn, and life become more interesting. However it is also necessary to be specialised in one subject. When you are specialised you become more precise, and you can go deeper into the subject, it become more interesting than to stay on the basics of one subject. Like everything in life it is a question of balance."
11439,0,"I disagree with the statement, that is, I insist that in twenty years there will be more cars than there are today. I have two reasons. One is about the continuous constructions of roads, and the another is about the conviniences of using cars.
   The first reason for me to disagree with the statement is that the construction of the road for cars are continuous. It will make the benefits by using cars widen more and more. Although of course I agree that the construction of roads are often connected with the intents of politicians who are eager to earn money by producing too many roads, and it often said to lead to the damages to environment, these constructions cannot help continuing without the dramatical change of laws that restrict these behaviors of politicians, which I think will not occur in twenty years.
     The second reason for me to disagree with the satatement is the convinience that cars bring us. By cars, we can go exact place where we want to go to, while for example trains can only brings us to the ""station,"" which might be very away from the place we want to get to. As shown in the fact that roads are so widely spread in the world, we are so benefited by cars that we can't stop using cars. So, it is easy to see that claiming bad effects cars have, such as polluting air, even though these effects are important enough to carefully think about, won't be able to stop us using cars in twenty years as we aren't now.
     For these two reasons, I disagree with the statement and insist that the numbers of cars will rather increase in twenty years."

7237,0,"I do not agree the opinion of  that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping communities.I argue that this opinion is not true  for tree reasons.
First,I think that all youngers are living by suporting each other. Though my experience, my friends always helped me when I got  troubles.Even I was supported by my fliends more than my friends.I can say that if I did not have any friends,I could not get over the so many problems that I had in the past. Of course when my friends are in trouble, I try to help them. We have learned the importance of frieds and support each other freom thouse experiences.
Secound, in the public, I see so many young people who helps eldery people. For example, people give up their seats and give them to old people on trains,buses or on any public ridings.In addition, some people carry  havy bags for eldery people in stores.
Tired, in my school, when someone breake his legs, arround his friends  help him by carring his stuffs or leading him. Or when someone is appcent, his friend takes notes for him.
I believe that all young people know  the importance of helping other people and everybody helpes their communities."

They are  generally egocentric,self centered who have apathy for the other issues which are taking place with out involving him. So any problem in the community doesnt make him to think about the issue. young people now adays are doing any work if there is any material gain in their work.
                                                              We know that from generation to generation the people have changed and the relationship between them also changed.As, the world is devoloping lot, there is more competetion in the world.So, the young people spend much of there time how to evolve victorious or successful in this competitive world. 
        Young people are generally over ambitious. so, they fail to understand in the sociable relations and fail to be amicable or convivial. They spent a lot of time in schools studying over the vast syllabus eating away all the time and energy. They dont even sometimes have time to do their work properly because of the hectic work schedule.
                       As many of the young students prefer to be independent rather than depend on adults for money for their expanses. so, the individualism also have an indirect impact on the young people for helping the community. So, the people will be busy in getting money by doing part time jobs in the night or any time when they are free. This keeps them restricted in involving themselves for the community help.

11514,0,"In my opinion it is true that teenagers and young adults do not provide enough time of their recreational time to contribute actively to their communities. There are three points to look at why this development has taken place in the last years.

First of all, it is obvious that the young people are facing a overwhelming selection of acitivities and entertainment platforms. Whereas our parents had no other choice than helping their communities because it was traditionally and morally imposed by the society and also there was nothing else to do rather than this, young people have a great range of possibilties how to spend their recreational time. They can choose between a wide range of physical, artisitc and cultural activities. Most young people do not only limit themselves to only one activity, they even attend to several. Hence they do not have any time left to provide to their communities.

Secondly, the society has been changing over the years and the development  tends to lean towards individualism rather than communalism. It is of utmost importance to be outstanding and perform extraordinary in order to stick out of the mass. It is not important to look after each other or to help each other, it is more important to ensure one's own life and well-being. You can find this phenomenal of indiviualism throughout different social classes. Since the young people grow up in this kind of enviroment where it is essential to perform indiviually, they do not experience the benefits of being part of a community which can back you up in any circumstances. For them, helping their community seems like a burden.Therefore, they are not willing anymore to contribute anything to the communities.

Furthermore, there is another point which has to be considered why teenagers do not participate at their local communities anymore. Many communities are outdated and do not know how to promote themselves in a appealing way. If the communities would possibly agree on rejuvenate their image and improve their programs"
11877,0,"In this statement of choosing if will be fewer cars use than there are today, i think my answer is there will be fewer cars in some places in the world and some other places staying the same of even increase the car using. The following points are my reasons for my opinion.

The first reason is different countries require different uses of cars. We know that in the world today,  there are different levels of countries. What i mean is there are developed countries and developing countries or even poor countries. Different countries require differents uses of cars like China. China is such a big country and it definitely require lots of cars as it got the biggest population in the world. Some small countries like Tailand or Canada, they got maybe just one ten of the populations as China, therefore they might have less uses of cars all the time long.

The second reason i think is because cars make too much polutions. There are millions or even billions of cars in the world. Everyday we see cars driving on anywhere as a city living people. In some big cases like HongKong, Beijing, NewYork, these are major cities in the world and certainly as too much cars inside there will be more poluted gas coming out. People can easily get sick by those gas as it originally come by oil. Also the plants out in the nature and all kinds of enviroment. As people start to realize it is important to protect the nature enviroment, i think that some countries will reduce the uses of cars in the following years. Besides thoes who did a good job of protecting the enviroment and they need car uses, these countries might keep their numbers of uses of cars.

The last major reason for my answer i think is about the new technology. Today we can almost see computers anywhere in the world, we can see many differents kinds of inventions coming out. These new things are invented for helping human beings to live better. I surely to say that it will do same on the cars. In many developed countries like America and England, German. There are always new productions coming out, there is now already a kind of car can use by no gas and just by water! The resource is something we can get easily. Anyway, my opinion is that as some powerful countries can do very good on inventing, they must reduce the old type of cars before.

In a word, cars are still important in some of the places in the world and some of the places are getting rid of them. It depends on how you want to use cars and the most important thing related to it, which is the environment."
4589,0,"Unfortunately i  agree with the statement because young people are not effectively so much helpful with their communities.
Actually the most of young people think that if you do something in order to help your community, such as going for a walk with elder people, you are not considered normal.
The conception of normality is not useful in this case. In fact while it should be considered normal if you give an hand to person who need it, you are defined as normal only if you show that your not interested in actions like these which are more significant than doing only the things that you want to do for yourself. The problem is that most of young people have an individualistic way to live their life.
They do not think that it is possible to share time between fun and helpful actions.
Personally i have not met many helpful people so far but one of this is my girlfriend. She decided to work as a volunteer in order to help people that cannot do every day actions because of their age or their disabilities. She goes each day to the same person. For this reason she has also built up good relationships with them and she assured me that it is an experience that she never felt in her life and it is not boring as most of the people think. They can transmit to you their volunty to live as they did when they were young.
In the past i also thought to wirk as a volunteer during a few hours per week, but now i am attending the second year at Bocconi University and i faced some difficulties to share my time between the school and this possibility.
For this reason i hope i will be more helpful for my community in the future than i am now."
1549,0,"Generally speaking, advertisements make products attractive and desirable.
	Let me start from scratch, what is the point of an advertisement? It is of course to make sell. And why would someone buy an object if it seems useless and uneffective? As a result, advertisment naturally tries to make a product look interesting.
	It is true that consequently, advertisements sometimes make a product seem much better than it really is. Sometimes advertisements lie. Yet it is not necessarily in its own interest to lie to consumers since they are not so stupid, and once a consumer finds out that he had been betrayed, he will not buy the product of the advertisement anymore. It might get even worst : the betrayed consumer may not buy any other products of this company. That is why, advertisements must  be careful about what they are claiming, and they ought to win the consumer's trust by simply telling him what the true advantages of such or such product are.
	Yet, it is also true that advertisements tends to emphasize the pros of an object and to hide its disadvantages. This is  the implicit rule of business. Unfortunatly, in occidental societies this rule is a general  principle.  One cannot avoid it. So one must not be gullible. For these reasons, I am not shocked by advertisements even if they are false. One must simply be careful and read magazines about products that he wants to acquire.
	Besides, I believe that advertisement is a everyday enjoyment. It is part of our lifes, and i do think that they are some advertisements that are very well done and that are very enjoyable, even if they lie a little. I prefer an intersesting but lying commercial than a realistic boring one. Anywaym the main goal of advertisements is to ;ake a product known right?

Understanding of ideas and concept play a vital role in a student life. Many benifits are atteched with understanding ideas rather then learning them.
Firstly consider the development of the mind of student. Understanding ideas and concept will inculcate the new ideas in the mind of the student. If he began to understand somthing it will develope his interest in that topic.The student will then spare his most of the time in thinking about that concept and solve himself many of the problems and quarries. Whereas a student who oonly lean the concept do not understand that will only get theoritcal knowledge. Such students always believe in spoonfeeding only. They never try to give little stress to their mind.

Third and most important thing is that learning will not lead to the logical development of the students whereas who try to learn by understanding has a very good logical power. Leaner will always get stuck with very small problems and always ask for the help with thers where as those who unerstand the ideas are able to solve big problems.
Those students who understand the facts and ideas has a very bright future and do well in life. Those who only learn  facs"
1855,0,"Cars are the symbol of the access to a better life for a lot of people because they have the felling to be free to go everywhere they want. However,  car has no future's life in front of all the new technologies in communication ans interaction. That is why I am convienced that there will be fewers cars in twenty years.

My first reason to belive this is that, in twenty years cars wil representate too many disagreements. For example, today, a lot of streets of big towns like New York or London are really overcrowded. The streets are becoming too little for all theses cars. For instance, it is more difficult to go outside Paris, in the subburbs, than take the plane ans go very far from France. In twenty years, I think all big cities will be like London. Actually in London, you cannot enter in the city without pay a right for entrance. This solution express that people really want to reduce the numbers of cars into big cities. In addition, that is why every big cities develop the buses or the subway, which is really more confortable for people who have to across the town everyday to go to work. As far as I am concerned, I prefer take the subway because I do my travel in less time than if I need to take the car. In my opinion, this solution to develop in big cities subway or buses wil be developed as far there will have no more cars in cities.

Furthermore, I think that we must take into consideration the developement in twenty years of new technologies. First of all, we realize today, and more in twenty years, how the pollution is damagable for the environement. And cars are one of the main reasons to explain this pollution. That is why we really want to promote some way to travel which respect more our planet. In twenty years, I am convinced that we will have new way to travel, faster and with less pollution. For instance, in some little towns like Bordeaux (in the south of France), there is the tramway, which allow people to across the town without breath the cars'pollution. I think that is a really good experimentation. Morevoer, in twenty years, we use more and more planes. Indeed, planes are becoming less ans less expensive and I hope than in these time, all peopkle can afford it. That is why I argue that in few years, all people use traway or subway to across their city and use planes to across some countries.

Tu summaruze my point of vue, I am really convinced and I hope also that there will be fewer cars in use than today. In few years, we have a lot of new way to travel, without wasting all this time in our cars and, by the same way, we have the opportunity to save our earth."
1435,0,"There has been a continuous change in the world for several years. I think that the ongoning chage will continue for the following centuries. The changes will have particular effect on daily subjects like transportation, work life, education system and so on. In the light of this idea, I definitely think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. Actually there are three main reasons that will cause this decrease.
  First of all, the oil reserves on the earth has been decreasing. The decrease in the amount effects the oil prices. Even in the last 3 years the oil prices increased dramatically. I think that, this increase will continue according to the decrease in oil reserves on the earth. As the price of oil increases, the number of people who can afford a car will decrease and the total number of cars will diminish.                   Secondly, I think that cars are not a good way of transportation and in twenty years, other means of trasportation will be invented. The cars are not feaxible to be used in both over the sea and in the air. As the requirements of the humankind increases, they will search for more flexible means of transportation. For instance, flying vehicles can be invented in twenty years and that can be very feasible to used. Therefore the car requirement will decrease and there will be less vehicles called 'cars'. 
  Lastly, by the spread of internet and its tools, the requirement for transportation may decrease and as a result the number of cars can diminish. Since internet is widely used both in our transactions and eduation, in twenty years, students attending their lectures from home may increase. Actually, this system has already been started to be used in several countries and appreciated by the users. Furthermore there is a new consept called ""telecommuting"" which means doing your job at home by means of phone, internet and fax. This system is very suitable for several jobs today. 
  To conclude, I think that the use of cars will decrease in twenty years. According to the decrease in the oil reserves, increase in the requirements of flexibility and spread of internet all over the world will have particular effect on the number of the cars in the traffic."
10985,0,"For beginning this essay, I just want to ask a question. If you win with a game 100 dollars, you will be happy, it's obvious. Now, if with a game, you win first of all 200 dollars, and afterward in the same game you lost 100 dollars, eventually you will win 100 dollars, but will your feeling be the same in the two cases ?

The really thing which is very important, is not a situation at an precise moment, but the evolution which lead us to a situation.
Thus, even if we are in a very good situation (in work, family or friends), and this situation stays like that for a long time, our feeling will not be the same, because at the beginning there is a changement which do that we are happy, but after there is not thing which influency our life, so we take the thing differently.
For example, we can quote, Richard Branson, who has a successful life, but he tries new things all the time, like diversify it company (Virgin), or things more crazy like do a turn around the Earth in balloon, travel in the space (not yet do, but maybe soon).

By all means, there is also people who prefer don't take risks and stay in the same situation. I think that there is not many people in this case, because if there is not evolution in our life, it become boring. Obviously, there is some situation exceptional where it is not right. For instance, I don't think that Michael Schumarrer (ex F1 pilot) was bored by the fact that each year during five years he won the championship. But it is a special case.

For me, the most important in the life is the evolution, to come back to my introduction, obsviously I think that we are not in the same feeling in the two cases (besides, some studies show that it is right). So, I agree that people (not only successful people, but in particular) try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know to do well."
668,0,"As the knowledge about science  is expanding, specialization is the result of this expanding. A man can read a lot about a subject but this will be his habbits about an topic.  This is the Filling of spare time, A man can only do on thing or job well but has lot of habbits. 
	Spesification about medicine could be the example. The medical knowledge we have reached today is enormous. A medic can not have all the subjects about medicine experienced. As it is so, it will be superficial and will have less benefit for his or her patients. Thats why medics try to graduate on paediatrics, oncology or cardiovascular surgery. As you uppergraduate on any subgroup, you should know that subject more deeply. 
	But as stated in the first passage, A man can only do one job well, the habbits of him also has supporting effects on his job. As a result, a man also needs habbits, that will support his job. As a result, for this century, spesification is highly required for benefit."
6298,0,"Nowadays, the development of communication makes the working at home possible. That might be a reason that some people say that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. However, I disagree with it. The reasons will be shown in the following.
 Modern people regard private life as important. In other words, they love to enjoy life, and car is necessary to do so. In my parent's generation, it was common to buy home earlier than car. However, people of my generation tend to buy car first when they get jobs. Therefore, the number of cars in twenty years will not decrease.
 In addition, there will be enough energy to spend in the future. Although there are not enough fuels in land, there are still huge oils and gas in the ocean. Moreover, the automobile that can be operated by electric energy was invented. It is just being advanced to be used by people.
 Finally, there are many countries that are still developing. For example, China, the country in which a major population of the world is living, is developing dramatically. It is necessary that the number of cars in China will increase. In addition, there are many countries that are developing like China: India, Russia, Brazil, etc.
 In conclusion, the number of cars will not decrease in twenty years. The importance of private life is increasing, and there are enough fuels and many developing countries. For these reasons, I believe that there will be more cars in use in the future."
3135,0,"I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Nowadays, advertisements are every convinient. We can simply stay our homes and buy anything we want without going anywhere. However, we should know that advertisements are not only for customers, but also retailers. In order to sell more products, advertisements make the products seems better than themselves. Eventhough they do not want to buy them, retailer let them consider buying the products. In my opinison, the reasons why we think the products are actually better than themselves are, inaccurate estimations, skilled retailer`s saling.
	First, we have a lot of way to get information, such as internet, or TV shows. Since these are immediate enviroment for our modern society, the advertisements affect us a lot. However, beause of the well established network, customers tend to buy the products without seeing them. If we do not see the product, less likely estimated accurately. For example, e-bay is the major shopping tool these days. We buy products without seeing them. I have a experience that the test I bought seems like intact from the picture on the internet, however, it was water damaged. If I could get the text at bookstore, I will not have this kinds of problem.
	Second, there are many well developed way to sell a products. They know what the customers wants. They like to buy a nice product with unexpensive price. It can be less expensive than reasonable price.  The retailer use discounts or limiting number of selling products and try to attract customers attension. In this moment, customers tend to think it is reasonalble or not rather than it is good products or not. Therefore, the price of products distruct the customers` attension toward price. 
	To conclude, beauce of inaccurate estimations and distructing by the price of product, we seems buy products wich are actually not as good as they expected. Therefore, we should aware of what we want, and what we need. We should think twice that advertisements are not as good as we think.  In this way, we less likely think that advertisements make products seem much better than really are."
3842,0,"It is usually said that life is short and nobody should waste his time. I think that it is talking about both young and older people. However young ones are physically capable of having more enjoying experiences than older ones so does it mean that young people enjoy life more than older people? Not really to my mind.
The priorities of both are totally different , for instance young people can enjoy highschool or college and what goes along (parties, trips, human experiences) nevertheless older people would actually enjoy having time for themselves or those they love. 

If we take a grand mother as an exemple, she mainly worries about her grand children and her children, she enjoys witnessing her grand son growing into a remarkable person. Older people are more concerned about their own family instead of their own satisfation and that is what makes them happy. Of course she still takes care of herself and has her own way to entertain herself however it will not be the same as when she was still in highschool, she might want to become gardener or travel all around the world, but her needs are more cultural and family-like than those of young people

Now, if I take a sixteen-years-old boy, it is significally different. Indeed his first concern is his own satisfaction although he also cares for his family. Nonetheless he wants to have fun with his friends going out or playing sports. His needs are personal and simple. He just have to seize the day without having to worry about his salary or his electricity fees. He is not responsible yet so he is enjoying life without having the same concerns as an older person.


To conclude with, I would say that both enjoy life as much as they can even though there still are exceptions. This does not apply only for teenagers and aged people but also for every category of ages. Eventually, a teenager will grow and change, so will his interests and his way of enjoying life."

935,0,"In all compagnies of productions, people use advertisements to make a product to look better than they really are. Advertisement, it is a kind of subtutition that people add to their product to change the naturel face of the product which will look better. Here are three major reasons why i am agree whith this statement such as publication, the beauty of the package, and the ingredients. First, while i am talking about the publication of the product, i am refering to how people publish the product once when the product is ready to be on the market. To publish their products, they have many way such as to present an emission on the tv about their products, to write an announcement in the journals, or to distribuate their product in different sompagnies which will help them to sell quickly. They also have to put a nice decoration and a good publicity, so when a clients see that, theyh can be attracted to that product. This reason is very important because it helps the clients to have more desire to buy this product. After, the beauty of the package is also important because you have to have a good knowlegde in order to create a nice, pretty design on the package of the product to make the products seem much better than they really are because this can also attract the clients. For example, if you look the package of one cereal ""Capitain Crunch"" which is recognize in the whole of the world, you can see how people draw on this package to attract the clients to have a desire to buy the cereal and also give them a good appetit. Then, ingredients are some kind of subtitutions that people add to the naturel products to change them  to look better than they used to be like colarnts and many others things. For Example, the cereal has many subtutitions on it like corns, colorants  to loopk very good to eat. In c"
4398,0,"It is often accepted that young people enjoy life more than older people but I quite disagree with this view as it is merely associated with the concept of having no responsibility.
Indeed, the ways young and older people enjoy life can be very different and it has nothing to do with having responsibilities or not.

As a matter of fact, young and older people haven't got access to the same activities as they often depend on your physical abilities. The fact that younger people are, most of the time, healthier than older people means that, for example, young people could enjoy playing a soccer match whereas old people could not. Moreover, it would be harder for a Senior to spend every night in clubs without sleeping.

Fortunately, enjoying life is not restricted to sport activities and older people could enjoy other aspects of life like building a family, creating business relationships, take part to the city or the country social or political life. These kind of activities can definitely bring a lot of happiness and maybe more fulfilling than simply play tennis or spending nights in bars.

Another important aspect is that older people may value life more as they might have been in contact with death of relatives. Therefore, they might even enjoy life more than younger people as they know their time is limited. On the contrary, young people are not in direct contact with death and just do not realize what is at stake. They might then just live life as it comes and not get the most of it.

As a conclusion, young people and older people can both enjoy life in different manners. Happiness is not a question of age but of perspective and I am sure that anyone, young or old can enjoy life if they are ready for it."
1567,0,"Sucecesful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.trying new things and taking risks are the significant parts of the succes' i completely  agree with this idea and my arguments for that point are listed as follows

 Firstly , humanbeing has been trying many new things since the initial days of the life this is the source of the improvement ,for instance the telephone is invented by graham bell ,why ? because he was looking for a nwe thing which he needs in his life and it was completely new thing maybe he took risks because it wouldnt be a succesfsful device and after the bell we communication improved and for the present there are mobile phones in our lifes also mobile phone was the new thing before 5 years but now we are looking for some new things..admittedly graham bell is a succesful person because he tried new thing and took risk


 Secondly , being stable is like a death ,movement is the foundationstone of the world.hence the person who doesnt perform anything in his life has to fall down 'for instance foreign languages i have been learnin italian for 2 years, at first it was a new idea for me and i took a risk because of the limited speaking region of italian but i spend many times to learn it and for the present i am working in italian company ,i am not sure that if i am succesful person but exactly it effected my carrier.

 To sum up ;succesful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.because they know that the world  never stops even is known how to turn arround it."
6511,0,"Many students at some point of their lives wonder if they should choose a specialization in their studies or if they should go into a general university to choose classes in many different fields. I think both can be good, but everything depends on what you want to do.
First of all, I believe that it is important that students don't specilize too early. In high schools for instance, it is important that students learn about many different fields before being allowed to choose which major they want to study. It can thus make students discover fields of knowledge they didn't know before, but some fields that can also attract them a lot.
Besides, I think that choosing to specialize or not depends on what kind of job you want to do later. Some jobs requiere good knowledge in many academic fields. This is for instance the case of journalism. Some of the journalists do decide to specialize, but the majority are able to write about every topics, whether it concerns a pension reform or a football match.
On a personal point of view, this attitude - to make the choice of not choosing a specialization - can be very interesting. Somebody who decides not to choose a major field of interests will be interested in much more numerous things than somebody only interested in history or philosophy.  
But I also think that there is a danger for people knowing lots of things, in many fields. The society also needs specialists who deeply know some aspects of the society. For instance, teaching biology requires to be a specialist in biology. And it is the same for all the teachers. In some countries, teachers are teaching two subjects, but I think it is not such a good idea since they can't know very well two fields of knowledge.
To conclude, we can say that societies need both - specialists and people that stay in general knowledge. But personaly, I like having learnt many different subjects before specializing myself. Thanks to this, I discovered what was biology, physics and many other fields that I would not have discovered without my high school classes."
4323,0,"When it comes to advertisements, quite a few people would claim that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the statement. Among countless factors which influence my point. There are three conspicuous aspects as follows:
Firstly, according to a survey, the majority of people have unpleasant associations with some advertisement because they believed  that they once were cheated by some advertisements. These cheats take place everywhere and everytime, on TV, on radio, in supermarket, in cyberspace. Thousands of people are suffering these kinds of advertisements.
Another reason can be seen by everyone is that the purpose of advertisement is to appeal buyers. With the development of high-tech, products are eaeily produced and designed.they are similar to each other not only in design but also in function.  How a factory or a supermarket can win in such keen competing  Advertisement is the key. Although honesty is a very imporatnt in morden society, not all advertisements can be honest. Nobody wants to spend money on useless produces. So those products should be seemed much more better, beautiful, functional than they really are.
Thirdly, for many factories and supermarkets or sales, maybe they consider cheating a part of advertisements.  Advertisement is another beautiful none for cheatig Advertsements can perfect products. There are not products but music, beautiful scenery in them,
Of course, not alll advertisements are cheating. many advertiments are good as well as their products.However, just few of them.
To sum up, I reallly agree with the notion that most advertsements make products seem much better than they really are."

And I learn a lot through the tour guide. When I was young , I had travel with my family by a tour guide.  At that time, tour guide was very wonderful and kind. And the man was kind to us. So I wanted a tour guide. These days, the job which have a tour guide is not good. Like the way travel is have no more self raliance. I just want travel many where. In my case, when i go to travel with some group, I often depend to them about schdule or surrounding life. When I went to Easten Asin, I also depent to my group. I don't adapt another city or surrounding. If I remain another country, at least, I have a one week during a adapt. I thought that this way will break my grow development.  So I will go to travel alone. Actually, I feel a little scared. but until now, I always rely on my parents and my friends. Because of this reason, I didn't have achievement something. I have a plan that go to abroad for study just alone. If i have to do, I will better than now.

6065,0,"I agree with the opinion that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are for the following two reasons.

First, I think that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are in order to attract many people. For example, I think upon the advertisement of Nintendo DS, which is the portable video game machine sold by Nintendo, Japanse famous company of video games. At the TV commertical, Fujisaki Nanako, who is one of the most famous actress in Japan, seems to enjoy playing it. Then, last year I bought it. At first, it is interesting for me. By contrast, within three days, I became boring. Now my Nintendo DS put on the bottom of the box. Nintendo DS is not attracted for me. This example illustrates that in order to attract many people advertisements try to show that  products are better than they really are .

Second, many people agree with the situation that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. For example, when I was a student at Kyoto University, which is one of the most famous college in Japan, I took a brand strategie class, in which we thoght how to make the brand image of the company through case studies. When professor Okada, who was my teacher at the class, discussed about an advertisement of car. In the class discussion, Okaie, who was the best student in my class, stated that in the TV commercial, such as Toyota and Nissan, the car run along the very beautiful road which we had never seen. He mentioned that this situation was only brand strategie and everyone knew that there was not such a beautiful road in Japan. Every student agreed with his opinion. At that time I understood that advertisements made products seem much better than they really were.

Therefore, I definitely agree with the opinion that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are."
10844,0,"I completely agree with the statement from my personal experiences and from my observations.
  The good thing about traveling in a group is that it's easier for travelers. Because the traveling plan is already well arranged by the tour guide, so the travelers don't have to spend lots of time making the plan. The only thing that need is to follow the tour guide and have fun. Also, since they don't need to worry about the schedule, they can completely relax and enjoy the tour. Moreover, to travel in a group is safer because the gangs won't easily conduct crime to the person who are in a group. There is one more benifit for traveling in a group, that is, the price is often lower due to the special discount for group people. Beside, the tour guide is more professional than us, therefore the travelers can get to know many histories and bakcgrounds of the scene. 
  Fot example, from my observations, the honey moon would be the best if traveling in a group led by a tour guide. Because the couple can really enjoy the trip without fighting with each other in where to go or which place to go first. As a results, the new marriage couple can maintain good relationship all along the honey moon.
  On the other hand, when traveling alone, travelers are taking the risks. First, since they might not be familiar with the place they're going to, the plan they made would probably expose themself into the unknown danger. Second, they need to worry about their schedule all the time. That would give them the pressure when traveling and make them become nervous. Third, as compare to the group, the price of traveling alone is often higher. 
  In sum, I agree that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel."
261,0,"I agree with the statement mentioned.Beyond every success there is a risk associated with it.If we consider our renowed scientists and researchers, behind their every success there is a risk .They keep on doing risks in finding out new inventions and new discoveries.
Successful people probably will not wish to do the things which are well known to them because they think in a different way ,aiming high to achieve something which is new.In these aspects they do greater risks to find out new things.They are very much dare enough to do any sort of risk in achieving a positive result.
            For example i consider Madam Curie to be the most risk taking and a most successful scientist.As she laid path in the discovery of ""radium"",a radio active material she took a greater risk in the discovery of radium.She had done a lot of experiments in finding the radio active material.Her experiments involved many risk taking factors in which they are very dangerous.At last she found out the radium after a series of experiments and reasearch.The discovery of radium thus involved many risk factors and atlast she has tasted the success.If she would not had taken the risk means the radium would not have been found till now.
                                In the same way as mentioned above ,successful people always try for new things rather than doing the things which are already very well known to them.Successful people always try new things and new tasks.Its incorporated in them to try for a new one. In this process many scientists have laid path to many inventions such as Marconie invented a radio,Grahambell invented a telephone and so on. 
     So i conclude the essay by stating that risk must be taken by every individual in achieving success and try out for a new thing rather than doing the thing which is known to us."

   and there is some products for a fat peoples they said it w'll make you lose wight and make you thiner but alot of peoples try thats products and didn't lose any wight .


   but some times there a honest advertisments . for example there was an advertisement about some food and they  chalenge any one who can prove that is the product has any unnatural products so when some peoples do some tests for this product they say it was true the product does not contain any unnatural products .

    but the we can't say about advertisements alwayes make thair products better than they really are and in the same time we can not say the opssite because we have the to faces , honest advertisemnents and dishonest advertisements .

But successful people are always trying new things and take risks from that and get well on that. For example successful people are always trying the new things and take risks from that experience and from that experience they will try again and finally they succeed on that.
               Some times these people are trying new things and risks are more from that. These risks are some times giving the negative results and will give the negative consequences also. But these consequences will give the good lesson for doing again that experiment. They know the where it is the mistake and where it is correct for getting the good results.
            I agree with this statement successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. For example i have seen one of my professor he was doing always the new crossings in different crops. He always try to do that which characters are crossed with characters and how it improve the yield parameters in that crops. He always try this crossings and face some of the risks in that crossing programmes and finally  his release the varities of Rice. From this onwards i thought successful people are always trying new things and face the riska and finally they get on well that experiments."

However, it is important for the students to learn facts besause they can know the solution which other people used to risolve a problem.
An advantage to understand ideas is the possibility, that anyone can make, to model those ideas at the situation which anyone could live.
For example, if I know the definition of one mathematic equation, I can applicate this equation everytime that I need modelling the equation at the case which I want to resolve.
An advantage to learn facts is when I have a problem and I can resolve it without energy spent because I already know the solution.

A younger crowd will enjoy attending parties, attending night clubs, doing rather challenging and more physically tiring sports. A middle age person might achieve enjoyment from playing a game of chess or maybe going to the opera and for that middle age person person, attending noisy parties and doing dangerous sports might not be enjoyment at all. Therefore, depending the age that you have, whatever you do will will bring upon it the correct benefit. 
There is a typically trend that young people believe that they enjoy life more than an older person because they believe that the younger you are the more fun you can have, this i believe is incorrect because, yes of course, the younger you are the more options of enjoyment you might think to have. For example, a fatehr of a child would rather much spend time with his son or duaghter rather than attend a gathering full of 20 year olds just because he has different priorities. 
A young person would not enjoy spendign tiem with relatives or older members of his fmaily simply because at that age, you tend to have different obligations, different points of interest and different type of mentality. Younge rpeople tend to fell that as your odl you miss out on what is really fun, but we must remember that older people where young at one point and what a young person thinks an older person will never dream of doing, might just probably mean that it was already done.  Therefore, i do not believe that the younger you are the more fun you have but rather, the older you are your taste of fun change and you rpriorities differ. Enjoyment can be derived from many aspects of life and it is not only allocated to the young adults."
3248,0,"Advertisements is a important part in selling products and a good advertisements will bring benefits. This statement is controversial, in the one hand the advertisements often show a good product, better than the other and the cheapest of the range. In the other hand, some brands are well known, has loyal customers and does not want to lose them by showing products better than they are. However, my personal point of view think that most advertisements make products seem much better than in the reality.

	Firstly, before going any further, I would like to give an example which comes in my mind, the washing powder on advertisements can fight against everything like ice cream on a jean or fruit juice pour on a tee shirt. Moreover, the washing powder can wash efficiently in a cold water so people can save money. According to me, this example seems exagerate to sell a product.

	Secondly, some advertisements put the best product in the advertisement but show the price of a low range product. The goal is to show that everybody can afford to have a good brand. Everybody has already seen a car advertisement, we can see the price written in big and the thing that nobody can see is written in small letters.

	Thirdly, advertising campaigns are very expensive, they use to call actors to show up the products, some professionnals are here to take the best photos they can and the best advertisement to show on television. For instance, when a child acts for a cookie, he always enjoys the product and argue next to her mother to buy this delicious cookies. The advertisement wants to reproduce the scene at home, and generally it works.

	In a nutshell, I am totally convinced that nowadays, to have market shares, advertisements are definitely fake and they show products better than the reality."
6351,0,"Nowadays, it is important in times of applying at a university to consider rather study generalistically or specify in a certain subject. Before applying students should take following aspects in consideration.

Firstly, it is often mentioned that being a specialist of a certain area makes it easier once you finished university to apply for the position you are exactly trained for at an organisation. However, having a broad knowledge of many acadamic subjects gives you the possibility to apply for a wider range of job-ads. Being generalistically offers you a way to enter a company more easily. Once you are received the job you still can and you even have to, no matter being a specialist or a generalist, adopt to tyhe needs of the company you are working for.

Secondely, it is argued that specifying in a certain field does not take the same time as studying the basics of many different areas. To some limited extend there is some truth in it, but, undoubtely, experience shows that no metter what way of studying you have chosen the time until achieving a degree is the same. Nevertheless, doing a generalistical degree is in my point of view better than completing a specific degree that takes the same time. In other words your possibilities are much broader after the study time finding a job then they would only being specified. And the time you have spend remains the same.

To summarize, students first of all should be aware of the consequences when considering applying after they obtained a degree in a specific subject. Furthermore they should mistrust the rumour that studying with the objective to get a broad knowledge of many academic subjects takes the same time then it would achieving a specific degree."

Nowaday,internet is very common.Therefore,every country is conneted with each other.It means everyone will compete to the other people more serious.For examle,ten years ago,the students in Taiwan just needed to compete with the Taiwan people.Now they need to compete with China students or American students.Therefore,students need to have extensive knowledge and it will help them to create new thought.

Next,if we have many professional skills,like computer managing or finanical skill.It can help us to get a high-paid job.Because if the companies hires this kind of people,it seems that they have different fields people.So if we can be this person,we will get a high-paid job,and the companies also can save money to hire many people.But how to let us have broad knowledge?The only way which I think we should learn different academic subjects in the school.If we just focus on one specific subject,we will lose chance.

Some people think if we do not focus on a specific subject,we will not learn very well.We will not be professional in our field.In my opinion,I think it is wrong.If we just learn one field,it may be easy for us.But in future,we will be sad because we can not comete with the other people,Therefore,I agree it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specizlize in one specific subject."

The huge companies main intresrt is to make an advertise for a certan product; also the will hier experts in markiting just to give a good looking for the product. However, these products could be as what they were advertised or could be totaly different. I strongly agree with the statement that says that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. The reason why I agree with this statement is because I dealed with many situations like that before.
	First, I worked  for two years in an advertisement company bake home. It war really famous company and had a world wide name. One day a maneger of a small company came to see the sall man in my company, and theay had a meeting later on. In the meeting the maneger of the small company had a product with him, he showed it to the sale man and told him that this product is not working well and the number of people who are buying this product has decreased. The man that was setting next to the maneger told him that this product will not go well becaused it has a really bad qeuality of materials and the maneger replyed to him "" don't be worry, this advertisement company will increase the sell and the consumers will not notice the bad quality. After two months from advertising for this product, it reaches a really high number of selling; although it has a bad qeuality.
	Second, I was wlaking ond day in the mall and a saw an advertisement for a cellphone. It appered to me that the cellphone can work with really high qeuality in voice and signal. Therefore, I bought the cellphone, but unfortenatily after two days the cellphone did not work with men and nothing happend as i saw in the advertisment.
	In conclusion, an advertisement is a really great and helpful tool to sell any product. On the other hand, it could be used in a good or a bad way. However, some companies started to ubuse this helpful tool >"
7605,0,"I believe that an engineer or a medical doctor, or any academic person should have a basic background of many academic subjects related to his or herscientific interests. However, the level of that knowledge is very important in case of evaluating this issue.  

It is definetly impossible to sepecialize in every particular subjects at a professional level. I strongly believe that people who defends having a knowledge of many academic subjects will fail one day if they insist on practising all those subjects in a professional manner. No doubt, you will neither enough time to practise them at all nor the effort to perform to practise all those professionally.    

However, once you have a fundemental background in many topics, you can develop or improve your skills and experiments in any other specific subjects. Thus, you can have a basic knowledge in numbers of academic subjects and you can keep the potential of this subjects to be turned into practising them in professional way.

The best and most appropriate way is the selection of one or two specific subjects to specialize and to build skills on them. On the other hand, having a basic background and knowledge in some other subjects will increse your reputation in academic world since you have some words to speak regarding on lots of particular problems might be occured in any area.    

To conclude, an academic person should have the basic ideas and the concepts of all subjects related to his or her area. But he or she should select one specific subjects in which he or she will be widespreadly known."
11269,0,"I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do. Because young people can do many things which they want. Young people play many games which older people cant do.Young people rome every where but older people cant because according to their age their stamina will be decreased. Young people have much stamina to do everything.
           The thinking of young people goes with the present generation which older person cant do. For example a young person know much about computer and new softwares. But older people they dont know and they dont need also. A young person can play games to be healthy but a older person, they have to do exercise to be healthy because they cant play all games against the youth. As a people goes old, they behave vey matured . Young person behaves as a child sometimes.
             Young people can enjoy the new technologies and new things in the market. They can get all advantages and make easier all works. Older person cant enjoy with that new technology or science because they have over come with many things in their lives. Young people go to college , office , parties where they can entertain themselves in many ways. But older people cant. Because they have already enjoyed their life. 
             Young people dont have any responsibilty and stress of family. Older people have responsibility and stress with ahich they cant enjoy. They didn't get time after all responsibilities to enjoy. And one thing what older people can do young people cant do. Once in my life i struck in a position that i was not able to solve that problem. That time my grand father handle with that problem and solved. It clearly tell that young people enjoy life when older people take care of them.
            Young people walk with the present life, fashion, styles. Young people enjoy walking with the generation. Older people are simple and make generetion to walk properly."
9492,0,"I disagree with the statement. I believe that youngsters nowadays spend enough time (and more) to help their communities. Let us define what a community is. For most people, a community is a group where the members interact, are interdependant, and where they live in harmony. The young people of the world realise that they are part and parcel of this community and that the development of themselves is dependant on the development of the community and vice versa.
The younger generation is more aware of community welfare, helping people in need, the environment, and its development. One area which the youngsters have identified is charity work. Not only do they visit charity organisations and donate to them, they also organise free medical camps for poor children, corrective surgery for people who cant afford it, and in general spread the word. Campaigns where people can donate or pledge their future contribution are organised by these youngsters. They are conciously allocating time for community welfare activites. Proactively thinking about how much more improvement is possible is the trend. 

Also, people nowadays, especially youngsters, are more aware of the dangers to the environment from deforestation, the ozone layer depletion, etc. These concepts have been imbibed in them from a very small age, because of which they are very aware of the situation. Hence, they make sure they dont cause more damage than they can help. Some of them have pledged to not use plastics after they have understood the harmful nature of it. 

Another aspect of 'community' could be the work environment. Having a pleasant work environment is every employee's dream. This can be acieved only by the cooperation of all the people involved. Realising this, the youngsters make sure they have a nice place to work.

It is very easy to mould young minds and they will be more than willing to help the community and in turn help themselves. This way, they realise, they are giving back to the community that they got from."
7504,0,"I agree with the given statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. 

The possible reason for this kind of behaviour could be lack of concern for their communities. Young people are more enthusiastic and are more busy with their daily lives. Most of the times, as they argue, they do not have time for such activites. But this assumption is appears to be false. They can definitely devote time for this cause. It entirely depends on their disposition. By devoting even an hour for the improvement of the community they can help the community a lot. 

The younger generation thinks that the community is meant for adults and they are the ones who should work for it. But they are mistaken. They do not know that how their help may be beneficial to others. 

The younger generation considers playing games, hanging out with friends and going to parties more important than their participation in the activities of the community. They consider the community activities monotonous and mundane. They prefer ,say, going to a movie or playing basketball over serving to community. They believe that they can have a lot more fun rather than being stuck up in working for the community. They do not realize how important it is to help their neighbours and all they people associated with the community. 

Perhaps, a possible reason for their reluctance may be lack of knowledge of pros and cons of having a community. Adults, on the other hand, have more concern for their communities. They know its importance more than the young people do. They are the ones who can inspire the young people by telling them the importance of these communities, their advantages and disadvantages. If every youngster devotes even an hour to serving the community, they can help a lot."
9132,0,"would age matter for the living style of a person? would it affect the way that the person have the taste of the life? the answer would be quite different if it was asked to people in different age groups. however one cannot miss the the viewpoints of most people being young is more fascinating than being old. in a specific way, young people enjoy the life better than the old people do. there are numerous reasons for this but to state some, it is clear that in youth, people are more active,energetic; young people are more curious than old people that leads them to have a chance to get the joy of life. 
	no need to think much.. first of all it must be stated that young people have more energy than the old peple. this is a fact that no one can deny. being energetic and active makes the young people to have the strength of doing anything that they want. by this way they can experience lots of things. for example generally, an old person would not attempt to ride a motorbike but a young person do. so that they feel the wind breezing on their faces while they go fast and they have the joy of driving fast and as well as the joy of life.
          moreover, young people are more curious almost about everything. for instance the curiousity leads the young people to make a search to find some things new. the joy of making a search, getting their own results and making some interpretations are very valuable experiences for a young. to give an example, mostly for travel, old people go only to a place and have some rest there. but most of the young people do some travellings around the world. this is mostly a result of their curiousity. as long as they are curious young people will find some thing to enjoy with, to be happy with. 
         without any denial, one must accept that the young people do enjoy more than old people. for young people, being active, energetic, curious makes them to go for the things they want to do. by this way they take the taste of their life, and enjoy until they feel themselves as young and they realized that they are not done with the life yet."

Some people might agree with this statement because they think that there will be new transfortation which will replace cars. However, I firmly believe that using car population will go up in the near future. This is because there are more people who want to buy a car due to develop economy and the tecnology of transper combience such as road will also develop.

   First of all, as far as I am concerned, a large number of people want to buy car because of breaktrough of economy. In other words, there will be more people who afford to pay buying car. It is commonly observed that economy became go up as time goes by. For example, in the past, there are a few people who can buy car because it is extreamly expensive to buy. However, as econmy have developed, many people can have atomobile. This is because, the cost of cars have been decreased and people richer relatively than before. Therefore, I think that people who will have car will be increase.

   In addition, tecnology of transpertation infra will also develop with in twenty years. What I am trying to say is that it will be helful to people who want to use car. For instance, many infra's development such as high ways and local roads and solving the problems such as car accidents will give benefit to a great number of divers. So, from my persective, People who usually used other transfertation due to these problems will use more cars. Finally, car drivers will soar.

   In conclusion, there are two main reasons why I think that using car population will incrase. It is not only because there will exist more rich people who can buy car owing to economy boom, but also technology which related wiht car industry will develop."

All to we enjoy..
But I think that young people today can enjoy better than older people did.
I'm a young woman that lived in a time where all I would have or do I could have or do, but I also lived in a small town, where there are not so much service than in bigger city, but i don't think it's a bad thing.
I had the possibility to live in the nature, walk, play, study and feel me good and happy for the small things and, aboveall, I had no kind of stress like the older people did.
Now, that I live in a bigger city than mine, I'm often stressed and nervous for every things I do or think. It is not only a my problem, every day I see around me people that feels like me.
They try to make something for resolve this problem this why they go out often to go to fitness center, in the night to the disco or to cinema to watch, often, some stupid films that, they hope, can give them a pause in their stressed life.
I also think that a lot of things that we do today for enjoy are not so simple and natural like we would, and there are created so much services to try to resolve this great problem of our society..

The use of cars will decline or increase depends a lot on the success of the contemporay researchers success, who are curently working diligently on finding an alternate renewable and cheap source of energy, which may help power the engines of the future automobiles.
              If we do not find a replacement for gasoline as a fuel for driving the cars engines, this exhaustable fuel source will some day deplete. In the situation of reducing supply of the fuel for the car, the prices of the oil will increase, making it less afordable. The car companies may initially decrease the prices of their automobiles to lure the customers harrowed by the increasing oil prices. This price decrease may not last long, since the car companies will realise later that it is more sensible to sell high priced cars to a few people and gain a higher profit by working less, rather than making more cars to gain the same or may be even lower profits. Hence the number of cars on road may decrease.
               Furthermore as the world economies grow more, the governments of the world would try to improve the public transport systems, and recomend to their citizens to favour it over the use of private vehichles. The litreacy rate is also bound to increase with time. Hence the literate and more sensible citizens would readily take the advise of the governments and start favouring public transport. This would again decrease the number of cars.
                If a new renewable and cheap fuel source is invented, initially the automobile industry may suffer due to the technological changes that it may have to adopt but, eventually this may bring about a boom in the automobile industry. People would be interested in trying the new technology, and hence try to adopt it. Cheap and non poluting fuel may make people want to own their own private vehicles. The government will try to subsidise this new fuel to wean off its citizens from the use of gasoline. Such moves will make people want more cars and hence the numbers of the cars on road may increase. The growing population of the world is producing more consumers, hence the number of cars in the given circumstances are bound to increase.
                   Hence in conclusion I would like to say that the question of weather of not the number of cars in the future is goin to decline cannot be answered instantly. It depends on the developments in science in the near future."
5189,0,"I think that trying new things and taking risks is an important factor in becoming a successful person. To argue such an opinion first one has to decide for himself his understanding of success. After all, there are many fields in life in which a person may be successful: as a parent, as an employee, as a student etc. But in each of these areas one will see that when carried out reasonably, attempting new things and taking risks does increase success, becuase it broadens our abilities and perspectives.
	   Today, we are in an age where the progress of things and developments around us happen at a much faster rate than they did in the past. This observation has been made by many people including writers, scientists and socialogists. The rate of changes around us is constantly increasing. These changes include technological progress as well as the characteristics of societies. All of these in my opinion make it inevitable that each individual has to renew themselves and stay up to date with the rapid progress around them both socially and professionally. Otherwise one easily falls behind and because of this may face hardships. For example, a doctor will achieve limited success through time if she confines herself to medical techniques that she already knows. However a successful doctor should also be in a constant search for new techniques, new ways and new knowledge. It is also seen in all social relationships, that the sides often have to renew themselves personally and try new things, especially when there is a question of having to compromise. Problems in friendships can't be solved if the parties aren't willing change their behaviour at times.

2910,0,"I completely disagree with the wiew that young people do not spend enough time helping their communiy. In fact I believe that the most active members of communities are young people.

Community needs are varied, and not are not just limited to helping out elderly people, or servicing in hospitals, or other typically welfare duties. Nonetheless many of the young people I know spend much of their spare time volunteering on ambulances, or performing plays and music for elderly, thus contributing significantly to the total amount of time spent by the communty in general on these tasks, and often being the promoters of such activities.

On top of this I am firmly convinced that communities need spaces and occasions on which to gather, in order to strenghten their mutual ties, to get to know each other better, thus exchanging culture and knowledge. It is my experience that young people are the best and the more commited to organize such events. In fact many of the art displays in my community are organized, and kept running by people in their twenties; and often the works displayed are also made by young people. This shows that young people are helpful to their community in two different ways: they both organize cultural events and are the main cultural point of reference and innovation in the community.

I also know a lot of youngsters involved in politics, both trhough political parties and political associations. I have been in a political association for many years too. In the meetings that were frequently held, important topics regarding our city and province were usually discussed and debated, and often innovative and revolutionary ideas were developed, some of which were later successfully implemented by the local authorities. Moreover an advancement in political and social beliefs will not be possible without the fundamental partecipation of young people to public life.

It is my opinion that this misconception of young people not helping their communities is mainly spread by old conservatives, who fear what new the young generation can bring, and always have their heads turned back, remembering how life was much better when they were young."

	When a child goes to school, they are taught the essentials that they are going to need in their life; reading, writing, listening and leadership. When this child moves on to high school they are taught specifically what they need to learn to fullfill their ambitions. When a child graduates from school they use their previous knowledge to get a work place and a consistant job...then what?
	The person has got this far, yet are they truly successful? are they truly at their full potential? the answer is no! one will never get raised or moved up in the corporate ladder if they are only doing what they are told. This is because everyone else is doing exactly what they are told too. To make ones self stand out they must be able to take risks and put yourself on the line. Show the employer that you are willing to do anything for the cause and you will get moved. However if you stay put and dont take risks then you will not move anywhere and stay at the same level as everyone else that doesn't take a risk.
	A prime example in history is that of Galileo. He took a risk by defying the whole scientific system of his time and saying that the world was round and that the universe was heliocentric (sun in the middle). Of course he was laughed at and not taken seriously, yet now students write about him in formal essays such as this one. This man proved the whole world wrong simply by taking a risk.

It's a common idea that these days, because of our extrem consumer society, young people must be happier than older people but this is completely fake. First young people have more and more trouble then older people are totally taken care thse days.

We can see the world of today offers to young people a real pressure.
First they will have to save the planet earth by cleaning it which is a crucial mission, planet which has been destroy by the older ones.
Secondly, we all know they will have to continue to take care of their parents, maybe grand-parents while they are working hard in this more and more expensive world, for a great part of their own life.
Also, nowadays, youngs struggles in order too make good studies because the elitism has become incredibly awful. They have been constently under pressure seeing their brothers from the south dieing in these terrible situations we watch on tv.

On the other side, older people enjoy life more than anyone by living of their children's money. Spending a lot, destroying the planet even more by polluting or taking expensive hollidays.
They become the little children afterwards, taking care by their own child. Born after the war it's even worst because they have been living in insouciance during their whole life. let's take an other exemple, they are not productive at all whereas they have a lot of power ; blocking the entire economic system,  an enormous political impact. They make stuck the state and the young civilians  who want some changes.

In conclusion we can't admit that the statment is right because, based on the situation of today, every young people will tell you that he is scared for his future and that he thinks he will have to sacrifice for his children not to have the same destiny. Young aren't happy at all and the olders do not care about it. This situation shows the crisis our planet and it population will have to face."

I logically agree with this concept and I think that almost all times hope and a good attitud can make much more than knowledge and money, but the convination of the four things is something amaizing.

	The most impportant thing to really succed in your life is achieve your golds, that is the reason you should be persistant; be proud of yourself, never keeping the felling of knowing that you could do something more, or that you could be part of something but you were too affraid to do it. Don't be affraid, trust in yourself, the most important, believe in you!

	A great example of succed in the life is my sister, Laura Garza, she is the person that I admire the most; she is the kind of persons that  when she propose something, she gets it, no matter what, no matter how much time it gets, no matter how tired she is, no matter how much it costs. I realized that when Laura wants to do something, she does it, as easy as that, I really got astonished when I knew she will go to study  Clinical Phsycology in Washington, and why, just because she wants to do it, and guess what? She is studying in there now. 

	Succes, what is succes? Well, the answer is different to all the people, but the real succes in the life is when you feel comfortable with yourself, when you get up in the mornings and feel you really deserve to be where you are, when you look all around you and finally say: After all my work, I finally get it! But the most important, you should never give up, you should never think, okeay that is enoght; because, it is never enought. 

	You could always be learning and doing something. I asure you that you will get up, and if you have an open mind and a competitive attitude, you will learn something new everyday. Just never give up and you will rich your golds, and really succed in your life."

In fact I have the feeling that one has to discover some new opportunities to be on the front scene. One instance of this is the big computer compamy apple which launched the ""i-pod product"" a few years ago. In fact this device was different from its competitor products. Even the apple project was risky, the consumers adopted it and the sales successfully increased.

In addition, success can not be met if one does not take risk. For example, in financial services company, success means important money gains which is not possible if a minimun risk is not taken. Indeed, warrants provide more hopeful gains than options do but are seven times risky.  

Finally, being successful means being the best of all competitors. One example is the formula one team that has the goal to win the world car championship. Each year, is has to compete with other car brands and try new technologies such as new bumpers to improve the aerodynamic profile of the vehicle, and to invest a lot of money for which it is not sure to get a profit in return.

As a conclusion, for getting success people need to try new opportunities and to take risks that can drive them to the top level situation they have ever dreamt."
10238,0,"It is hard to say that which one is better. But if I were given a chance to choose one of them, I would rather to say that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because understanding ideas and concepts are more beneficial than learning facts. 
	Let's shed some light on the disadvantage of learning facts.  It can be misleading information only if the fact is an exception of the ideas and concepts.  For example, let's assume that some frogs are dark brown but most frogs are green.  If a child looks at the dark brown frog, he of she might consider all frogs as dark brown frogs.  As this example, wrong information may be worse than not knowing.  Also, it has small advantage which is that people learn more vividly.
	On the other hand, to understand ideas and concepts helps people understand facts more.  If someone has no idea about specific idea and concept, he or she might not be able to catch that which ideas of concepts belong to the fact.  Unlikely, if I understood some ideas and concepts, I could handle the fact  better.  From my experience, when I was on camping, I needed a fire.  I realized that I forgot to bring a liter.  Then, I could make a fire easily with glasses because I understood the concept of light reflection. It was very useful.  I was proud myself.  
	As all is concerned, I prefer to understand ideas and concepts.  In my opinion its advantage always overweigh the advantage of to learn facts."

What is difference between people who success and people who do not success. Those people who success do not afraid of tring new things even though they might take risks. This point us nesessary people to have successful live.
                If people do not take risks, they do not have chances either. It is becasue there might be big chance in risks. nobody is knows what is happend in the future. Therefore, people try to find hard something good and something better. If people only do something which already know, thire possibility to be success do not increase. For example, if a person want to change new bussiness. it can say that starting new things and takeing risks because he or she is not sure that the bussiness can be successful or not. However, if he or she do not try, there is not possibility to have successful life at the beggning. The important things that people should try first.  Most of people who have successful life try  new things even though they might ger risks. 
               Moreover, it is not interesting if people only doing what they already know something. If people start leaning new things, they might feel fun or intersting. Becasue of intersts. people try to study or something. Then, these intersts will relate to be successful. For example, if a person likes to cook. he or she wants to feel that I want to study more and lean as much as he or she can. This behavior already starts trying  new things. It is nessesarry to be betetr life. 
                The point that people can try new things with risks might be huge differences between successful people and not succssful people. If people have any possibility. it is better to try to do new things. Nobody knows own furture. Therefore, it is depended on pur determines and decision."

     First of all a man living a monoton live can not be happy.After people taste new things happiness becomes and thank to happiness success becomes.For instance if we think of a people who trys new thinks we can see that he or she is successful.If we consider that's why we'll find the exact answer.Because change is the only thing that never changes.Regularity is boring.Diversity and to alter is amazing.
    Secondly,it is a fact that creating brings success.Being creative is a huge step to forward.For example in businness when comparing two companies people prefer the one which renew itself. Because when one of them sells always the same the thing the other one brings alternatives that they already sold.They sells the old ones and the new ones at the same time.
   Lastly,in our daily lives from our clothes to our minds changing is good.If we always think about old fashions and old times we can never be successful.We have to take risks in all our lives.For example when we join in a new community for make friends we have to take risk.Making friends is one the most significant success in the world.If we always think like""My old friends were different.I could trust them.Now how can i trust someone else""There will be no gamble in our lives and of course no happiness and no real success.\
   To conclude as it mentioned before taking risks and try new things always bring the biggest success in our lives.If people want to be happy and successful they should fit in the new world and change when it is necessary.Whether in our daily lives,school or in businness life or private life to have success it is important to renew.So that as successfull people know how to reach success they all try new things and their lives always contains gambles."

I am convinced about the great importance of mastering at least several subjects in order to increase our general knowledges, It seems nowadays indispensable to be aware of a lot of subjects that belong to varied 
for example, we are to be able to talk about politics,ecology,communication and business,and this would not be possible if we did not get broad knowledge in history, biology or mathematics,If not, we will not feel concerned about very important subjects that are part of our life,
That the reason why we need to accumulate a lot of knowledge while we are still in college,

After being part of this learning process, and only after that, you will be able to choose one specific subject that corresponds truly to your personality, your skills and your motivation.Then, you might be further in the subject you have chosen to express yourself in the best way,
Whether if you were previously not interested in other general subjects, I am afraid that it would be difficult to envision things in a very mature and complete way,

Although having lots of information releated to anything, it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.

 If you want to have broad knowledge, you have to work hard on everything. This way is very difficult for people. In addition, you can not achive something properly  if you chose broad knowledge. Furthermore you can not know everything about your subjects, because you have to study for every subjects.
 
 On the other hand, specialize in one specific subject  is not difficult as another because, they have to work on only one topic. This event provide some adventages for you. For example; because you work on only one topic, you can do your researches broadly and you know everything about this subject.

623,0,"I certainly disagree with the statement that ""young people enjoy life more than older people do"". I will explain my point of view along with some examples.

First of all this statement can not be generalized. There might be some young people that do enjoy their life more than some people that are older. Although I do not think this is connected with their age but more with a general attitude towards life. For example an older person could be more pessimistic than a younger person. But this person might have been more pessimistic througout his hole life, even when he or she still used to be young. 

I do believe that there is different ways of enjoyment and different areas that old and young people do get enjoment from. In my opinion this is connected to the differentent life spans people are in at different ages. Each life span, like the toddler `s, the teenager`s or the adult one, brings along different tasks. Let`s say a teenager does live more on the riskier side of life and does take drugs from time to time or have more liberal sex habits than an adult would practize, this might be due to his wish to experience independence or to define his own personality by testing his own and the society`s limits. That is a normal behavoiur for his age and role in our western society. In todays society a more liberal way of life and expression is often taken as a symbol for a happier life. This does not neccessary hold true. Some of these teens, asked about their amount of joy in life, might not be happy with what they have at all. On the other hand an older adult, living more quietly with his family and having a satisfiying job, might not look as happy at first but if asked migth show a quiet high level of life satisfaction. This so called joy in life could maybe better be described by the word happiness or life satisfaction.

Also another point is that there is a confusion between seeing the older people`s life style, that indeed might look a little boring an less enjoable to a younger person, as connected to their age. Even when the really old people of todaz were young their values were different to ours. Thez just continued living them until today. This is not boring for them, but to us it looks b"

In contrast, some poeple think that they are really helphul.  In my opinion, young poeple give enough time to helping their communities because there are many projects for them, schools encourage them to help their communities.  Furthermore, the internet made it easy to get information about their communities.  It makes them think they should help their communities.
    Firstly, I reckon that young people are trying to help their communities because I saw a lot of projects for them in my home towm.  For instance, young people in my towm clean up the roads every weekends.  It is because the city put information on the city bulletin board.  There are various kinds of projects like that.  
    Secondly, young people do give enough time to contributing their communities because schools require them to do so.  For example, in my high school, it was mandatory to clean the river once a month.  Moreover, we should wrote letters to elderies, visit their homes and have a conversation with them.  There are many schools which do similar things.  Consequently, I consider young poeple spend much time to help their communities.
     Thirdly, there are many young people who are using the internet and get information of their communities.  As a result, they can realize the problems of their cities.  In my home town, there are many students who are using the internet.  They can learn about their town easily by it.  One of my friends said that he came to think a lot about his town.  There are many young people him in my town.

Companies use techonology to create a good advertisements for their products.They use colors, images, ext. which attract people to buy those products. 

	Advertisement is a important isue to sell products. Good advertisements have advantages for products which is advertise. In the advertisements, they try to show products much better than they really are. They use visiual things or they use sounds to make the advertisement more colorful. Most of the time, those things attract people to buy those products which has a increadible advertisement. For example, my father bought a sprey for his car. In this sprey's advertisement, they show a  red BMW car which has some spots on it is cleaned with this sprey perfectly and also in the advertisement they show some references for that sprey. My father's car has some same spot too and my father belive that advertisement and these references and he decided to buy that products shown in that advertisement. This sprey did not work on my father's car. It caused to change colors where he used it on the car. when he searchen why it did not work he figured out that sprey not used for all spot occured on the car, but in the advertisement, they do not warn you that what kind of spot is ok for this sprey.

	Advertisements use to introduce the product to the public. They try to show the product much better than they are. Because of that kind of advertisements people get wrong idea about products most of the time. By advertisements, companies want make more money so they can use all techonogical ways to attract people to buy their products, but this kind of advertisement do not make their product better but they make money for sure."
3518,0,"It is of course crucial that students understand first of all ideas and concepts; one cannot build a genuine knowledge of literature for example, if one does not understand notions like romanticism, modernism, post-modernism, etc...These notions are a great help to understand and define similarities between writers (or their differences), and it allows the student to categorize them, and to see if these categories really fit them or if they can be challenged. 
The purpose of these big concepts is to create categories, types, which provide landmarks for the student. If we think of history, it is impossible to understand the history of the xxth century without being able to define and understand major concepts such as facism, communism, capitalism, or feminism, since all these concepts are significant of a certain era, and of certain ways of thinking. 
However, understanding concepts and ideas is useless if the student is unable to relate them to actual facts; indeed, it is difficult to write an essay on the evolution of the feminist movement in a given time period if the only thing the student remembers is the definition of feminism. One needs facts to support one's point, and what is more, the student will not be able to handle the notions easily if he has no actual facts to relate them to, and to clarify his or her point. Facts are often very useful to understand better the concepts, and they also allow us to illustrate our point. In this perspective, a teacher will rely on facts to illustrate or prove his or her point; it is easier to convey the meaning of a given concept through an illustration, and it is also easier to remember for the student, especially if the example given is shocking, or amusing. A mere knowledge of the general concepts and ideas would be too restrictive, and would result in a superficial knowledge, which is not very useful in the end. On the other hand, a good mastery of both concepts and facts will allow the student to have in-depth knowledge, which is the most important. In that sense, it is impossible to focus only on the general ideas and to leave out the facts."
9384,0,"In our world, advertisements are maybe everywhere, and therefore our lives are strongly influenced by this form of communication.
I think that very often advertisements try to present a product in such a way that it seems better than it really is. This can be done in many ways.
For example, last year I had to change my car and I saw the commercial of a very cheap and beautiful car at the TV: I suddenly falled in love with it. When I saw this car in my city, I discovered that the appealing of the real car was very different from the appealing of the car in the commercials, and obiously I changed my opinion about this product. The *real* car was tiny, and not very pretty.
Sometimes, commercials triy to ameliorate a product by other methods: for example, the advertisement of an expensive product could not speak about the price of this product. Or the commercial of an experimental product, could not metion that (important!) fact: in my Country, a few years ago, it has been a case of this type, concerning the sell of a diet drink which were not completely tested.
I guess that the strategy of commercials that try to ameliorate a product is logical, in a strictly economical sense. In fact, the purpose of the advertisements is to push a person to buy some product. But, since I am a person, I think that this strategy is cynical and sometimes sordid.
I guess that if commericials were made honestly and carefully, then they could become a very useful and quick way to learn about new products. Advertisements could be, in this case, a source of informations for every person, because they're everywhere and they're easy to understand. 
But if a person knows that very often advertisements make a product much better than it really is, then this person could not consider commercials as a source of nice and simple informations. This person will be diffident, and - as an intelligent person - he/she will not be too much influenced by commercials."
321,0,"The issue of is it more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than is it for them to learn facts is difficult to deal with because you can not understand abstract concepts without facts but on the other hand you can not understand facts without explaination.
It remains that i think this is more importante to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts without understandness.

To illustrate my point of view i am going to give three arguments with exemples.

Firtly, by understanding ideas and concepts you keep a criticise view on the world. we know that to the govern the France we need a president. This is a concept. After we can think about who could be the good one among peaple who would like to become president.

Secondly, this is evident that to understand how our world works, we need to learn general concepts and ideas. and after that we can do our own life in starting from this base. For exemple if you want to learn things at school, before you have to learn how to behave in a school and which are the rules of the school. 

Finally, understand ideas and concepts suppose that you use your brain, you have think about these concepts and ideas. It choose that you are clever if you try to understand concept before learning example because this is the logical way of doing. At the opposite, there are people who learn supidly facts and example without understand anything. This kind of people are good at TV games but that all. They have not a critisize point of view on the world. We could even say that theses persons are dangerous for the society as they can as extremist feelings.

To Conclude, i would say that as  i am a scientific this is logical for me to learn concepts. many people say that this is too abstract but i think this is the good way to understand the world: First concepts and them facts which support the concept."
1472,0,"How often have people traveled on their own? In groups? By couple or with their class? what is the best way to travel to a country? Opinions differ depending on  people, but I believe that the best way to travel and to learn about a country is by being led by a tour guide.

	First, a tour guide can help us travelling in the country. I remember the time I travelled in Italy with my parents, we took a guide who made us a visit of the entire Rome. He knew every corner of the city as if it was himself. We took the subway and we were amazingly surprised of how many stations and changements we had to make. Because we could not speak Italian, travelling alone would have been much more difficult without a guide. Thanks to our tour guide, we were spared interminable hours of wander in the intricate streets of Rome.

	Secondly, a tour guide can give us some historical background that are specific to the country or to the region. Our Italian guide, named Gino, explained to us in details the history of the Coliseum. We thought we knew already enormously about the site, for we have read many books about it, but we never knew how it was built, in how much time it was built, and why was it a phenomenon in Rome. He explained us how Italy undergoed a chaotic period during the civil war and the Second World War, facts that have not always been explained concisely. But he also talked to us about Italian legends, that are only known by Italians. He also familiarized us with the traditional italian music which originally bloomed during the Renaissance. Gino also talked to us about the great thinkers, mathematicians, musicians, politicians and dictators of their country and I had to admit that I could never have thought about them if we were not guided by Gino.

	Thirdly, if we are not completly familiar with a country's language, people, or food , a tour guide can always facilitate our task. I remember how lost my parents and I were the first day we arrived in Rome. We couldn't speak Italian and because we were tourists, some Italians took advantage of the situation to make us pay more than the regular prices in restaurants. Gino got furious against the waiter and when we asked him what happened, we were horrified to realize that the waiter wanted to make us pay the bread, the table, the glasses, the fourks and knives. Apart from this little misunderstanding, Gino always had great Museum, restaurants, bars, adresses. He would recommend us the best Italian pasta dishes and would bring us the great comedy shows! He would also bargain with street sellers so that we could afford cheaply a Dolce et Gabbana pair of glasses or a perfect imitation of a Gucci bag. 

	I believe that my experience in Rome clearly demonstrated the fact that it is best to travel somewhere by being led by a tour guide. For he is more experienced and familiar to his country's lifestyle and people."
339,0,"If I have to decide whether I agree or disagree with the the claim that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning the facts for students, I would disagree this claim. Students need to have concrete fknowledge of facts to be an educated intellectual.

  I would like to give an example about learning a forein language. When people learn a foreign language, it is important to understand its grammar, how the words are integrated,  and its pragmatics, how people use the target language to achieve their goal. However, even if you understand the grammar and the pragmatics which could be considered as ideas and concepts of a language, it does not assure you are able to speak the target language. You might be able to be a very successful scholar of the language, but you might not be able to speak the language at all. In order to speak a language, you have to memorize vocabulary and idioms and learn sentences and dialogues which could be considered as a process of learning facts.

   If we educated all students to become a scholar, the approach focusing more on understanding ideas and concepts would be effective, but students will take different carreers. Educators should provide opportunities for them to learn enough knowledge to survive the real world. Moreover, in order to understand ideas and concepts deeply, concrete knowledge of facts is inevitable. 

   Therefore, I strongly believe that students need focus on learning facts, not just understading ideas and concepts. It is not only for students to prepare the time when they get out of schools, but also It will help students to undersatnd ideas and concpets more profound ly than when they do not have enough knowledge about those."
2998,0,"Cars are freedom and independence! That's what many people think about cars offering them the opportunity to travel individually everytime and to whereever they want. I think that therefore in twenty years there will be at least as many cars used in the world as there are nowadays, and I'll try to show some more reasons for that in this essay.

First of all, people are very slow in changing their habits, so even a new technology would not suddenly stop them all driving cars. And there is no technology to expect in the next few years that could challenge with that flexibility of a cabin that can be freely driven by one person, in other words it seems that there will be no alternative to cars for years.
 
If you think about cars in the future you should definetly take a closer look at Asia. China and India develop quickly and will soon use a lot of cars, and remember that we are talking about nearly one third of the world's population! Noone could stop them from using that easy and quick transportation technology, so they will be happy to start using it like the western world was in the middle of the last century.

Some people say that there would not be enough oil for future use of cars. But experts predicts that the oil would last for at least another 50 years and in addition every year more fields are discovered.

To come back to the first and most important point, the flexibility of cars offering independence to their drivers, it has to be asked if you would be giving up that opportunity just for saving the environment or stop the traffic and noise on the streets. While everyone knows that cars seriously pollute the air noone would stop using them for that reason, because they are not able to see the consequences of that pollution directly or do not recognize them.

All at all, there won't be fewer cars in the future and in twenty years we have to expect an even bigger number than today."

       For ex.if you want to learn about the maths and you want to remember the formula's associated with that.In this case if you trying to mugup all the formula's rather then understanding the logic behind that ,then definitely after some time you can't remember it.On the other hand if learn it with the help of concepts and the facts behind them then you can easyily memorize them amd you also get the knowledge about how to use them.
    Let take the another example,if you want to learn about the electronics,and you want to learn that how to make a circuit ,then at that time if you don't know about the basis things and requirement then you can not even make the simple thinks.On the other hand if you have the knowledge about all the things then you can easily make anything whatever you want to make.
    On the top of that if chosse the right way to learn the thing like with the help of examples and figures then you can memorize them easily and with the faster speed.You can also consult with the experts of the particuler subject,who gives you the batter explanation of the topic then you can understand it more accurely.Even if you have all the idea about any thing then it will also help you to solve the aptitude questions in examination,which need the concepts behind the subject.

3090,0,"In our world are a lot of products and every day more products are created . They are very big differences between them. In my opinion most products could be been better as they are and the advertisments show us.

There are a lot of products, which are really good, like different kinds of water. On the other hand, there are a lot of products, which could be been better like jeans. I think that in the past the jeans had a better quality then now. For this there are some reasons. My first reason is that people buy cheaper jeans in lower quality and the big firms like Lewis had to get also cheaper prices, but on the other hand I think that the new designs had change the quality. There we can see the problem of the advertisments. They show us, the need of a new style, but they do not speak about lower quality. It decrease of cause of chemicals, which are need for the producing. An example are jeans in white color, because they were produced in blue and then the color is destroid.

An other example is perhaps that advertisments always have the best shower gel. I think that it was good for a log time, but every new product is a lot of better then the one before. I can not belive that it is possible to create every few month an other one, which is better than the one before. Furthermore they show us thinks, which make the product better, but it was always insite. 

I think that most products are good, but not so good, as advertisments show us. On the other site it is there job to show us that we have to spend money for new thinks. Normally that is a good way, because the firms have to spend money for there research and research is a very fundamental thing in our world."
5206,0,"I think first that both the younger and older people both enjoy their lives but I think that older people enjoy thier life more.
I am convinced with that for several reasons.
One important reason is that in order to enjoy your life you should feel secure and relax. 
I think older people feel more secure because they have already featured their lives.
Another reason of why old people enjoy their lives more is their financial status as generally the old people are richer than younger ones which helps them going on trips or performing a lot of activities. 
I think that the older people will not have as much commitments as the younger people have as in young age the person is always in stress looking towards building a successfull future, this of course takes a lot of his time as he has to study many courses and prepare himself for entering the professional life. After that the young people become busy with thier new jobs they try to progress in their carreers and make money. They after that become concerned with building their own families by marriage and having babies. They remain always like this living in stress trying to accomplish many tasks and reach many goals until they reach to a relatively comfortable life.
At this time only the begin thinking about enjoying their lives and spending a good time performing activities.
Taking myself as an example I think I am not enjoying my life uptill the moment because I am always struggling to have a good life I wish for myself and my small family. I have always to study additional courses, I spend my money in this courses but I think this is mandatory to earn a degree as well as to increase my experience so that I get better job with higher salary.
But if I look to my parents I find that they enjoy their lives now, they go regularly to trips, they attend live performances and they enjoy practicing their hobbies as drawing and reading.
But of course I think that if I had a lot of money and a good job while I am young this will be the best option as I can enjoy travelling, playing soccer matches and practicing some risky activities as climbing mountains and diving.
But I believe that man can't get all what he wants at the same time, so I am building my future now and I wish I can enjoy my life at a later period."

Secondly, I belive that cars should be used better because, nowadays, a family have two or three car but these cars often aren't used. So i thin that cars sharing should be a solution of this problem.

9502,0,"Nowadays, tourism has become an important part of the entertainement industry, especially in the Western societies. People tired -and sometimes fed up- with their jobs always keep an eye on their agenda, waiting for the next vacation. But when this day arrives, people usually have to face a dramatic dilemma: do  they have to travel by their own or with a tour guide? This issue has been largely debated for the next ten years and is at the heart of the political campaign of many countries.

Travelling by your own implies that you can be organized: you have to book the hotel yourself and you have to speak the language of the country you plan to visit. Overall, it will be difficult to understand the story and to appreciate the monuments you visit, except if you already know the culture of the country very well.

Actually, the choice depends of the type of vacation you like.
For instance, if I go on vacation to the beach and that my aim is to have fun playing volley ball and having a nap while staring at the sea, it is not obvious that I need to be led by a tour guide. Actually I can still do so, but the role of the guide will be slightly reduce, since there is nothing special to visit.
On the other hand, if you prefer a cultural trip, things are different, and you might need a tour guide as I said belove. I would say that being led by a tour guide is the best way to travel if you fancy cultural trip.

My point of vue is that I prefer travelling on my own. Thus I can make cultural discovery and meet the inhabitants of the country I am visiting. Furthermore, I can practice my foreign language.
That's it: next vacation I will go to a English speaking country, so I could practice my English. I will lose my horrible french accent.
And I will not need to pass the Toefl exam anymore. Therefore I will no longer bother an anonymous corrector with stupid essay ;)"

But people will became use so many eco car.The eco car is good for environment and us.Cars that  we use now emit so bad fuel such as flon, carbon dioxide. We must change these bad car to good car for environment. The good car is developing a little by little now. They are moved by solar energy.So they do not emit bad fuels. A few people use the eco car now to stop the global warmming. The global warmming result from the emittion flon gus of car and dicreasing of wood. Both things were occored by people activity. So it shold be stop by us. That we should change the car to good car for environment."
10530,0,"I agree that there will be fewer cars on the road than before as there are many factors that will lead to the decline, if the population is not changed by migration. Few factors are, increasing cost of oil, environment pollution, trafffic congestion which leads to delays, parking problems, higher maintenance etc.
     The increase in cost of oil recently has made people to look for more efficient modes of travel. The environmental activists are pressing hard to cut on carbondioxide emissions, and the successful atlernate to hydrocarbon oils are yet to developed. 
     Now in the present circumstances, the city roads are unable to handle the pool of cars and every commuter is getting frustrated by traffic congestion and has changed his life style to avoid traffic.They are resorting to public transportation, car pooling or taking up residential units near to the workplace.
     One more factor that can contribute to the decline is the less space available in the cities for car parking. It has become nightmare now to find parking specially near corporate offices and busy market places.
     The cost to maintain a car is high and going up when compared to motorcycles, which is prompting many to dump their cars in favour of two wheelers as it is helping them to cut costs on fuel, maintenance, parking  and above all reduces a lot of time in conveyance.
     Gone are the days when people use to have cars, primarily for their social status, as cars have become increasingly affordable, a person with average income is able to maintain a car.
     In my family we use to have three cars a year ago, but with unexpected surge in traffic, parking and maintenance we got rid of one car and the remaining two we are using it only when it is required.  
Considering above reasons, I feel there will be less cars on road twenty years after,  than it is now."
7215,0,"I disagree with that young people enjoy life more than older people do.There are three reasons.
 First, older people have much time than young people because after older people retired thier jobs, they can enjoy the second life slowly. When they were working, they were so busy that they could not do what they want to. Besides, they could not take many vacations.They can do things which they could not do when they were working because they have a lot of time. However, young people don't have a lot of time. They have to go to school or work. Students have exams. They are recqired to study harder and harder for exams.
 Second, they have more money than young people. When they were working, they would save money for their future.They can buy what they want, go where they want to and eat what they want to.
 Finally,of course older people have experienced a lot of things.They know what they should do when a problem happens. They also know how to avoid a problem. They would experience hard things that as if it seemed that they could not solve the problem, but young people have not experienced such a thing yet. Even if young people have experienced such a thing, the number would much less than those of older people."
2946,0,"Given an oppurtunity I would like to answer the question basing on the country about which the question is being asked. In my perception the answer completely depends on the nature of the nation and the people about which we are talking about. So I would like to both agree and disagree with the given statement.
  In the present day world we have nations with various economic status. There are developed nations, developing nations and underdeveloped nations. We can see a definite distribution of the number of cars in relation with a country's economic status. A developed country has more number of cars per capita than developing countries which are followed by underdeveloped countries. Since much of the world population still lives in developing or under developed countries we can say that number of people owning cars in the present day is less compared to that who don't own. 
      As time passes nations gradually develop and the per-capita income also increases so the purchasing power of a citizen. So we can see that number of cars should rise in the next twenty years. But this alone is not the point. 
     As the number of cars increases the fuel consumption in countries would also increase leading to a fuel scarcity and hence price rise. But this will again not be the same globally. Countries which are rich in oil will have a comparatively much lesser price rise than others in case they don't want to export their oil. So we can clearly see that the citizens in these countries can afford to buy more cars than others leading to an increase in number of cars. 
 Another point to make is environmental concern. Since increase in number of cars would lead to an increase in green house effect people concerned about the same would tend not to use cars. But again we lack the data regarding how much of the world population is ready to give up the comfort of using cars for sake of environment.
  Another important point to think about is the public transport system in a country. If the government improves the same people may tend to use cars in a lesser number. This again would vary from country to country. 
    Since I have no information about the above mentoined points I can't caste my vote to whether number of cars would increase or decrease. If I were given the data regarding the growth rate of various countries their population, their economic policies only then can I clearly say whether there would be an increase or decrease in number or cars."
3244,0,"Advertisements are the most common and colorful part of our lives in the 21st century. Everyday another selection for a material is made or invented and coming to our TVs or newspaper pages to show us his advantages. people have different ideas about the issue that most adverstisements make products seem much better than they really are. Some think that it is right others think that it is a wrong way of thinking. I'm personally agree with the firt ones.

First of all, advertisements make the products seem bigger. Every advertisement is a little circus show to make you believe that 'this one' is the 'one' that you have been looking for since your childhood. To make you believe they will try every method, especially do not believe in the size of the product in the television. For example last year a newspaper begin to promote a tape. The tape was the best that I have ever seen, I mean 'the tape of my life'. I ordered the product and when the box came to my home I was really amazed, however, there was a little problem; the tape was more little than I saw it in the advertisement. 

Secondly, most advertisements make the audience believe that the product is cheaper. The life in big cities like my own is very expensive to live. So, I am really careful about spending my money and always looking for the prices of the materials that I will buy and I am always looking for the information on prices in the advertisements. For the 20th birthday of my best friend I promised her to buy the dress that we saw in the magazine together. In the adverstisement it was not looking so expensive. I was thinking like that until I went the store to buy it.  It was much more expensive than we read.  

Lastly, advertisements make the material seem more useful. For instance, a friend of mine who has a kilo problem, began to use a material advertised as a 'losing calorie miracle in 3 months', it has been 6 months and she is not looking lose much more than only 1 kilo...The product seem her much more useful than she experienced. Thus the information told by advertisers is not so accurate and convincable.

All in all, adverstising a product is something made to show that it is the best that you've ever seen. So, the advertisers will try to fascinate the audience and by making the stuff seem better than it really is, they reach their goals. The products shown in the advertisement can be smaller, more expensive and less useful than it is seem to you."
5690,0,"When we are young we are more energitic, more powerfull, more encouraging and also more willing to do new things in every part of life. So i think yes young peoples enjoy life more than older people do.

             People who are older cant enjoy that much how much younger people can. Younger people can go for trip like rock climbing, rappling and all which old people cant. Because of there heart problem or even they get tired very easily because of there age.

            Normally old peoples dont go to collage for studies and all where young peoples have most of there fun. They can new  friends, go for parties with friends, can go for trips and all. Which old peolpes cant do because of there health.

            Take an example of new year when every young peoples go for parties and all, then they came late at night and again on other day they go to collage with that energy and again have fun which tell us that life is more enjoyable for the young peoples.

            Normally each and every young people like to drive bikes and car very fast, they know that its very dangerous and even i know that they enjoy that also. Which after an particular age they cant enjoy. 

           Even you can see in live world that every rock star, actors and good dancers are normally young. There can be old also but mostly they are young. Even all cricketers or athlics are young who can enjoy sports in that particular age limits.This all tells us that more or less young people enjoy more then old ones.

           So from all the points above we can note that young enjoy very much more than old peoples but every old goes once from young."
1108,0,"I definetely agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. 
      It is not exaggeration that we now live in cars society. Cars made a revolution of transformation method, they established the position as the most convenient transportation method. Besides, car market is also one of the biggest commercial markets, and cars are essential to our economy. Considering the statement, however, we need to pay attention to the disadvantags of them. 
      Using cars cause the enrvironmental problem; for example,  an air pollution and the earth warming.As the gas which are excluded from each car contaminates the air especially in the city, people are suffering from the uncleared air. To make matters worse, it is reported that it can cause the earth warming, which is the biggest environmental problem not only for the people of city dwellers but also the people in the world. Moreover, in terms of the natural resorces, cars requires a lot of gasoline to mobilize them. Gasoline are made by refining the petrogen, which is said to run out in 25 years in the earth. From the point of the human society, using cars generates a number of traffic accidents due to the careless mistakes or the drive by the drunker. Traffic accidents are the social problem in my country, Japan, and more than 10000 people are killed every year.
        Considering the other transportation method, such as the plane, the train, the bus, there are more advantages than cars have. These public transportation system can carry much more people, and save the fuel and natural resorces. Accordingly, they don't pollute the environment as much as the cars. In terms of safety, they can lose the possibilities of facing the accidents by using these system. The rate of encounting accidents of public system are much lower than the cars. If you can dring a lot or get tired, you can go home by using them.
       As I mentioned above, there are more good points in using public transportation system. Of course, cars provides us the enlightment of driving and some people are fascinated with the speed. But now we need to take care of the disadvantages in terms of the envirnment and safety. I believe people will soon give up using cars, and use public system in stead."
7711,0,"Some people would think specialize knowledge is the most important, however I prefer to choose the broad knowledge of many academic subject. There are theree reasons for this: to have many information,  to have  wide view points and to make own  new field.
     First of all, the foundation of our knowledge was decided be the quantity of the imformation. For instance, I major bussiness administration in my university. If I do not study about not only foundamental  bussiness theory but also other advertizement theory, I can not know deeply about marketing theory. Likethis,Bord knowledge is  essentioal.
     Secondly, if a persson consentrate on only the specific field,they will not be able to have wide view point. In jeneral speaking, like these kinds of people can not understand other peoples idea so they will have bias thinking way. Adding to this, these kinds people like to be minority, so they will have difficult time in their life.
     Finally, in order to make own new field, it is better to have wide knowledge. Noneless to say, new theory is made by the combain of the  fandamental knowledoge which saomeone have. If a person specialize in a specific problem, there will be limit of them. Because, new field is introduced by creative thinking based on the wide information.
     From these reasons, I think  if a person concentrate on the specific field , there are more less potentioal in their future.Truly, studying only one subject which a person really want to study is important things. Yet, when we think about this problem from long term. Clealy, having vast knowledge of many kinds of academic subject is more good for the person's future."
6937,0,"When it come to traveling in a group some people may say that the best way to do so is led by a tour guide; I personally disagree with that oppinion. It's true that having a tour guide has its advantages such as being taken to all the typical local turist attractions, you will be almost sertain that you won't be missing out on any must see places. Yet, in the other had, having a tour guide limits your freetime. When traveling in a group you want to spend time with your friends, and spending it as you wish; not having to be tied to a schedule as it is when using a tour guide. It could also be said that when traveling in big groups, people always want to see different things, and arguments may occur. Although having a tour guide could prevent this disagreements by simply following the itinerary set for that day, theres a better way to solve the problem. The group could just simply seperate, each person goes to where they want, and at the end of the day meet again. The advantage of this solution is that when a big number of people are together for a period of time, usually arguments happen; by sending each person on their different way it gives them time to refresh from the enviroment of the group. Most important of all, of why is better to travel without a tour guide, it that having a tour guide babysitting you around the city take away a great part of the social and cultural interaction. The experience that you earn when you explore an unknown city on your own is something that cannot be showed by a tour guide. In conclusion, for all the reasons named above,  my suggestion when it comes to travaling in a group is to not hire a tour guide and explore the city on your own along with your friends."
